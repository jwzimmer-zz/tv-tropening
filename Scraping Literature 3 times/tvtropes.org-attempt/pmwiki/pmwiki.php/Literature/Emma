Emma is an accomplished young lady, but she could have achieved much more had she been more diligent in her reading, painting, or playing the piano and singing. Jane Fairfax knows she's destined to be a governess, so she works harder and accordingly, her performance in music is extraordinary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppetiteEqualsHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppetiteEqualsHealth">Appetite = Health</a>: Miss Jane Fairfax has been down with cold and hasn't completely recovered.

Her long monologues, apparently about nothing, often reveal secrets that no one realises because they don't pay her proper attention.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>:<ul><li> Donwell Abbey is Mr Knightley's family estate. It's very old and traditional, with gardens and orchards, a lime avenue, with farms and tenants renting the land. The house itself is huge and some of the rooms are furnished exquisitely.</li><li> Hartfield, a house which belongs to the Woodhouses. It's smaller than Donwell Abbey - just a "notch" in the estate - but it has a nice park and an attached farm, and it's modern and elegant, decorated and furnished with Emma's taste.</li><li> Enscombe,, a large and rather secluded estate in the north of England, the seat of the snobby Churchills. Never seen first hand.</li><li> Maple Grove is a house with land bought by Mr Suckling, brother-in-law of Mrs Elton. She keeps gushing about the house, its parks, its gardens, servants, carriages...

He seems like a polite, gentlemanly (if slightly empty-headed) young man up until he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> declares his love for Emma</span>, after which he is increasingly shown to be a callous jerk and a thorough snob.

She is a very endearing character &mdash; open, sweet, generous, witty, energetic, a loyal friend and a devoted daughter; she is also what by modern standards might fairly be called a snob. Mr Knightley guides her and calls her on her bad behaviour sometimes and by the end of the novel she's much better.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBonfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBonfire">Breakup Bonfire</a>: After showing them to Emma, Harriet Smith throws her (pretty pathetic) mementos of Mr Elton into a fire.

It's mostly because he's a very old gentleman, though it's implied he has always been domestic. His wife was a much stronger and more reasonable figure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a>: Miss Bates has a tendency to provide valuable insight into what characters in the story are thinking, but most people don't care or notice because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">rambles on and on and on</a>. Even the readers usually ignore what she says because of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText">Walls of Text</a> nature.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Childhood Friend Romance</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Emma and Mr Knightley.

Her close friends know about her opinion and they quite agree because Mrs Elton is really obnoxious. However, Emma doesn't want <em>other</em> people in Highbury to know about it, so she might occasionally mention that Mrs Elton is "very pleasant and very elegantly dressed".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife">Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life</a>: Emma takes care of her father and is the mistress of Hartfield, but gets bored. Her purpose in life becomes attempting to make matches in the village among her acquaintances, which (nearly always) ends disastrously.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscretionShot">Discretion Shot</a>: The Georgian novel version. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the scene where Mr Knightley confesses his love to Emma</span>, Austen uses her narrative technique to tell us what Emma thinks of what he's saying, but without actually reporting the words. When it's time for Emma to speak in turn, we get this gem:<div class="indent">What did she say? Just what she ought, of course. A lady always does.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleInLawMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleInLawMarriage">Double In-Law Marriage</a>: By the end of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sisters Isabella and Emma Woodhouse are married to brothers John and George Knightley.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">Doting Parent</a>:<ul><li> Mr Woodhouse adores his daughters, and would be vastly troubled by the idea that anyone would think Emma less than perfect.</li><li> Mrs Weston (formerly Miss Taylor) is Emma's childhood governess, and not much less inclined than Mr Woodhouse to think her anything but flawless.</li><li> Isabella is shown to be a very loving mother to her five small children. She's particularly anxious about their health.</li><li> Miss Bates is a doting aunt to Jane Fairfax, always praising her and admiring her. She supposes her Jane is a favorite with everybody. Emma find her praises quite tiresome.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantClassicalMusician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantClassicalMusician">Elegant Classical Musician</a>: Both Emma and Jane Fairfax play the piano and people find it attractive. It helps that they are also great beauties.<ul><li> Emma is very talented, but she never bothered to practice regularly as a child. She's still more than just a decent pianist and she plays and sings very well, but whenever Jane visits her relatives in Highbury, Emma is vexed that she's no longer the best musician.</li><li> Jane Fairfax was brought up in London and had lessons with the best masters, fulfilling her potential. Everybody admires her dedication to music and urges her to play for them.

Mrs. Elton is pointedly described as being the daughter of a "Bristol&mdash;merchant". This was an implication that her &pound;10,000 fortune was dirty money because Bristol was an infamous slave port. (It's also why Mrs. Elton is keen to point out her in-laws' abolitionist views later.) To contemporary readers, it was another indication of how Mr. Elton cared about money and nothing else in his marriage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a>: We read a lot about a few characters we never get to meet firsthand.<ul><li> Frank's aunt and uncle, the very rich and snobby Churchills. Mr Churchill is supposed to be rather meek, but he's influenced by his wife. She's said to be domineering and unreasonable. For some time they stay in London and Richmond, which allows Frank to be close enough to Highbury to visit there quite often, but his aunt and uncle never come to Highbury themselves.</li><li> Jane Fairfax's foster family, the Campbells. Colonel and Mrs Campbell and their daughter Mrs Dixon and son-in-law Mr Dixon are talked about often enough, but never seen in person. They live in London and later go on an extended visit to Mr and Mrs Dixon in Ireland. Emma correctly suspects Jane has some ulterior motive to stay in Highbury instead, but she's mistaken about what the motive actually is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jane is in Highbury because that way, she might occasionally be in company of Frank who is secretly her fianc&eacute;.</span></li><li> Mrs Elton's sister and brother-in-law, the Sucklings.

He wants to marry well and knows he can, being a man with a respectable position and good income as a parson, and also quite good-looking. He sets his eyes on Emma, the richest young lady of the neighbourhood, who puts a spanner in his plans as soon as she realizes what he's doing. She even thinks to herself that her money is what he really wanted, and that he'd find someone else with a decent fortune soon enough.

The argument is that Mr Elton would have corrected his wife at the first opportunity after her misusing the phrase, and that she would have been too embarrassed to use the correct pronunciation. New editions usually use the correct spelling.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">Green-Eyed Epiphany</a>:<ul><li> Emma realizes she loves none but Mr Knightley when she hears that Harriet is in love with him and thinks he returns her affection.</li><li> Mr Knightley seems to have realized he really loves Emma after Frank Churchill's arrival and after his observation of their assumed flirtation, courtship and progressing relationship.

Everybody likes him except Mr Knightley.

The narrator says she has fallen 'little short of a mother in affection' and that she was less a governess than a friend. She's like another beloved daughter to Mr Woodhouse and something between a sister, mother and close friend to Emma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a>: Mrs Elton says she much prefers old-fashioned politeness to "modern ease", even though her own manners go far beyond ease and well into over-familiarity.

The narrative even notes that John's honestly very fond of his father-in-law, but there's only so long he can put up with some of Mr Woodhouse's more irritating dialogue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a>: Nearly everyone calls everyone else by their surname, with few exceptions among family and intimate friends, but even there there are some exceptions and the relationship is uneven.

He's a son of her close family friend, but he has been adopted by his wealthier childless relatives, so they have never met in person. Emma thinks (not without reason) that their match is considered "proper" by others in Highbury, as they are socially equal and close in age, and both are intelligent, charming and good-looking.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">Love Dodecahedron</a>: Emma ships Harriet and Mr Elton, even though Mr Elton wants to marry Emma and there is mutual attraction between Harriet and Robert Martin.

Mr Knightley is right to be very angry at Emma for persuading Harriet to refuse him. What is worse that Harriet actually likes Robert as well and was a close friend to his two sisters. The whole family feel very much Robert's pain and whenever Harriet meets them, she is uneasy and suffers too.</li><li> Harriet suffers because Emma talks her out of accepting Mr Martin's offer. She then talks her into falling in love with Mr Elton, and then she suffers because of this unrequited love because Mr Elton doesn't care for her.</li><li> Jane Fairfax becomes literally ill from all her love troubles. She's secretly engaged to a man she loves, but he doesn't understand that it's mentally draining to be dishonest to everyone.

At least she realises this late in the novel.</li><li> Frank Churchill. Flirting with Emma in front of his fianc&eacute;e, who has to keep their relationship hidden and play off the offers of a position of a Governess while waiting for him. He has no way of knowing how seriously - or not - Emma takes his flirting, but knows perfectly well how much it must be hurting Jane. Unlike Emma (likely in part because we never see inside his head), he doesn't redeem himself much by the end of the novel, though his letter to Mrs Weston does show some of his thoughts and his regret.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">Massive Numbered Siblings</a>: John and Isabella's five children, in stark contrast to the two Woodhouse sisters and two Knightley brothers.

To her, it's trying to perceive other people's hearts, and she thinks she knows what's best for everybody else. Her only known success story is bringing together the Westons, and it's never really confirmed just how much she was really responsible for that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush">Matchmaker Crush</a>: The result of Emma's matchmaking of Mr Elton and Harriet is Mr Elton falling for Emma.

He's a gentleman through and through and behaves like a knight to everybody - his family, friends and tenants. For example, he's very concerned for Mrs and Miss Bates, and Miss Fairfax, who are genteel but impoverished.</li><li> The name Woodhouse suggests that the family is very wealthy. Additionally, it was also the surname of a Royalist general, Sir Michael Woodhouse, signifying her as the prime example of the British aristocracy.</li><li> Jane Fairfax is a Jane with a fair face. In contrast to Emma, her surname is the same as a famous English Civil War general - adding another dimension to their tense relationship. Like Emma however, it places her as an ideal English woman.</li><li> Harriet's surname is "Smith" - like Emma and Jane she is very English, but in contrast to them, almost anonymous (Smith being the most common surname in England). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This makes a lot of sense near the end of the book, when it's revealed that she's the illegitimate daughter of a tradesman who wanted to basically remain anonymous in her life.</span></li><li> Everything is <strong>don</strong>e <strong>well</strong> in Donwell Abbey, Mr Knightley's estate.</li><li> Hartfield is a place where affairs of the heart are being formed.

He also helped James's daughter Hannah get a good job with the Westons prior to the beginning of the book, and remarks that she's "a pretty, well-spoken girl". It's also mentioned that Emma has invited the girl to her sewing parties. At one point, Emma even goes to visit a former servant who has retired. By contrast, Mrs Elton can't even remember her (presumably far fewer) servants' names.</li><li> Mr Knightley is very much respected by his servants and tenants.

Contrast with Mr Weston, who has no inherited wealth but is much more likeable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emma is oblivious to Mr Knightley's feelings for her, and her own feelings for him, until (she believes) it might be too late.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a>: Emma and Harriet. Emma is a gentleman's daughter and the first lady of the neighbourhood. She befriends Harriet, who was born out of wedlock so her position in society is questionable. Emma eventually realizes that her friendship with Harriet has only made Harriet's life more complicated and difficult than it needed to be, and by the end she resolves to draw back slightly and allow Harriet to make her own decisions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid">Old Maid</a>:<ul><li> Miss Bates never married, and there's no indication that there was ever anyone she might have married.</li><li> Discussed when Emma talks about her intention of never getting married. Harriet thinks it is a dreadful thing to be an old maid like Miss Bates, but Emma argues that a rich single woman of consequence can command as much respect as anybody, and be as pleasant and sensible as anybody else. She thinks she has an active mind and will always have something to occupy herself with, and her sister has five children, so she will have people to love later in her life as well without having to get married.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>:<ul><li> Mr Knightley. He's a sharp observer and can analyse the relationships most accurately. He's also the most sensible and not as obsessed with class status.</li><li> Mrs Weston is very intelligent, useful and gentle, and she sees things as a reasonable woman. However, she's sometimes blinded by her affection for Emma or Frank.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDialogueTwoConversations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDialogueTwoConversations">One Dialogue, Two Conversations</a>:<ul><li> At the end of Frank's first visit to Hartfield, he winds up alone with Emma and hesitantly begins to speak of the suspicions he's sure she has formed of his behavior. She ends the conversation rather than allow him to betray whatever secret he's ready to spill, so she never finds out what he was really going to say. She <em>thinks</em> he was going to confess that he's love with her; what he was really preparing to do was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tell her about his secret engagement</span>.</li><li> Emma and Harriet discuss the man with whom Harriet has fallen in love after he gallantly came to her rescue, but each is thinking of a different man. Harriet is talking of Mr Knightley, who asked her to dance after she was snubbed at the ball by the Eltons, but Emma thinks they are talking of Frank Churchill, who rescued Harriet from a band of gypsies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb">Person as Verb</a>: Jane Fairfax-ing. Mrs Elton thinks she's the only person who can judge Miss Fairfax's talents properly, and protect her and assist her. Mrs Elton's constantly repeating her name and the vulgarity of the situation disgust Emma so that she imagines this to be person-ing:<div class="indent"> <strong>Emma:</strong>: 'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose that she dares go about Emma Woodhouse-ing me!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PicnicEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PicnicEpisode">Picnic Episode</a>: The book has two Picnic Chapters:<ul><li> The strawberry picking party at Donwell gardens. They eat fruit outside, but Mr Knightley specifically arranges for proper meal to be eaten inside the house.</li><li> The summer trip to explore Box Hill. The day is too hot and Emma is at her worst when influenced by Frank; she carelessly insults Miss Bates.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick">Playing Sick</a>:<ul><li> Many characters presume that Frank's aunt is pretending to be ill to manipulate her husband and nephew (basically her adopted son). One of her manipulations is to keep Frank at home as much as possible. Frank later says she is really ill but plays up her symptoms. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then she dies.</span></li><li> Emma's father. It's hinted that the majority of the neighbourhood thinks he's a hypochondriac, but he's so kind-hearted and generous that they humour him. It's known that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he died two years after Emma married Mr Knightley</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>:<ul><li> Especially in the riddle poem fiasco. Had the writer indicated clearly for whom and by whom it was written, much embarrassment could have been avoided.</li><li> Emma misunderstands Harriet's feelings when she talks about the man with whom she is in love. Emma is resolved not to actively meddle, so they agree not to say his name. Trouble is, she was "rescued" twice and two gentlemen rendered her service.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticallyDifferentGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticallyDifferentGenerations">Practically Different Generations</a>: Frank Churchill is Mr Weston's son from his first marriage. Anna, Mr Weston's baby daughter from his second marriage, is born in the latter third of the novel, at which point Frank is stated to be 23 years old.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreppyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreppyName">Preppy Name</a>: The early 19th century equivalent. "Augusta" Elton is named after the mother and daughter of King George III, and her sister "Selina" is named after after Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. As the daughters of a Bristol merchant, these are pretentious names which demonstrate their own snobbish natures.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOverlookedParamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOverlookedParamour">Previously Overlooked Paramour</a>: Near the end of the novel, Emma realizes that she is in love with Mr. Knightley, her father's best friend, who had been like an uncle to her when she was growing up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedMarriageProposal">Rejected Marriage Proposal</a>:<ul><li> Emma persuades her friend Harriet to reject a marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a gentleman farmer, even though Harriet is clearly fond of him. It's because Emma is convinced Harriet should marry someone with better social standing and that she's a better match with Mr Elton, a local clergyman.</li><li> Mr Elton then proposes marriage to <em>Emma</em>, believing her to be in love with him; Emma is offended and declines, explaining she thought he was interested in Harriet. Mr Elton dismisses Harriet as being beneath him, upsetting Harriet and leaving Emma ashamed at her misjudgment of the situation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a>: Emma believes Harriet has fallen for Frank Churchill after he had rescued her from the gypsies, but instead she falls for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Mr Knightley</em> after <em>he</em> "rescues" her at the ball by asking her to dance when she is snubbed by Mr Elton.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">Rewatch Bonus</a>: Reread Bonus. It's a lot easier to pick up on the clues regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frank and Jane's secret engagement</span> on a second reading. It's also easier to see through the entire riddle poem mess the second time around, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">catch the hints that Mr Knightley is in love with Emma</span>. Paying attention to Miss Bates and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">Wall of Text</a> clues is also easier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>:<ul><li> The main character is a subversion in that she is in the position to behave like one, but is actually a really good person who uses her wealth and power reasonably. Moments when she does come across badly generally aren't a result of her upbringing or wealth, but rather her thoughtlessness and naivety. Some actresses play her as being much more snobby than she ever was in the book.</li><li> Mrs Elton, on the other hand, plays it straight and ratchets the trope right <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. She constantly boasts about her gowns, house, carriage, wealthy relatives, and so on. And she snubs people who are of the same, if not higher, position in the society, but to whom she fancies herself superior. For example, she remarks to Emma how surprised she was to find Mrs Weston ladylike - Mrs Weston, who is married to one of the most respectable men in Highbury and who was Miss Woodhouse's governess and is her close friend.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguishRomani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguishRomani">Roguish Romani</a>: Frank rescues Harriet from a band of gypsies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRain">Romantic Rain</a>:<ul><li> Poked fun at the beginning of the novel. Emma recollects that when Miss Taylor and she met Mr Weston in Broadway Lane, it began to drizzle, and he went away to borrow two umbrellas for them from Farmer Mitchell&#146;s, and she began to plan a match between them from that moment. Some illustrations have Mr Weston and Miss Taylor sharing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UmbrellaOfTogetherness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UmbrellaOfTogetherness">Umbrella of Togetherness</a>. Moreover, it's raining on their wedding day.</li><li> Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">Love Hurts</a> when Mr Martin, still hopelessly in love with Harriet who refused him, accidentally meets her at Ford's while it's raining. He advises her to take a better road that is less floated with water.</li><li> Mr Knightley rides on horseback from London to Highbury in the rain because he has been informed of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax's engagement</span>, and he fears that the news is distressing to Emma. He rides rain or no rain in order to soothe and counsel her. Downplayed because when Emma and Mr Knightley meet, the rain is gone, and despite his deep love, Mr Knightley is reasonable enough to go to his own estate first, have dinner and change to dry clothes.<div class="indent"><em>He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.</em></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSabotage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSabotage">Relationship Sabotage</a>: Emma actively meddles in Harriet and Robert Martin's relationship. Robert Martin asks Harriet to marry him, and it's clear that Harriet feels some affection for him as well, but Emma thinks Harriet should marry someone more genteel and persuades her to refuse him (and in such a way that Harriet doesn't realize that she's being manipulated).

Only the first one works out. (In the 2009 adaptation, Emma also ships John and Isabella and claims credit for their match.)</li><li> People in town ship Mr Knightley and Jane Fairfax. Mrs Weston mentions it first to Emma, and Mr Knightley, very much annoyed, hears the gossip from Mr Cole. Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's desperately in love with Emma.</span></li><li> Many people - most notably Mr and Mrs Weston - seem to ship Emma and Frank, who are both of nearly the same age, both are handsome and rich. Emma is like a daughter to Mrs Weston and Frank Churchill is Mr Weston's son.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingTorpedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingTorpedo">Shipping Torpedo</a>:<ul><li> Emma is displeased when she finds out that her proteg&eacute;e Harriet considers marrying Mr Martin, a young farmer. She talks Harriet out of accepting his offer.</li><li> Most people think that Emma and Frank Churchill belong together. The only one who thinks that Frank doesn't deserve her is Mr Knightley.</li><li> People in town start shipping Mr Knightley and Jane Fairfax. Emma is very much against their marriage and thinks it's only because her small nephew might not stay Mr Knightley's heir. (She realizes she actually loves Mr Knightley herself later.) Mr Knightley is also displeased when he hears the gossip and torpedoes it himself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallTownBoredom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallTownBoredom">Small Town Boredom</a>:<ul><li> Downplayed with Emma's feeling about Highbury, her home village in Surry. She enjoys being the first lady in the Highbury society, but considers others to be rather inferior (with the exception of Mr and Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley). When Emma meets Frank Churchill, he speaks of Highbury so handsomely that Emma begins "to feel she has been used to despise the place rather too much". Emma's desire to travel is hinted at, e.g. when she jokingly complains that she's the only one who has never seen the sea.<div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;&#151;I who have never seen it!</div></li><li> Frank Churchill grew up in a secluded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a> and once he's adult, he's travelling in England (e.g. he visits Weymouth, a popular spa town) and he has a great desire to travel abroad.<div class="indent"><strong>Frank:</strong> As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad. I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at&#151;or my tour to read&#151;or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself. <br><strong>Emma:</strong> That may be&#151;but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland.

Emma Woodhouse plays the piano rather well, but she hasn't practised enough to reach true mastery. Jane Fairfax is as old as Emma, and just as talented in music as she is, but Jane has a deeper love for music and she has been a diligent student and plays just about perfectly. Emma is a skilled performer, but Jane is <em>both</em> a technician <em>and</em> a performer. Of course, not everybody recognizes it.<div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like hers, than a lamp is like sunshine.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Oh! dear &#151; I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax&#146;s is much beyond it.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing. There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to teach.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a>: Mr Woodhouse is really fond of thin water gruel, as is his daughter Isabella.

What is interesting is that her gossip is harmless and often provides valuable insight, which other characters miss because they think she's just a batty old woman and they're used to tuning her out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes">What Beautiful Eyes!</a>:<ul><li> Harriet's soft blue eyes. Emma finds them particularly intriguing.</li><li> Mrs Weston gushes about Emma's loveliness and her sparkling bright hazel eyes.</li><li> Jane Fairfax's deep grey eyes with dark eyelashes are acknowledged as very beautiful.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> Mr Knightley likes finding mistakes in Emma and he's not above teasing her and scolding her. Two instances when it gets serious stand out:<ul><li> He instantly recognizes Emma's manipulation of Harriet when she talked her out of marrying Robert Martin. He tells her she's unreasonable and foolish, and that both Robert and Harriet will suffer because of her.</li><li> He tells Emma off when she carelessly insults Miss Bates. Jane Austen's fandom loves to use his "it was badly done" as his catchphrase, though he says it only once.<div class="indent"> <strong>Mr Knightley:</strong> Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?</div></li></ul></li><li> Implied with Jane's reaction to Frank when she sees him openly flirting with Emma right in front of her. It was a part of their plan (or rather just Frank's) to keep their relationship secret, but he takes it too far. It almost leads to the end of their engagement.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>: Subtly done with Emma. She encourages Harriet in her reading of <em>The Romance of the Forest</em>, a Gothic novel by Ann Radcliffe, which stars a girl of obscure origins who is ultimately revealed to be nobly born. Emma clearly thinks Harriet belongs in a similar story, when in actuality <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harriet is the natural daughter of a tradesman, who leaves her quite comfortably off economically but does nothing to raise her social status</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst">Wrong Guy First</a>: Emma thinks she's in love with Frank Churchill, but when she discovers her true feelings for another, she realises she never really loved Frank. Meanwhile, she persuades Harriet that her first love wasn't good enough for her, so Harriet sets her sights on various unattainable men before gratefully accepting her first love's proposal again.</li></ul>
