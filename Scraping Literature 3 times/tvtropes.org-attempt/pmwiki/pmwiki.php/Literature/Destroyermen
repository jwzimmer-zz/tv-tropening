The series centers around the crew of USS <em>Walker</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> destroyer who are catapulted to an alternate world after <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Java_Sea">a disastrous Allied defeat<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at Java. The new world is right out of prehistory: dinosaurs roam the lands, and the oceans are home to swarms of man-eating fish and giant reptiles. They've also gone from one war to another, for here two very different species have just started up a fight for survival again after several thousand years. On the one side are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Lemurians</a> (or 'Cats, as the Americans call them), lemur-like sea-goers who have lived a rather peaceful existence until now. On the other side are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">Grik</a>, savage raptor-like creatures hell-bent on hunting the 'Cats to extinction.</p><p><em>Walker</em> and her crew side with the Lemurians and join the struggle against the Grik.

Captain Reddy is the most obvious one, but Keje and Nakja-Mur also qualify, as do a solid majority of the Alliance heroes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a>: Invoked. Reddy is initially reluctant to involve his crew in the Grik-Lemurian conflict, but eventually decides it's the right thing to do (and that <em>Walker</em> realistically won't be able to survive in the alternate world without help). While the modern technology does give them an edge in the war against the Grik, some Lemurians express disappointment that they can probably never return to their old way of life due to the heavy industrialization required.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">Aliens Speaking English</a>:<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The Grik use written English as their "scientific tongue", having copied it from the East Indiamen they captured centuries ago. They don't actually speak it, mostly because they don't have the lips necessary to pronounce a lot of the sounds (though the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sa'aarans and Khonashi</span> manage a passable imitation).</li><li> Once Baalkpan begins to ramp up its war production, Nakja-Mur orders all of its citizens to learn English. Not out of favoritism for the Americans, as some accuse, but because the Lemurians don't <em>have</em> words for a lot of the technology they have to use and construct.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a>: The Grand Alliance of all Allied powers united beneath (or beside) the Banner of the Trees. Originally formed out of necessity by the Lemurian Homes (floating nation-states) and the "American Clan" (i.e. the destroyermen), it is later joined by land-based nations such as Baalkpan, the Fil-Pin Isles, and B'mbaado. After some time, new allies are found such as the Empire of New Britain, the Shogunate of Yokohama, the Republic of Real People, and a number of Grik-like peoples.<ul><li> In <em>Deadly Shores</em>, delegates from Alliance members lay the foundation for a single united nation, called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">United Homes</a>. Not all member nations join, but most of the Lemurian ones do.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: The Grik initially come off this way, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">Horde</a> that attacks in swarms with seemingly no regard for self-preservation. Gradually subverted as many of their Hij begin to grow into characters in their own right, some of them even defecting to the Alliance or at least becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponents</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base Are Belong to Us</a>:<ul><li> "Maelstrom" features <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Amagi</em> and the Grik attacking Baalkpan in by far the most epic battle in the entire series</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Dominion invades the New Britain Isles</span> in "Rising Tides".</li><li> And in "Deadly Shores", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Walker</em> herself is boarded by the Grik after getting stuck on a sandbar, and only a desperate defense combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue">timely air support</a> prevents her from being overrun</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlohaHawaii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlohaHawaii">Aloha, Hawaii!</a>: Yep, <em>Rising Tides</em> features USS <em>Walker</em> and crew heading to Hawaii. Only it's a little different...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>:<ul><li> The Lemurian world is an alternate <em>pre</em>history. The K-T extinction event that killed the dinosaurs in our universe didn't happen there, and the dinosaurs and their contemporaries have continued to evolve as a result. Indiginous humans don't seem to exist, but the Grik and Lemurians evolved independantly in Africa and on Madagascar, respectively.</li><li> A number of other alternate histories have begun to bleed into the series via other Squalls; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a> below.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>: Lord Koratin treats his addiction to power in a way somewhat analogous to alcoholism, believing that being given any real power will only see him try for more and destroy all in his path getting it. Thus he refuses to accept any official rank beyond Sergeant Major, though ironically, since he's Sister Audrey's primary advisor/bodyguard, in practical terms he really does hold quite a lot of power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanAccents">American Accents</a>: The destroyermen tend to be from all over the US, including California, Oklahoma, Chicago, Brooklyn, and various parts of the South. The audiobook's reader tries to do them justice, such as Matthew Reddy's Texas drawl. This becomes a plot point in <em>Storm Surge</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fred Reynolds is convinced that the man who rescued him is an Imperial spy based on his British-like accent; later, the man reveals that he is descended from other Americans who crossed over during the Mexican-American War and, thus, has an accent closer to the modern British one</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay">America Saves the Day</a>: Yup, it happens... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">in every single book</a>...sort of. The Americans are no stranger to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>, but the 'Cats aren't exactly helpless, either. Most of the "saving" is done indirectly, too: the Americans <em>cannot</em> do the lion's share themselves, so they work <em>with</em> the 'Cats as much as lead the effort. It's also made <em>very</em> clear Matt and his crew wouldn't stand a chance if the 'Cats weren't helping <em>them</em> out, too.<ul><li> An interesting case in <em>Storm Surge</em>, when a spy gives Fred Reynolds crucial intelligence about Dominion forces. The spy turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">American, descended from the crew of three US ships who crossed over in the 19th century and formed a new United States in this world</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible">And That's Terrible</a>: Any time the Dominion is brought up, either a character or the text will make a point of saying how it's a "dark perversion" of actual Catholicism.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>:<ul><li> So far, we've seen a lot of characters get buried at sea. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Dowden</a> proved that Anderson isn't messing around. Same with Nakja-Mur.</span></li><li> However, Taylor Anderson already confirmed certain primary characters can <em>not</em> be killed off due to plot reasons, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chack Sab-At or Captain Reddy</span>. Whether or not this information is accurate remains to be seen, but it is unlikely some characters will be biting the dust.</li><li> Subverted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tony Scott, whom everyone presumes dead for about 2 years until he turns up in <em>Storm Surge</em></span>.</li><li> Played straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fitzhugh Gray, who throws Matthew clear when a tide of Grik is about to overrun <em>Walker</em>'s top deck in <em>Deadly Shores</em></span>.

Taylor Anderson goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">great lengths</a> to make the altEarth ecology plausible. There are some (not too many) convenient plot devices, but even these don't seem unrealistic, and none of them are <span style="display:none">invoked</span><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">too</a></em> convenient.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseShips">Artistic License &#150; Ships</a>: None of the ships that cross to the alternate Earth actually fought in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. This was intentional: Anderson didn't want to disrespect any actual sailors who did.<ul><li> As explained in the afterword to the first book, the HIMS <em>Amagi</em> depicted was badly damaged by an earthquake while under construction and scrapped in 1922. (There <em>was</em> an <em>Amagi</em> that served in WWII, but <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Amagi">she was a carrier<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.) The real USS <em>Walker</em> was scuttled seventeen days after Pearl Harbor, while USS <em>Mahan</em> was scrapped in 1931.<ul><li> Many <em>Wickes</em> class destroyers saw action throughout WWII. USS <em>Ward</em>, the ship that fired the first shots at Pearl Harbor, was a sister ship of <em>Mahan</em> and <em>Walker</em>.</li><li> In-universe, HIMS <em>Amagi</em> was completed as planned, except with her main battery being downgraded to 10-inch guns, likely to exploit some loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, there were only 19 destroyers of that class, although three ships were also listed on the roster but served as the dummy budget for <em>Yamato</em>-class battleships.

However, there is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> ship matching the name and the time period.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, the French considered finishing her under the name <em>Savoie</em> but ultimately scrapped her. <em>Savoie</em>'s description in the book matches the post-refit design of the <em>Lorraine</em>.</li><li> The Nazi submarine <em>U-112</em> is stated to be a Type XIB.

In the real world, 5 ships of the class were originally planned while only 3 were built with the other 2 being canceled (of the two that were canceled, one of them was to be christened <em>Leopardo</em> with the most likely candidate being the fifth and final ship of the class). Of course, Anderson's <em>Leopardo</em> is from the Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration &Eacute;tats Souverains's universe, so the real-world history of the class need not apply. However, this once again shows that Anderson actually does the research rather then just shoehorning it in for convenience.</li><li> Ditto for <em>Ramb V</em>, introduced in <em>Winds of Wrath</em>. Only four RAMB refrigerator ships were produced on our world (they ended up being converted into troop ships, auxiliary cruisers, and hospital ships when the war came). Presumably, the fascist Italy of that world build at least one more.</li><li> Same for the Lyon-class battleship <em>Tourville</em>. The Lyon-class battleship was never built in real life. Four were planned but all were canceled once World War I broke out. It's even mentioned in the book the Lyon-class was never built in the real world.

Taylor Anderson is a professional gunsmith, and includes plenty of toys for firearms enthusiasts in <em>Walker</em>'s small arms locker. All of the officers and chiefs, as well as Sergeant Alden and several seamen, carry M1911 pistols. Gunner's Mate Dennis Silva proves that the M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle is an excellent tool for solving interpersonal problems. After seeing what lurks beneath the surface, Coxswain Tony Scott won't go near the water without his M1928A1 Tommy Gun locked and loaded. Springfield M1903 rifles are frequently used. An inventory of the small arms locker in <em>Into The Storm</em> even turns up several crates of obsolete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">M1895 Krag-Jorgenson rifles and their .30-40 ammo</a>, which Chief Gray figures probably came with the ship when she was new.

Rather than devote too much effort on the very complex and high-quality M1928A1 Tommy Gun, they come up with the Blitzer Bug: a crude blowback-operated .45 SMG that accepts Thompson magazines. It's apparently something like the bastard offspring of an M3 Grease Gun and a British Sten gun.

They particularly want to kill the Lemurians because the Lemurians are the only "prey" to have ever escaped them.</li><li> The fourth book has Billingsly, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Politically Incorrect Villain</a> who views Lemurians as a lesser species of "ape-men" and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">orders the captain of HIMS <em>Ajax</em> to destroy two Lemurian ships because they dared to speak to him, moreso because it was a female Lemurian</span>.</li><li> The Dominion considers Lemurians to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink">intelligent animals</a> at best, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbomination">demons</a> at worst.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>:<ul><li> "Rising Tides". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Walker</em> reaches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">New Britain Isles</a> (Hawaii) and helps them fight off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">Dominion</a> invasion, earning a powerful new member of the Alliance but also opening up a second front in the war.

Even then some things are treated as more valuable than gold: when Silva and "Moe" (an old Lemurian hunter) find a downed Japanese bomber, Moe rejoices, claiming that he'll be the richest Lemurian ever from all the aluminum that makes up the plane.
