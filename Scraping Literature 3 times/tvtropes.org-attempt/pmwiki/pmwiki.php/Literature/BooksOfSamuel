Absalom's death was so heartbreaking to David that his mourning made his own troops retreat from the battle in shame.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a>: David had a habit of fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">civil wars</a> against his own family members, so he often engages in this trope.<ul><li> When Saul and Jonathan (David&#146;s father- and brother-in-law) are killed in battle, David writes a song of lamentation for both of them. While Jonathan had long been David&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartner">Heterosexual Life-Partner</a>, Saul had tried to kill David on several occasions.

Michal was then brought to David with her second husband following behind crying, until he was told to return home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome">Amulet of Concentrated Awesome</a>: The ark of God is treated as this in these books. In 1st Samuel, when the Israelites were first defeated by the Philistines, they realize that if they could carry the ark of God into battle, God would have to fight for them and wipe out their enemies. As it turns out, though, God not only lets the Israelites be defeated by the Philistines again, He also allows the ark to be taken into Philistine territory, where it causes trouble among their people until they decide to have it be brought back to the Israelites by putting it on a cart driven by oxen alongside a trespass offering and have the oxen take it away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>:<ul><li> Goliath is wearing more than a hundred pounds of armor, including a bronze helmet.

To demonstrate this point, Samuel calls for rain in the summer season, when it is least likely to rain. The subsequent thunder and rain greatly frightens the people of Israel, who ask Samuel to intercede for them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a>: God was so pleased at Hannah giving her firstborn to His service after years of infertility that He made her quite fertile from that point on. She proceeds to have five more children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>: In 2nd Samuel chapter 5, when David and his men set their sights on conquering Jersualem, the Jebusites resist with a boast that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">even the blind and the lame will turn you away</a>.&#148; This didn't work for the Jebusites, as David and his men succeeded in conquering the city, and as a curse, "the blind and the lame" are not allowed to enter into God's house &mdash; a curse that endured into the day of Jesus' earthly ministry and that of the early church.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a>: 2nd Samuel has a <em>list</em> of Badasses who worked for King David, and were referred to as the "Mighty Men". The list is filled with stories of people killing off hundreds of people singlehanded, or fighting wild animals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli">Badass Israeli</a>: A whole lot of them, probably most notably David and his mighty men. Saul was no wimp either.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadNewsInAGoodWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadNewsInAGoodWay">Bad News in a Good Way</a>: When King David asks a Cushite officer announcing his victory over Absalom whether Absalom is still alive, the Cushite rather tactfully replies that he hopes <em>all</em> of King David's enemies end up sharing that young fellow's fate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy">Bastard Understudy</a>: How Saul comes to view David, as the Lord has departed from Saul and His Spirit is now resting on David to give him success in battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: The people of Israel ask Samuel for a king, believing this will bring greater stability to Israel. Samuel warns them about how oppressive kings can be, but they ignore his warning. The truth of Samuel&#146;s warnings, though, isn&#146;t apparent until a few kings later.<div class="indent"><strong>Rehoboam</strong>: &#147;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.&#148; &#150; 1 Kings 12:14</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByOffspring">Betrayal by Offspring</a>: David's son, Absalom, turns against his father and seizes Jerusalem driving David beyond the Jordan River. Absalom then rules for a time as a regent and self-declared king before being slain by his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>, Joab, in the Battle of Ephraim Wood. Despite Absalom's revolt against him, David <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistInMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistInMourning">weeps over his death</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterThanSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterThanSex">Better Than Sex</a>: In the Song of the Bow from 2nd Samuel chapter 1, David says Jonathan's love for him surpassed that of the love of women.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">Better to Die than Be Killed</a>: Saul chooses to kill himself rather than let the Philistines capture him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>: The families of David and his mighty men, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">including David&#146;s wives, Abigail and Ahinoam</a>, were kidnapped by the Amalekites. David&#146;s men nearly stoned him in their anguish, but after David prayed to the LORD, he led to his men to reclaim their lost families and property.<div class="indent"> &#147;Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken. David brought back all.&#148; &mdash; 1 Samuel 30:19 (English Standard Version)</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a>: David&#146;s family! Amnon rapes his half-sister, Absalom kills Amnon and then plots sedition against his father, Adonijah plots to take over the kingdom when David was near death and no successor was officially named, and most of David's other sons just go along with the whole thing like it's no big deal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition">Birth/Death Juxtaposition</a>: Soon after Phinehas and Hophni get killed in 1st Samuel chapter 5, Phinehas' widow gives birth to his son Ichabod even as she passes away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass">Bodyguarding a Badass</a>: King David had thirty elite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> soldiers to act as his personal bodyguards, but he's such a badass he probably didn't need them anyway. Although as David does get older, he had to be told to stay home in Jerusalem so that the "lamp of Israel" doesn't get snuffed out when he almost got killed in battle and one of his men came to his rescue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">Bowdlerize</a>: David's adulterous affair with Bathsheba and subsequent murder of her husband Uriah is downplayed in most retellings of the story for children as David wanting to marry Bathsheba, but after finding out that she is married to Uriah, orders for him to be killed in battle so that he could legally marry Bathsheba. The same accounts also downplay or leave out entirely David's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">multiple wives</a> before Bathsheba.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BratsWithSlingshots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BratsWithSlingshots">Brats with Slingshots</a>: Notably <em>not</em> David, though many, many people believe he used one. What he really used was a <em>sling</em>, a weapon that relied on built-up centrifugal force to propel a dense bullet at high speed against a target; it did not use elasticity to propel the projectile in any meaningful way. In ancient-world terms it was more like a difficult-to-aim gun than a kid's toy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Brother&#150;Sister Incest</a>: Actually, <em>half-brother</em> and <em>half-sister</em>, but Amnon's rape of Tamar qualifies. The attraction between them was only one way, as Amnon was more interested in Tamar than she was in him. Tamar tries to reason with Amnon by telling him to speak to King David about giving her to him as a wife, hoping that what he intended to do to her wouldn't happen, but Amnon was too much in the heat of passion to even care.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunkerWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunkerWoman">Bunker Woman</a>: David's unnamed ten concubines, who slept (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">very probably under duress</a>) with Absalom when he took over Jerusalem during his coup.

Unfortunately, this also leads to Absalom's seditious acts against his own father as he gathers support from most of Israel to have him be king instead of his father David.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller">Expecting Someone Taller</a>: In 1st Samuel, when it came the time for prophet Samuel to anoint the new king, God instructed him to go to a house of a certain Jesse who had many sons. He inspected them, and they were no doubt strong, smart, and reputable, but to the surprise of Jesse and probably Samuel too, none of them were to be the king.

Upon finding out his sons have been struck down in their arrogance, and that the ark of God had been taken, Eli's fat gets the better of them and he dies by falling onto his neck.

David confesses that he has sinned before the Lord, and Nathan tells David that he has been forgiven, though because David has been spared from death, the Lord will punish David for his deeds by having his firstborn son with Bathsheba die in his place.

Araunah was willing to give the threshing floor and the oxen and the wood free of charge to the king, but King David insists on buying the property, saying that he would not make sacrifices to the Lord with offerings that cost him nothing.

In this case the desire is genuine but he doesn't expect it to actually happen. But one of his best warriors overheard, gathered a few other mighty men together, and broke through enemy lines to bring back Bethlehem well water, and the King was appalled that anyone would actually risk his life for that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheDead">Robbing the Dead</a>: The Amalekite who came to David with Saul's royal crown and armband claiming to have killed him was almost certainly not being straight with David in other parts of his story as well as the part about killing Saul (who'd already committed suicide). For one thing, people don't just "happen" to be hanging around places where battles are taking place (like Mount Gilboa) as he claims to have been. For another, he must have gotten to Saul awfully <em>quickly</em> to have gotten his royal trappings before the Philistines found him. The likeliest explanation? He was a thief there to scavenge from the dead and just figured he'd found the biggest score of his career when he stumbled across Saul's remains.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a>: The sons of Eli, Samuel, and most of David&#146;s all fall into this category.

His army, however, refuses to let him do so, telling David to the effect that his life means much more to the people of Israel than the lives of his followers, and that losing him would mean a much greater loss than that of his followers, and so David acquiesces and stays behind in protective custody.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip">Shameful Strip</a>: In 2nd Samuel chapter 10, King Hanun of Ammon decided to embarrass King David's team of delegates by sending them back to their master with their garments cut off showing their buttocks, as well as half their beards forcibly shaven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Wedding</a>: Though passed off by David as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal">Honorable Marriage Proposal</a>; he married Bathsheba (after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">killing her husband off</a>) because he got her pregnant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentTreatment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentTreatment">Silent Treatment</a>: Amnon gets this from his half-brother Absalom after the rape of Tamar to express his total displeasure and to signal that things are going to go bad for Amnon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a>: Eli's sons Hophni and Phinehas, who not only took from the sacrifices the portions that were meant for God, but also slept with the women that assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

As a punishment, the son of that adultery dies, but later they have another son: Solomon. David is also cursed with war and public shame, which results in the deaths of two of his other sons.

This doesn't stop Saul from worshiping the Lord when he realizes that the kingdom of Israel would be torn away from his grasp and instead be given to another by the decree of God, but things really go downhill for Saul from there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckSessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckSessor">Sucksessor</a>:<ul><li> Eli's sons sucking leads the way for Samuel to become the priest<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3pnmv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3pnmv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3pnmv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and, to add in the irony, unlike Eli in Aaron's priestly line, Samuel descended from the infamous Korah</span>; then, Samuel's just-as-terrible sons lead the way to Saul being crowned.</li><li> Saul sees Jonathan as this, since Jonathan cares more about his friendship with David than the throne; but being the suck-sessor to a terrible king is hardly a bad thing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicallyBrokenObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicallyBrokenObject">Symbolically Broken Object</a>: Tamar's special robe, which was a symbol of her virginity, was torn by her after she had been violated by her half-brother Amnon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch">This Is for Emphasis, Bitch!</a>: Courtesy of King Saul, and the first recorded example in human history.<div class="indent">"You <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TactfulTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TactfulTranslation">son of a perverse, rebellious woman</a></strong>!

After Absalom dies and David is brought back to Jerusalem, he encounters Mephibosheth and asks why he didn't come with the king, and Mephibosheth answers that Ziba had deceived him while he was preparing to go with David. So in this case, Ziba was the Unreliable Narrator who lied to the king about Mephibosheth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualDysphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualDysphemism">Unusual Dysphemism</a>: In 1st Samuel chapter 25, King David uses the term "one who urinates against a wall" in reference to males that are considered worthy of slaughter, equating those men to dogs, when he is refused any help by Nabal in gratitude for protecting his flocks and servants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a>: Many English translations have Saul swear at Jonathan along the lines of, "You son of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch">perverse and rebellious woman</a></em>!" Needless to say, there is indeed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore">closer English equivalent</a> to the Hebrew original, but apparently most translators prefer to use an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TactfulTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TactfulTranslation">equally accurate but not so precise translation</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. (<em>The Living Bible</em> is a notable exception.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, but not in the same event. The Trope Maker is Saul sending David on missions to get him killed (unsuccessful), whereas the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is David's attempt to get a woman and conceal his guilt by sending her husband who is one of his own loyal soldiers to death in the hands of the enemy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">Villain Has a Point</a>: After Absalom's rebellion fails because, despite David's explicit orders he be spared, Joab kills the rebel, David becomes extremely sad and the story clearly expects us to feel sympathy for the man who just lost one of his sons. Joab goes to his uncle and tells him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">man up and behave like a king should</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuitYourWhining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuitYourWhining">stop crying like a child</a>, and criticizes him to his face how he constantly shows goodwill to people who try to harm him while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">showing no gratitude to those who faithfully serve him</a>. Not even the narrative denies that Joab, morally ambiguous as he is, has something of a point by now, especially since David does just what his nephew tells him afterwards.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>: Absalom becomes this when he returns home from his exile after having his half-brother Amnon killed. Setting himself as a judge of the people of Israel, Absalom purposely made his father David look bad by saying that he himself could provide better justice for the people than David can, and thus stole the hearts of all Israel, setting up for the moment when he would declare himself king and force David and his faithful men to flee to the mountains.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginityFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginityFlag">Virginity Flag</a>: After King David's daughter Tamar is raped by her half-brother Amnon, the poor girl tears her garment that was reserved for the King's virgin daughters. Her full brother Absolom immediately realizes what happened when he sees her, and it does NOT end well for Amnon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a>: David, giant slayer and great musician/poet/dancer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> Samuel chews out Saul for burning an offering without waiting for him to arrive to Gilgal and later for sparing King Agag and the cattle and sheep when God commanded him to kill all Amalekites.</li><li> Michal tries to do this with David and his supposed stripping dance before the Lord, but that just results in her never having any children.</li><li> Nathan reams out David for his adultery, and his murder of Uriah.</li><li> Joab gives one to David as well, for mourning over Absalom's death so much that he neglected to thank his men for their loyalty.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">What Measure Is a Mook?</a>: David has no problem killing Saul's soldiers in battle, but refuses to kill Saul himself, even when he gets the chance, since Saul is still considered God's anointed, and David could not kill God's anointed and be guiltless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude">What's Up, King Dude?</a>: Invoked by Absalom, who stood at the city gates of Jerusalem and met with all who came to Jerusalem who wanted to meet the king. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">He used this to gain favor with the people in preparation for his rebellion</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat">Who Will Bell the Cat?</a>: In 1st Samuel chapter 17, the Israelites are faced with the situation of who's going to take on Goliath's challenge of facing him man-to-man in combat, with King Saul promising a reward to the man who would succeed in defeating the giant. Enter a 17-year-old shepherd boy named David, armed with only a sling, a few stones, and faith in God that he can take down the giant just as he took down a bear and a lion. David's overwhelming victory against Goliath astounded even King Saul, who was wondering whose son he was of the families of Israel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince">The Wise Prince</a>: Prince Jonathan proves to be a wiser and more caring ruler than his father King Saul, and the earlier stories involving him tend to be optimistic...until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance">Tragic Bromance</a> with to-be-king David <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">kicks in</a>...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanLeaveYourHatOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanLeaveYourHatOn">You Can Leave Your Hat On</a>: When David and the Israelites are successful in bringing the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem, they break out into song, and David supposedly strips all the way down until he is wearing a linen ephod in worship to the Lord. Michal, one of David's wives, sees through a window David doing this, and ended up depising him in her heart, giving him a chewing out that accused him of debasing himself like a lewd person in front of the maidens. This doesn't go well for her, though, as Michal was cursed with never bearing children from that day forward.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Youngest Child Wins</a>: Of all Jesse's eight sons, the last of them, David, is the one chosen by God to be the one that would succeed Saul as king of Israel. This doesn't make his eldest brother Eliab all that happy, as in 1st Samuel chapter 17 he outrightly accuses David of coming down to the battlefield at the Valley of Elah just to see the spectacle of who will go up against Goliath.</li></ul><hr>
