Hemry). John "Black Jack" Geary of the Alliance Navy is escorting some merchant ships when the convoy is attacked in the first strike by the Syndicate Worlds, or Syndics. He fights a rear guard action, ejecting from his ship at the last moment, but the transmitter of the escape pod is broken, so he isn't found for nearly a century. When he's awakened, the fleet is preparing to use the enemy hypernet gate network, with a traitor-provided key, to strike at the Syndic home system. It goes wrong. He takes command of the fleet and must use his knowledge of forgotten tactics to save the fleet from certain destruction deep behind enemy lines. The attrition rate of ships and experienced personnel has forced the Alliance to cut down costs and production times and replace traditional officer training with a twisted code of honor that demands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">attacking the enemy head on</a>. The only good news, until Geary shows up, is that the Syndics have had to do the same. He also has to defend himself against the treachery and stupidity of dissenting captains, and keep his love interests from killing each other. Also, there seems to be a mysterious race of Aliens behind the ongoing war and the barely-understood technology of the hypernet gates.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Two follow on series continue the store of Captain Geary and the leaders of a particular planet.

The first novel <em>Vanguard</em> was released on May 16, 2017, and features a distant ancestor of John's named Robert Geary. The trilogy followed up with <em>Ascendant</em> and concluded in 2019 with <em>Triumphant</em>, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> bringing the events back to the main series. A comic book series, <em>Lost Fleet: Corsair</em>, staring Geary's grandnephew, Michael, was also announced.

The formations and tactics used by Geary are not simply 3 dimensional, but <em>4</em> dimensional. Time plays an incredibly decisive factor in winning a battle, especially since everything the commander sees is happening hours after it happened and everybody is moving fast enough that time dilation is a non-trivial issue.

The Alliance government made him this after his last stand to inspire the Alliance in the war.

He doesn't feel like this trope is in effect and that he is only human and flawed. However as everyone keeps reminding him he's pretty much pulled off the impossible several times. Senator Navarro summing up the first five books:<div class="indent"> " All right Captain Geary. You saved the Alliance fleet and the Alliance itself, you practically wiped out the Syndic fleet and established conditions favorable for forcing an end to the war, you've both discovered and neutralized a threat to all humanity, and you've established the real likelihood that a nonhuman intelligent species exists. Is there anything else?"</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead">Affectionate Gesture to the Head</a>: The "hug" that the Dancers perform, doing so with Rione after they first establish contact with humanity. Rione is noticeably uncomfortable with this, but so is the Dancer, as both humans and Dancers find each other hideous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienBlood">Alien Blood</a>: During a firefight between Marines and the Kicks, Geary notes that the Kicks are bleeding purplish blood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> as the reason why neither side will use artificial intelligence to pilot their ships. Not that it's happened yet but they are so scared of it happening.<ul><li> In <em>Steadfast</em>, this comes to the foreground of the series:</li><li> The book begins with Geary visiting Stonehenge but being more struck by a large ground combat vehicle rusting near it. A guide explains that it was a tank, one of several that were AI controlled and hacked by people who wanted to destroy Stonehenge. Only with significant bravery and loss of life were they stopped.</li><li> At the end of the book, they realize that a mysterious new 'dark fleet' that just indiscriminately attacked a Syndic and a neutral system and destroyed Alliance shipping has no organics in the debris of destroyed ships, strongly indicating they had no crew.</li><li> The dark fleet is programmed to fight like Geary, but doesn't have any real understanding of <em>why</em> Geary fights the way he does. This occasionally leads the fleet to do things which make sense for a human commander but not an AI commander like fall back to cover heavily damaged ships. Geary would do this to try to rescue what survivors he can; since the crippled dark fleet ship had no crew, this action served no purpose except to divert ships needed to pursue a primary objective for no gain.</li><li> Another problem with AI that is mentioned is that humans are capable of understanding that there are times to bend or break the rules, while machines can't. As such, at one point the Dark Fleet is forced to retreat from a battle it could have won because they were programmed with regulations which required that ships whose fuel reserves had dropped below a certain level return to base for resupply. If there positions had been reversed, Geary would have continued the engagement for the brief period of time needed to finish the battle, and <em>then</em> gone back for resupply. Even in later engagements, the best the Dark Fleet can do to get around that limit is to not redline their systems all the time so that they can last longer without running out of fuel.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>Leviathan</em> deals with the realization the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">A.I.s</a> controlling the dark fleet are very probably psychopathic. The Dancers also send ships to aid Geary in destroying the dark fleet, with the insinuation they faced a similar problem in their past and consider AI combatants as too dangerous to be allowed to exist.</span></li><li> On a lighter note, there is a quirk within the programming of the AI responsible for fleet assignments, resulting in situations where the commanding admirals of a region all having last names beginning with the letter "E" and ships being crewed by sailors with the same last name (at least until fleet command realized what was happening and stepped in to manually prevent this nonsense).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel">Aliens Never Invented the Wheel</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Dancers / spider-wolves never invented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuctTapeForEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuctTapeForEverything">duct tape</a> or any equivalent "universal fixing substance(s)."</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a>: A huge conglomeration of systems actually called the Alliance, and at least two other nations, the Rift Federation and the Callas Republic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Ambiguous Situation</a>: Michael, Geary's grandnephew, is forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> at the very beginning of the series. It's brought up over and over again over the following books that he might have survived and been taken prisoner, but that the odds would be against it.

For Free-Market countries, Total Wars rely on significant borrowing from banks and/or selling bonds in order to effectively use the combined savings of their people to pay for the ongoing costs of the war; while there's initially a large lump-sum to be taxed out of one's own people (the backlog of savings from years, decades, or even centuries in the past) after a certain point you only have the money that people are saving <em>right now</em> to take from them. If the government spends more money than it takes it <em>de facto</em> creates new money, which reduces the general value of the currency since there is more of it around. But while limiting military spending to sustainable levels could limit the inflation, this could cause your forces to lose the war. If unchecked then the inflation would eventually result in the general economy of the state breaking down into regional and/or local economies as the means by which things are bought are sold (the currency) becomes worthless and people resort to unofficial <em>ad hoc</em> measures. While you could replace the currency with a new one, the same thing would just happen all over again. This is exactly what happened in Russia in World War One, wherein the huge levels of internal dissent resulting from the Total War Economy caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">a military coup and then a Civil War</a>. Later in the same war Germany and Austria-Hungary also imploded in the same manner, and Germany and Japan were on the cusp of doing likewise at the end of WWII as well.<ul><li> It's even worse trying to think about logistics from the Syndicate side of things, which from the Lost Stars series highlights how incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient">inefficient</a> their entire economy was.

Plus the amount of corruption going on from higher ups that should've detracted from their war effort.

The first being that the author had learned from his previous works that too much jargon confused some of his readers - so was done for simplicity's sake. The second being that it represented the degradation of command structure in the Alliance, and the rising egotism of the officer class that put an emphasis on seniority of rank over merit.<ul><li> Turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, when Geary is promoted from Captain all the way to Fleet Admiral.

This makes some sense in the first series, where every officer of flag rank in the fleet is murdered in the first chapter, but this continues into the second series, when there was plenty of opportunities for the Alliance to appoint or promote people to squadron command.</li><li> On the other side of the fence, the Syndicate structure is also quite baffling. It seems that everyone in a position of power is named a CEO, with a person directly beneath CEO being named a sub-CEO, despite there existing a perfectly serviceable title of COO<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ghuh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ghuh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ghuh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Chief Operations Officer, who runs day-to-day operations and answers to the CEO</span> to tide them over.

This foils a Syndic commando team when they infiltrate it to blow it up, but due to their single and pair operation they are quickly overwhelmed by the effect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>:<ul><li> The fate of Captain Gundel, a lazy and obstructive officer Geary had 'transferred' to conduct a worthless study soon after Gear takes command. He isn't mentioned again until the fleet returns home, where the fleet leaves him behind in Alliance space (and he's still working on a study of the supplies the fleet will need to get back to Alliance space).</li><li> When they first see the Dancers and are digesting their unpleasant appearance, Charban remarks "at least they don't have tentacles."

That one is reserved for ancestral worship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier">The Brigadier</a>: Admiral Timbale becomes this, having most of the authority on Ambaru station but not much beyond that. He tries to help Geary as much as he can despite being a pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> authority figure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bullying a Dragon</a>: After the war, Geary is sent to a Syndic planet to recover Alliance prisoners of war, something the peace treaty between the two nations allows him to do. The Syndic CEO in charge of the planet tries to extort money out of Geary for services rendered for the POWs. Despite the fact that Geary's fleet numbers at over two-hundred ships while the CEO's isn't even in double digits and Geary's reputation for utterly dominating battles is VERY well known by this point. The CEO is banking on the fact that it is Geary himself making demands, and that Geary will be too honorable to do anything violent. This ends with a full ground assault by the marines and with Geary blowing up a dozen or two military installations near the POW camp. Needless to say, the CEO didn't gauge Geary very well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurialInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurialInSpace">Burial in Space</a>: Launched toward the sun.<ul><li> Also inverted as the penalty for traitors in the Navy: you get buried in jumpspace, never to come back to the stars. When Geary finds this out, he is reluctant to do this, as he doesn't want to consign anyone (even a traitor) to being cut off from his or her ancestors and the living stars. However, Desjani points out that this is merely symbolic to the living, as it's absurd to think that the ancestors and the living stars wouldn't be able to find someone in jump space.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantKillYouStillNeedYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantKillYouStillNeedYou">Can't Kill You, Still Need You</a>: Subverted (but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">Inverted</a>).

The fleet as a lot of these characters, but the <strong>main</strong> one is Desjani. Ironically, John Geary never was this, because he was '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">posthumously</a>' promoted to captain but immediately ascended to acting as Admiral.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>: several cases throughout the series, but Rione and Badaya are the biggest examples.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>: Geary's first big speech about not committing war crimes. It first serves a purpose in establishing Geary's attitudes about warfare and honor in relation to how far his society has come, so you may be forgiven for forgetting it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's later used as spontaneous evidence by Rione to convince the Grand Council of Geary's honor again.</span><ul><li> Geary notices the Fleet Cross ribbon on Desjani's uniform and wonders how she could've possibly earned such a highly distinguished award (which hadn't been given in decades in Geary's time). It comes up every now and again in the books, but the event is never fully explained until <em>Guardian</em>, in a very heartfelt scene.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestOfMedals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestOfMedals">Chest of Medals</a>:<ul><li> The Syndic War has been going for so long and is so violent that even the most junior sailors have several rows of medals indicating participation in numerous campaigns and for exceptional acts in battle. Geary is conspicuous by his lack of such decorations.</li><li> The forces of the Shield of Sol take this trope to such extremes that apparently low-ranking bridge officers have more medals than most veteran Alliance sailors, while the high-ranking officers take it to a degree that Geary and Desjani consider to be utterly ludicrous.

Due to certain prior incidents where sailors had been lost for years before their escape pods were found, the Alliance Navy added a regulation stating that time in survival sleep does not count towards the accumulation of pay, leave time, or completion of one's term of enlistment, so Geary's century of sleep does not entitle him to a king's ransom in back pay, several years paid vacation, and a retirement with full pension. Between that and the fact that the bank accounts in which he stored his pre-war savings having been long since emptied and closed, he's actually quite poor. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">the Navy forgot to add a clause in that reg about seniority in grade</a>, which is why Geary is the highest ranking officer in the fleet after the flag officers are all murdered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>: An initially justified tendency of Geary is to micromanage his ship and task force commanders. For good reason, he can't rely on them at first to properly execute his plans on their own. Later, once reliable and intelligent commanders are put in place he's still doing it and needs Rione to call him out when he nearly overwhelmed trying to direct a complex battle on his own instead of trusting his officers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>: Most of the power structure for the Syndics are these, to the point higher officers in their fleet are various ranks of CEO. Any executive with a hint of conscience of independent thought tends to get exiled to a backwater or assassinated, meaning the top ranks are filled with scheming, self-centered sociopaths.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">Covers Always Lie</a>: For some reason the publishers felt it necessary to put Geary in armor holding a BFG while posing in some exotic location even if such a scene has never appeared in any of the books to date. Heck, until <em>Victorious</em> he doesn't even leave the <em>Dauntless</em>, and then for a space station. It took until the <em>Beyond the Frontier</em> series for him to finally set foot on a planet &mdash; a friendly one, where the biggest danger was hordes of adoring fans, and that only got described in a flashback - he didn't set foot on a planet <em>during</em> a book until two novels later. Lampshaded in <em>Invincible</em>, when Geary and Desjani are talking about her writing a tell-all book about him if he dies and she jokes that it will have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">misleading cover</a> of him doing something he never did, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">wearing armor and striking a heroic pose with a gun.</a><ul><li> Averted on the British editions which actually had individual space ships hanging in space. Still a case of this, as the ships on those covers are blocky and rigid, where as the ships in the series are more smooth and sharklike.</li><li> The cover of <em>Steadfast</em> almost gets it right, since he did indeed stand in front of Stonehenge, but without the armor and gun depicted.</li><li> The <em>Leviathan</em> cover (which, incidently, is the current page image for the series) is surprisingly accurate, given the rest of the series. The Dancers' ovoid ships, along with sharklike Dark Ships and several Alliance Fleet vessels are present. However, one Dark Ship appears to be firing on another Dark Ship, everyone is far too visible for a series where combat usually takes place at decent fractions of the speed of light, and Geary is observing from a big bay window instead of the bridge buried deep in the hull.</li><li> Averted by the Chinese cover of <em>Fearless</em> as seen <a class="urllink" href="http://pre14.deviantart.net/1cc6/th/pre/i/2012/034/3/d/the_lost_fleet__fearless_by_sharksden-d3ivsmm.jpg">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.

When he exits, he has a couple of options for which jump point to take next, knowing that the overwhelming Syndic fleet is right behind him. What does he do? HE GOES BACK TO LAKOTA!</li><li> Geary's plan to 'charge' the missile swarm of a species just encountered (the missiles being <em>piloted</em> they're so massive), and tell ships to maneuver independently.</li><li> Realizing their formation is about to be destroyed by the enemy Armada, Captain (Jane) Geary takes command of all the Battleships in the group and has them charge the enemy. She desperately orders them to fire all the kinetic bombardment rounds they can, projectiles which are <em>never</em> used against ships because they're so easy to avoid...and the enemy doesn't avoid them, blowing a hole big enough in the enemy to get through.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteSuburb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteSuburb">Cut-and-Paste Suburb</a>: Well, Planet, actually.

When Geary asks for elaboration while musing to himself that they sound like a cute fairy tale creature, Colonel Caribali clarifies it as 'Human Portable Nuclear Munitions'- and though they allegedly have timers, the Alliance had them too and no one who trained with them, including the instructors, thought the timers were real. So basically, stealthed nuclear suicide bomber commandos.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Dead Guy Junior</a>: Not yet, but Desjani made Geary agree that should they ever have a daughter she be named after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jaylen Cresida</span>, who fell in the final battle getting the fleet home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging">Deadly Dodging</a>: Geary involves the entire fleet in this in escaping the Bear Cow home system, involving both the enemy fleet and their space station blocking the jump point out</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>: Geary apparently possesses one capable of silencing the most fractious of his captains.<ul><li> Tanya has developed one for Geary.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt">Decadent Court</a>: The Syndicate is rife with political assassination, character assassination, hostile takeovers (of planets <em>and</em> businesses), and nepotism.

The democratically elected government of the Alliance is horrifically flawed however, something Geary is perfectly aware of. The books have shown it to be filled with self-serving politicians who look out for themselves, are more interested in petty power struggles, or simply make promises that they can't deliver on. This is without getting into how they approach Geary and the rest of the fleet after the war is over and they're concerned the fleet may be more loyal to Geary than the leaders of the Alliance. Despite all of this, Geary still thinks overthrowing the government and becoming dictator is a terrible idea, even if there is enough popular support among the people for him to get away with it. It helps that there ARE senators in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Alliance that genuinely try to make things better for the average person,</a> just not as many as some would like.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>: If the Europa quarantine is broken and the plague gets loose on Old Earth, the quarantine fleet would need to expand their zone to the entire system, destroy every ship attempting to flee Sol, and then hurtle themselves into the sun.

This includes reading a personal letter to his subordinate due to its sender being a spy and allowing his Marines to lie to a man they're about to kill.<ul><li> A big problem for both sides of the war was that they gradually became numbed to this sort of thing. What they consider expedient, Geary finds monstrous. And to make it worse, most of those "harsh but necessary" actions didn't make any difference in the war, thus proving that they weren't really necessary at all.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">Don't You Dare Pity Me!</a>: Whenever Geary is reminded of just how harsh Tanya's life and career has been, she'll immediately notice and tell him not to pity her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a>: Captain Tulev's homeworld of Elyzia was bombarded until nothing was left on the surface, including his family.

The blocks invariably cause psychological damage, which can't be repaired, because the blocks invariably include a block that prevents the subject from telling anyone who could potentially help them that they have a block messing with their mind, so the damage just keeps getting worse until their mind breaks. One Alliance doctor bitterly speculates that this is how the Alliance kills people who have secrets they need buried while still officially keeping their hands clean. The Syndics just shoot people, which is more obviously immoral, but doesn't put them through years of untreatable mental torment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuctTapeForEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuctTapeForEverything">Duct Tape for Everything</a>: Humanity has developed technology to travel across the stars, but still heavily relies on duct tape. In one scene, sailors in an escape pod are depicted using it to seal leaks and as emergency bandages. Indeed, the Universal Fixing Substance, turns out to be a key to finally making friends with an alien race.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>: For a brief while, duels came into vogue with Alliance officers as means of settling disputes.

Some of these systems, where there weren't enough resources for survival without trade, have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown">Ghost Planet</a>s; the Alliance fleet rescues the last 500-some humans from a Syndic world where their employers had left them and their families to die forty years before.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes E - N&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: In the first book, Geary mentions the Third Frigate Squadron.

Repairs are underway, however, and when they are initially dismayed at the cemetery-like decaying desert landscape of Kansas, it is pointed out that native plants are coming back. As far as the rest of humanity and their ancestor-worshipping religion is concerned, of course, it is the holy of holies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">Easy Evangelism</a>: Averted. It takes a long time for Geary to convince the fleet to drop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> attitudes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a> patterns. Even when his more sensible maneuvers cause the fleet to win overwhelming victories, large amounts of his sailors are noticeably unhappy. Things do get better as time goes on, but even then a hundred years of tradition don't just get forgotten. Geary still has to word his orders in ways that don't hurt the pride of his officers (usually by rephrasing orders to retreat into orders that sound better). And even in <em>Steadfast</em>, the tenth book in the series, one of his cruisers disobeys orders in an attempt to rack up an easy kill when Geary had ordered it to scout an area and then fall back. It is promptly outflanked and destroyed, all hands lost.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics">Easy Logistics</a>: Averted. The fast fleet auxiliaries are capable of producing fuel, munitions and spare parts for the fleet, but they have to stop to find raw materials the auxiliaries need to make those things after roughly every other battle, and the fact that there's only one squadron of them and a whole lot of ships in the fleet means that the fleet still tends to use supplies faster than the auxiliaries can replace them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>: Although they fill this role, the Syndicate Worlds are themselves a huge union of various interstellar mega-corps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a>: During the final battle with the Syndics, their leadership breaks into three factions: The original civilian leadership, a second, self-appointed civilian leadership <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who object to the first group's trying to blow up the hypernet gate and destroy the entire system while they run away</span>, and a fleet commander who thinks he can exploit the chaos to take control of the Syndicate Worlds for himself. Geary and his fleet play kingmaker in favor of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the second group, who had indicated a willingness to negotiate a peace treaty.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">Enemy Within</a>: In a way. Around book three, Geary's thoughts are starting to tell him to do things he wouldn't otherwise, since he <em>could</em> get away with it. He and Madame Co-President Rione call those thoughts 'Black Jack' Geary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod">Escape Pod</a>: If a ship isn't immediately destroyed by enemy fire (either by core overload or complete obliteration), the crew is likely to be able to make it to escape pods fairly quickly. Interestingly, it's never brought up that it would be very difficult for another ship to get those pods, as they would still be traveling at about 10% of the speed of light when ejecting from the ship (this is the standard maneuvering speed of ships). Any ship trying to recover the pods would have to accelerate to a faster speed just to catch up, and at that point they would have trouble accurately detecting the pods due to relativistic distortions. Though this is probably why they usually send off destroyers, which can accelerate the fastest of any ship, to run down errant escape pods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a>: The Syndics attempt to duplicate Geary's improvised ship minefield, unsuccessfully.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>: Geary (both in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">personality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">situation</a>) seems to be somewhat based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Steve Rogers</a>.<ul><li> He's also something of an expy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, who fought a war against long odds and then refused to take up dictatorial power after he'd won.</li><li> When Geary, Rione, Charban, and Desjani visit Stonehenge in <em>Steadfast</em>, one of the locals notes that he's very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm">Face Palm</a>: Geary does this a <em>lot</em>, usually when brought up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">the modern fleet mindset</a>.

This also helps to keep the ship out of Syndic hands, whose boarding parties try to capture the ship, only to run away in terror.

As a result, systems that aren't on the hypernet slowly decline in importance, similar to how modern communities with no easy access to a highway can slowly decline into irrelevance. In the first book Geary takes the fleet to a system that is one jump away from two different hypernet-connected systems, and its defense force consists of a light cruiser and two corvettes of a class that was obsolete <em>before</em> Geary went into cryo.

Geary realizes he will have to fight a battle of attrition, trading ship for ship until both fleets are wiped out. Then Rione goes him one better by deliberately using the system's hypernet gate to trigger a nova-scale explosion, obliterating the dark ships and killing herself in the process.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">Go Mad from the Isolation</a>: Several of the rescued prisoners show a touch of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>: The Europa plague, the result of an attempt to create an undetectable bioweapon, which succeeded so well that the designers were unable to detect it when it escaped containment and infected them.

However, fleet regulations prevent Geary from having a personal relationship with a subordinate of his. Thus, he gives up his rank of fleet admiral and goes back to being acaptain. Realizing that the fleet bureaucracy has already likely re-promoted him to admiral, he refuses to read his messages and goes after Desjani. They get married before Geary is finally informed of his promotion. Geary's superiors are not amused at this turn of events.<ul><li> As mentioned in a couple other places, Geary is the senior captain in the fleet due to being in survival sleep for a century. Command of the fleet naturally devolves to either the highest ranking or most senior officer and, even though the promotion was "posthumous," this makes him the most senior captain by a century.

Shields and armor don't matter much when the goal is to inflict the highest number of losses on the enemy. In fact, battleships are the ones who get the less-than-stellar officers because it's believed that the heavier armor and shielding of a battleship may compensate for their shortcomings.</li><li> The battlecruisers do have one area in which they're better than other capital ships: speed. Their lighter armor allows them to accelerate more quickly than the battleships. This means that they excel at chasing down or intercepting enemies.</li><li> The scout battleship is even more of an example than Battlecruisers. A cross between a battleship and a heavy cruiser, it is too small and fragile to do the work of a battleship, and too large and slow to do the work of a cruiser.

When they get back to Alliance space, Geary and the others object to the council wanting to rename the ship, stating that it would be dishonorable to the soldiers who died on the ship defending it.

There's no mention made of any of our present religions, but both Alliance and Syndics believe in a divine power referred to as "the living stars." The Alliance, at least, also devotes one of the most protected areas of each ship to a chapel where people come to commune with the spirits of their ancestors.

Sometimes the auxiliaries can be full to the point of slowing the fleet down, and then end up critically low on raw materials after resupplying the fleet after a single battle. Complicating the issue is the fact that Geary tries to minimize casualties and is so good at it that the fleet's resource allocation AI has no idea how to cope with it. Needing to use supplies faster than they can be replaced catches up with Geary in the final battle of the fifth book, when ships start falling out of formation because they've completely run out of fuel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately, this battle is fought in an Alliance border system, which means that once it's over, they can call the locals for help.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">Point Defenseless</a>: Averted completely.

The enemy won't see the fleet for another however many hours &mdash; days, in some cases. And if the enemy force is large, they know there'll be a fierce battle ... in another day or three. At one point, Geary thinks about how bizarre it seems that he's leaving the bridge for about six hours to get some food and sleep while they're technically in the middle of a battle &mdash; but right then, there's literally nothing useful he <em>can</em> do except make sure he's well-rested when it's time for quick decisions.<ul><li> In the first book, an inhabited planet is described as being 1.2 light hours from the star it orbits.

The newest ships in Geary's fleet, the <em>Adroit</em> class, are also appalling underdesigned, having cut back on basically everything and with corners cut everywhere they could, including sensors so bad they need to mooch off of <em>other</em> ships' to function.

The Syndics attempt to attack the fleet with Fast Attack Craft, but the Alliance brushes this off as an ineffective tactic used out of desperation.

Crewmen are referred to as sailors, with the rank of seaman still in use, and knot-tying is still a basic skill all crewmen are expected to master. The capital ships each carry a Marine complement as well.

Fast Attack Craft (starfighters) do exist in small numbers but they're short-range, weak and easily destroyed. They're used by the aerospace forces for air and space patrol and interdiction and have a sleek, manta-like shape for atmospheric flight. A squadron can take on a Hunter-Killer at great risk, and they <em>might</em> be able to cripple a battleship, but it's mentioned that they don't stand much of a chance.<ul><li> The Syndics don't have destroyers. Instead, they have Hunter-Killers, slightly faster than destroyers but smaller and drop like flies even faster. Their system defense forces also have "nickel" corvettes, so nicknamed because they are relatively cheap to build and maintain and can be thrown away just as easily.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">Starcrossed Lovers</a>: Captain Bradamont and CEO Rogero.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Starfish Aliens</a>:<ul><li> Those who know about the enigma aliens spend most of their time trying to figure out how they might look or think, and come to very little real conclusions, fitting their name.

It's quite clear that Geary feels <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe">uncomfortable</a> with the ardent faith his subordinates have in his flawlessness.

It becomes increasingly clear throughout <em>Dreadnaught</em> that the First Fleet has been sent out to die by the Alliance government to remove the troublesome situation Geary's mere existence causes (as well as that of the VIP POW's they were ordered to pick up on the way out).

Rione snaps at Geary that this guy is a CEO, and to appeal to his greed for power. Geary suggests that, of course, when the time comes for talks, Geary will need someone he's familiar with to facilitate an agreement. The man instantly perks up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: Both sides. There are far too few combat veterans in the officer corps because the attrition rate is so high. By the time of <em>Dauntless</em>, the turnover rate of the officer corps is so high both sides are reduced to Death Before Dishonour tactics to keep fighting. To make things even worse, after Geary takes over, his ships that are three years old start falling apart at the seams due to how many corners were cut during construction. Nearly everyone in the fleet was baffled by this, simply because the rate of attrition was so high that ships simply didn't survive that long. By the end of the original series, however, this trope is subverted by the Syndics. Geary beats them in so many battles and destroys so many of their ships that they don't have enough reserves to replace them. By the time Beyond the Frontier begins, the few Syndic fleets that are still around are tiny and are comprised mainly of light ships.<ul><li> The bear-cows take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Their ships lack escape pods because their leaders don't give a crap about the underlings. Only the herd matters. The only thing that could possibly count as one is about half the size of an Alliance destroyer and is likely filled with herd leaders. Their system defenses involve a planetoid space station firing around 900 giant missiles at the enemy, and those missiles are <em>piloted</em>. When the marines try to board their superbattleship, the crew puts up a fierce resistance. Any bear-cow who is wounded is immediately finished off by the others, likely to spare it from being eaten alive (they assume any predator wants that, and humans with their incisors are recognized as predators). Anyone captured can (and will) instantly kill itself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: Two occur in quick succession in <em>Guardian</em>, when Rione reveals that the Dancers who accompanied the Alliance fleet back to Varandal have somewhere they want to go within human space, and shows the grand council a word in one of the ancient languages of humanity.<div class="indent"> "What does it say?&#148; Senator Navarro asked in amazement. &#147;Kansas."

Costa demanded. "I've never heard of a star named Kansas." "We located Kansas," Rione said. "It's not a star, or a planet. It's a place on a planet, a name for a province or region on that planet."

"Sol Star System."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong">What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</a>: Geary starts saying that in <em>Guardian</em> when the <em>Dauntless</em> enters the hypernet gate to get to Sol, only for Desjani to sharply cut him off and tell him in no uncertain terms that he better not finish that question.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight">What Did I Do Last Night?</a>: Rione has to ask Geary this the morning after a drunken BSOD upon learning her husband may be alive.
