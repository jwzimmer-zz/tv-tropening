The series is linked by its setting rather than focusing on a core group of characters; it covers roughly 3,000 years of history, all told. It is written mostly in the form of trilogies that <em>do</em> focus on a particular character, although there are a handful of independent novels as well.</p><p>The majority of the series revolves around the Kingdom of Valdemar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">its protectors</a>, the eponymous Heralds of Valdemar.

Midway through book 1, Talia is being badly affected by pretty much everyone in the immediate vicinity burning up with rage, and Jadus tells her why: a young Herald named Dirk has been horribly played by a young Court beauty. Naril made Dirk fall wildly in love with her, all for the purpose of getting her claws into his best friend Kris, who had previously rejected her. A flashback by Kris in <em>Arrow's Flight</em> spells it out as "Come to her bed until she tired of (Kris) or she would make Dirk's life hell". But when Dirk finds her out, she unleashes a vicious verbal attack that flays his ego to shreds - Kris tells Talia later that he truly thinks it was only Dirk's Companion that stopped him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">throwing himself in the river that same night</a>.

However, according to <em>Arrows of the Queen</em> (written in 1987, the first book written in the series), the Tedrel Wars were about 15 years ago, but Elspeth is only seven years old. Meanwhile, <em>Take a Thief</em> (written in 2001, and set between <em>Exile's Valor</em> and <em>Arrows of the Queen</em>) says the Tedrel Wars were 20 or 30 years ago. And finally, in <em>By the Sword</em> (which was written in 1991, and takes place at the same time as <em>Exile's Honor</em> and <em>Exile's Valor</em>, but in a different place), the king of Rethwellen dies about a year after his son's marriage to Selenay &mdash; because he has a heart attack upon hearing of his son's death.</li><li> Skif's backstory is also given multiple, contradictory versions. In <em>Take a Thief</em> (where he's the main character), he was an orphan (his father unknown, his mother dying soon after he was born) who worked for his cruel, authoritarian cousin in a tavern owned by his greedy, neglectful uncle; Skif got out from under their thumb by learning thievery from Bazie, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">kindly</a> adult who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">lost his legs</a> with fighting as a mercenary, so he now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFagin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFagin">leads a band of child thieves</a>.

The most notable aversions, in that once you've read the book, you can recognize the exact scene on the cover, are <em>The Silver Gryphon</em>, <em>Magic's Promise</em>, <em>Brightly Burning</em>, <em>Exile's Valor</em>, <em>Arrow's Fall</em>, and <em>Storm Rising</em>. <em>Closer to Home</em> is one where the cover image does not lie, but the dust-jacket description of the book does: Most of it talks about Mags' backstory as was revealed in the previous five books, but then it goes on to say that he's going to need all that experience to handle a conspiracy that doesn't actually exist, as the book actually centers around Mags' efforts to keep two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a> that independently decided to spend the Season in the capital on the same year away from each other's throats.<ul><li> The cover for the first batch of the first print run of <em>The Hills Have Spies</em> uses the synopsis for one of the very first drafts of the book, rather than the proper synopsis.

An'desha, already tired, feeling excluded from the conversation and not realising the whole thing is a private joke between two good friends, gets <em>really</em> mad at them, culminating in almost killing Darkwind with his magic without anyone noticing. In the meantime, the fake flirting between Firesong and Darkwind is so hillarous that the reader can easily be torn between laughing and wanting them to stop before An'desha gets pushed over the edge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake">Crushing Handshake</a>: Alluded to in <em>Take a Thief</em>&mdash;when Skif and Deek agree to work together, Skif is impressed that Deek <em>doesn't</em> try this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a>: The Karsite church and its god Vkandis have a distinctly Medieval Christian flavor to them.

The Crown and its employees (Palace staff and Heralds, along with most Collegium-trained Healers and Bards, and most of the Guard) believe in equality of the sexes and tolerance for all, but the Valdemaran nobility as a whole (and the guilds to a lesser extent) are patriarchal and classist. Furthermore, Valdemar has plenty of foreign cultures that have moved in or been absorbed, all with their own values; the Lake Evendim people are monotheistic and friendly to the point of cuddly, while the Holderkin are suspicious of outsiders and adhere to the forced version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> until Selenay learns just what's going on down there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> is dangerously addictive to those who practice it thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood">Evil Feels Good</a>, and it stains your soul, marking you indelibly with its taint.

By <em>Closer to the Chest</em>, it's established that there are other cruel men running gang boys to act as thieves, with the subsequent result of Mags stepping in and recruiting the boys for his messenger group.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a>: The story of Kerowyn's first heroic exploits follows her throughout the rest of <em>By the Sword</em>, rather to her chagrin.

While they trade with their neighbors and maintain good relations with everyone except Karse, they generally don't have much to do with the world outside their borders unless things have gone totally pear-shaped, in part because Vanyel's web and the gods are working to keep Valdemar secluded (being in a corner of the map, with nigh-impassible barriers on two borders, helps).

The <em>Mage Winds</em> trilogy manages to play this for a bit of humor when Starblade quips that he considered changing his name to Starshadow to reflect that he feels like a shadow of his former self... but there's already a Shadowstar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">it would be too confusing</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>: Averted, over the course of a series spanning three thousand years.<ul><li> It's hinted that in the time of the <em>Mage Wars</em> trilogy, magic had allowed society to advance far beyond what we see in Valdemar, a few thousand years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>. For instance, Amberdrake attended an "advanced" medical college that denied the reality of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Gifts</a>, and several <em>non-magical</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> weapons can be found in Urtho's tower (including something implied to be an <em>atomic bomb</em>). After the Cataclysm, societies rebuilt themselves to the medieval status we see. Over the course of several hundred years, Valdemar is founded by migrants from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, grows, absorbs smaller kingdoms, and enters into a long-standing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar">Space Cold War</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Karse</a>.</li><li> Up until Vanyel's time, this roughly applied in Valdemar and the surrounding petty kingdoms that would later join with Valdemar. Magic was widely used, particularly by the Herald-Mages, while technology and society remained essentially medieval. Vanyel, however, was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">last Herald-Mage</a>, and after that, Valdemar would have to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Gifts</a> alone.</li><li> After Vanyel's death, Valdemar's society undergoes enormous upheaval as magic fades into myth and Valdemar has to adapt to governing a much larger kingdom without the aid of magic, and limited technological development begins. <em>The Collegium Chronicles</em> and <em>The Herald Spy</em> show the establishment of formal university education at the Collegium, the development of technology to supplement more-limited Gifts <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5zzpz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5zzpz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5zzpz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For instance, Bear becomes a recognized Healer without a Healing Gift simply by becoming the Collegium's foremost expert on herbs and chirurgy</span>, and most importantly the birth of the Artificer's discipline. Society also begins shifting away from the medieval; among other things, we see increased acceptance of homosexuality and development in women's rights. Much of the plot of <em>Closer to Home</em> is driven by the tension between the medieval values of the nobility (who see women as property to be traded off) and those of the Crown and Heralds (who are liberal Havenites who see women as equal to men).</li><li> By the reign of Queen Selenay, Valdemar is technologically into the Renaissance (with the exception of gunpowder), and significantly beyond that in societal advancement. Indoor plumbing can be found in decent houses, a system of public works has provided Haven with free fountains, and every child is taught to read, write, and figure (the latter two started to be implemented back in Vanyel's day, though it took a few generations for the public works projects to spread across the entire city because of the method the crown came up with to trick the noveau rich into paying for it). The raw beginnings of Steam Age technology even emerge during <em>Mage Storms</em>, as the Artificers of the Collegium begin a crash development program to save Haven through both magic and technology. Elsewhere, it's more or less the Middle Ages, with the exception of the Eastern Empire, which has developed along <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">a different technological path</a>.</li><li> Militarily, knights and lance charges were obsolete even in Vanyel's time. (One party in <em>Closer to Home</em> is themed like an "ancient tourney," with centuries-old armor and banners dragged out of an attic in Haven.) Instead, the Valdemaran Guard develops into an early-modern national army, supplemented by nobles' household units in wartime. The Empire and Karse also have national armies, but elsewhere, the dominant army is a combination of feudal retainers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">mercenaries</a>, with an international <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion">Mercenaries' Guild</a> providing the most elite and reliable soldiers and combat mages.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenCantKeepHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenCantKeepHouse">Men Can't Keep House</a>: Keisha refers to this in <em>Owlsight</em>, when she thinks back to when the village women cleaned up Justyn's old cottage.

Whether she was really on the verge of being Chosen or just jumping to conclusions is left deliberately unclear. However, elsewhere in the series it's stated more or less outright that some people who would otherwise make very good Heralds are specifically <em>not</em> Chosen because there is some other role that it is more vital for them to play; <em>Arrows of the Queen</em> specifically notes that those with the Healing Gifts are almost never Chosen because they are needed far more as Healers than as Heralds.

The only reason he survives to the novel's final fight scene is because Caryo goes easy on him.</li><li> Under special circumstances, non-Chosen may ride Companions, or may even interact with them. Karal of Karse was in a sense Chosen by Altra the Firecat, the Karsite version of Companions. The Companion Florian didn't Choose Karal, but befriended and helped him, because he needed a better perspective of Valdemar than a Firecat could provide. Near the end of <em>Magic's Price</em>, Yfandes directly mindspeaks Stefen to help care for a traumatised Vanyel, and carries them double.</li><li> blink and you'll miss it, but it's mentioned that Keren and her brother Teren can mindspeak each other's Companions as well as their own; this is outright stated to be because they're twins. Whether this holds true for Selenay and Daren's twins is yet to be seen.</li><li> in the short stories about Herald Wil, he's eventually pulled off assignment to Haven to go back on circuit; however, this causes him major issues because he's a single father, still not over his wife's loss, and intensely bonded to toddler Ivy as a result. He asks permission to take her on circuit with him; this is allowed once an unpartnered Companion volunteers to go along to carry Ivy when in transit and play nanny while Wil's busy Heralding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">The Order</a>: The Heralds&mdash;Chosen for their abilities and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a> to defend the kingdom however they can. This Order is especially closely tied to its Kingdom, since the Monarch is required to be a Herald&#151;being Chosen ensures that he'll put his people's good above his own. They're called Heralds out of tradition; after the original King Valdemar and his Heir, the third person Chosen was Valdemar's royal herald.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Our Gods Are Different</a>: The precise nature of the gods is one of the few mysteries about the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">magic system</a> that remain unexplained.<ul><li> Several Gods and Goddesses are worshipped; it's implied at some points that they may all be different faces of a single God and Goddess, which may in turn both be faces of The One, but the details don't always quite line up to support this. At least two gods &mdash; the Star-Eyed Goddess of the Shin'a'in, Tayledras, and Kaled'a'in clans, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Karse many centuries earlier</span>, and Vkandis Sunlord of Karse <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Iftel</span> &mdash; are proven to exist and take active hands in the lives of their followers. Both are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood">benevolent</a>, but they're neither truly omnipotent or omniscient, and they can sometimes be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">jerks</a>; their philosophy is that humans have a right and responsibility to solve their own problems whenever they can, but they aren't above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">abandoning that rule whenever they have an objective that needs to be accomplished</a>.

The Hundred Little Gods are the spirits of deceased emperors, although they grant no powers and may be fictitious; and Thalhkarsh is a demon who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">gains actual power from worship</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodhoodSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodhoodSeeker">aspires to godhood</a>, though since he's stopped before his plans are complete it's never confirmed if he would have truly attained divinity or not. Demons and elemental spirits clearly come from somewhere, and it's unclear whether these are under the jurisdiction of the aforementioned gods or not. In addition, when the Star-Eyed puts in an appearance in <em>Oathbreakers</em> she comments with interest on the concept of Companions in a way that suggests she has no personal involvement in their creation or direction: she greets them as "children of my other self," but her wording leaves it unclear if she means that she and the force behind the Companions are actually separate facets of the same entity, or if she's simply recognizing their motives and values as aligned with her own.</li><li> There are also the tribal totems of the Northern Barbarians, who take animal shapes and are not omnipotent like the Star-Eyed or Sunlord; they rely on the prayers of their respective tribes, and will die if their tribe dies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Under The Vale</a>, a short essay from Larry Dixon in the same named short story collection, reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Tayledras, with their Heartstones, could all together perform god sized feats of magic.</span> Not that they knew this and it becomes moot after the Mage Storms.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent">Our Gryphons Are Different</a>: Gryphons are highly intelligent beings who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatingLifeIsAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatingLifeIsAwesome">created by the Great Mage Urtho</a> thousands of years before the founding of Valdemar, as explored in the <em>Mage Wars</em> trilogy.

It's no coincidence that all the successful Herald parents we see are permanently assigned to the capital (Selenay/Daren, Talia/Dirk, Nikolaus) or spend lots of time there (Pol). Natoli in the Mage Storms series is the daughter of a Herald, but isn't one herself; given the speech she gives to her fellow Artificers, it's fairly clear that the lack of parental participation in her upbringing left her utterly certain she didn't want to follow his career choice.</li><li> in the later stage of the short stories about Herald Wil and Bard Lyla, the conflict between being a single father and Herald causes major issues for him, and is the focus of more than one story. He has to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAThirdOption">creative</a> in order to resolve said conflict.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotPetPosition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotPetPosition">Parrot Pet Position</a>: Used by some but not all Tayledras bondbirds.

It is used in a way that barely straddles the line between good and evil; it's even stated that Kethry's greatest challenge is not to let the sheer power of all that rage overwhelm her, lest she fall to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>.</li><li> Talia's <em>literal</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> of a (physical) rapist also qualifies; it was an act of calculated rage on her part, but she felt absolutely no remorse afterward, comparing it to shooting bandits and noting that if the man ever truly repents, he'll be freed.</li><li> When Vanyel stood against Lord Nedran of Hardorn and his demon-summoning wizard, who had been sacrificing his own people for power, he released the demons upon Nedran.

In the <em>Mage Storms</em> trilogy, Iftel is revealed to be populated by Kaled'a'in and a good many nonhumans such as gryphons, something that one would think at least one of those Guild reps might have found interesting enough to give them a reason to stick around. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> for this one might be inferred from the fact that Iftel was not merely unsociable, but an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a> on a national scale.

In later books, when Need is "awake," she can still do this, though she usually asks permission first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a>: A truly astonishing number of villains try this ploy on Vanyel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">It never works</a>, but it doesn't stop them from trying. To be fair, he'd be a great guy to have on your side rather than fighting you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: Accurately sums up the attitude of both Ancar and Falconsbane towards military tactics (Though Falconsbane is willing to acknowledge that when you <em>don't</em> have reserves, you need to take care of the troops available to you), and also nearly wipes out the Skybolts.<ul><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> with Hardorn&mdash;it's suggested that, if Ancar hadn't been killed when he was, he'd have wiped out his own people.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWeather">Weird Weather</a>: <em>The Mage Storm</em> Trilogy documents the after effects of the Cataclysm. The most noticeable one is two magical storms wreaking havoc on the country side. Where they interact people spot circles of destruction, magical corruption that warps and changes people and animals, and other strange magical phenomena.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>:<ul><li> Vanyel is troubled by this for a significant portion of his life... not so much to get his father to approve of his accomplishments as to approve of <em>him</em>.</li><li> Subverted in <em>Winds of Fate</em> with Darkwind and his father. In his youth, Darkwind was close to his parents. But when the Heartstone was sabotaged, and Darkwind's mother died, his father turned against him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that Darkwind's father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Controlled</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and is deliberately trying to drive his son away to protect him, in the only way he can. When the spell is broken, Darkwind is amazed at the change in his personality and wonders how he could have failed to notice.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: The second book in the <em>Last Herald Mage</em> trilogy features a Tayledras Heartstone in (what was then) a small nation on Valdemar's frontier, which is holding together a fault line. Fast forward several centuries to the <em>Mage Storms</em> trilogy, and all the mages are scrambling to make sure nothing goes wrong with the Heartstone in Haven due to the storms, but the other one is never addressed; it could conceivably have mended the fault line and gone inactive by then, but it's never mentioned one way or the other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?</a>: Played every which way but straight. Most characters with minimal or very specialized talents soon find ways to demonstrate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude">What's Up, King Dude?</a>: Valdemar's monarchs tend toward an open door policy. The Palace grounds are open to the public, and Mags (at that point, just a regular Herald) is allowed to barge into the middle of an emergency royal council and bluntly tell the King to settle down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Firesong gets lambasted in the <em>Mage Storms</em> trilogy for his fits of jealous rage over An'desha's friendship with Karal. It turns out he was being driven crazy by the storms themselves, so all ends up forgiven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">When She Smiles</a>: Talia is often regarded this way, since she's serious so much of the time. During her wedding preparations, Jeri laments, "Two <em>hours</em> I spend on her, and in the blink of an eye <em>he</em> makes everything I've done look insignificant!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent">Why Couldn't You Be Different?</a>: Vanyel gets a lot of this from his family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Wife Husbandry</a>: Reversed; Hulda raised Ancar to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">tyrant king</a>, and being his lover was merely a part of that. Also subverted in that Hulda regards him as merely a tool and is more than willing to cast him aside once he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">outlives his usefulness</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">Wise Beyond Their Years</a>:<ul><li> Talia is precocious enough as a thirteen year old girl to have an insightful conversation with Queen Selenay before even knowing who she is. This as much as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">empathy</a> makes her ideally suited to be the Queen's Own.</li><li> In <em>Exile's Valor,</em> Alberich speculates that the Herald's training is a rushed maturation process. By the time most Heralds are graduated at 18 years, they are as mature as people in their 30s.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>:<ul><li> The traumatic awakening of Lavan Firestorm's powers leaves him mentally fragile and only his bond with his Companion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">keeps him sane and his power in check</a>. When she dies, all bets are off.</li><li> This almost certainly would have happened to Vanyel, were it not for his mentor's relationship with the Tayledras.</li><li> Talia has an early bout with this, due to her abilities as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">The Empath</a> and the fact that the Collegium critically failed when training her, leaving her completely unable to control her gift. Kris, under circumstances that amount to direct divine intervention, manages to get her Gift trained before she loses it completely, but nearly gets killed while doing so.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility">With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</a>: One of the driving tenets behind nearly every Herald's character. Herald-Mage Vanyel and Queen's Own Herald Talia have this to a particularly high degree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">Wizards Live Longer</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a>: There are several schools of magic, with White Winds being the most mentioned one, that has several branches since all graduating mages that reach Master or Adept level are supposed to found schools of their own. Tarma and Kethry end up starting a combination fighting/mage school towards the end of <em>Oathbreakers</em>. In the <em>Owls</em> trilogy, it's mentioned that a Mage Collegium was set up so that non-Herald Mages can get training and learn to use their magic ethically.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask</a>: Many Queens (and Kings, for that matter) of Valdemar would be this, save for the Monarch's Own Herald whose job it is to act as an absolutely trustworthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant">confidant</a>. Before Talia showed up, Selenay was on the verge of truly falling victim to the isolation of her position, and made some disastrous choices that nearly cost her life and caused her daughter to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a>. Upon coming of age, Elspeth renounces the throne in order to avoid a similar fate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. Vanyel discovers to his dismay, near the beginning of <em>Magic's Promise</em>, that people fear the possible consequences that may result from the combination of his extraordinary degree of power and the equally extraordinary amount of stress he is almost perpetually under. A Herald himself goes to serve Vanyel rather than sending a page and risking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> that blows up the Palace (or even the entire city of Haven).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">World Sundering</a>: The Cataclysm</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWreckingWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWreckingWave">World-Wrecking Wave</a>: The Cataclysm, which takes the form of waves of magical energy emanating from the twin foci of Ma'ar and Urtho's citadels. Where the interaction of the waves produces a "crest", massive destruction is wrought even by comparison with the original purely physical blast. In <em>Mage Storms</em>, the Valdemaran artificers plan much of the Allies' defense against the storms on the basis of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">geometric analysis of the wave patterns</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">You Didn't Ask</a>: Elspeth is infuriated when she finds out that her Companion, Gwena, never bothered to tell her that she is also a mage. Or Grove-born.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouExclamation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouExclamation">"You!" Exclamation</a>: Mags receives one from the mad foreign assassin at the end of <em>Foundation</em>. His search to discover why the unknown assassin recognises him links in to discovering the identity of his parents, with both questions at least partially answered in the fourth book and completely resolved in the fifth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">You Shall Not Pass!</a>:<ul><li> Vanyel pulls a great big one at the end of <em>Magic's Price</em>.<ul><li> He pulls a smaller one at Stony Tor in the song <em>Demonsbane</em>.</li></ul></li><li> Darian's master pulls one at the start of <em>OwlFlight</em>, leaving Darian with massive unresolved guilt over his dislike and contempt for the old man.</li><li> Lavan tried one at the end of <em>Brightly Burning</em>, but it ended up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> instead.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
