In Xanth, magic is real, with its own physical laws, often based on reader-submitted (and credited) puns. Billions, and billions of puns. For example &mdash; Pineapples are explosive (aka <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_2_grenade">pineapple fragmentation grenade<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). Cherries (cherry bombs) are smaller, but still dangerous. Tulips (two lips) will kiss you if you get too close. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoonerism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoonerism">Boot rear</a> is a fizzy soda that, when drunk, causes you to feel a swift kick to your bottom.

This can be anything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaleidoscopeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaleidoscopeHair">changing their hair color</a>, to being able to talk to certain animals, to being able to "enhance" whatever is in front of you temporarily (whether that is to "enhance" someone's muscles, "enhance" a car's engine, etc.), to being able to rewind time or warp reality in their nearby vicinity. Talents are unique to the person who has them &mdash; no two talents are the same, but some are so similar that they are more or less identical; "turn stuff blue" versus "turn stuff azure", for example.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The first book, <em>A Spell for Chameleon</em>, was written in 1977, and the series continues to this day (with #41 releasing in 2017 and more just waiting for publication), recently entering its 2nd trilogy.

She has to remove those words from his mind because he's a child and that sort of thing being repeated to the other goblin children will make them the worst generation ever, and since their goal is to improve the goblins as a species, he has to be stopped.</li><li> In Xanth, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a>, curse words really do invoke curses; saying them can do things like set the roof of your house on fire.

Mistake! She's a sorceress, so she artificially ages herself long enough to force him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">love spring</a> and er, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">seduce</a> him before the artificial age magic wears off. Love springs have the side effect of forcing the two people affected by it to mate, and making it guaranteed to work. This leaves him stuck in love with her, just in time for the stork to deliver their new child... oh, and the Adult Conspiracy makes an appearance as well, a few hours too late &mdash; his new "wife" forgets all the details right after the age magic wears off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a>: A variant &mdash; Piers Anthony includes a chapter's long Author's Note after the end of every novel he writes, in which he talks about whatever was on his mind while he was writing the novel.

Minor scrapes and bruises apparently do not count, either.<ul><li> However, due to how subtle it is, Trent regards Bink's talent as <em>extremely</em> dangerous to anyone who is or may become a threat to Bink. In the first book, the senile and ill King who insisted Bink be exiled to Mundania (where there is no magic and therefore his talent could not protect him) sickened and died, allowing Trent (who was Bink's friend, knew about his talent, and was no threat to Bink) to assume the throne. This allowed Trent to decree that Bink could stay in Xanth, made Bink a member of the Royal Court so that making an enemy of Bink also meant that King Trent would be your enemy, and allowed Bink to be with Chameleon, whom he'd fallen in love with. All these events happening just by coincidence? Perhaps, but Trent had seen very well how Bink's talent used coincidence and happenstance to Bink's benefit, and therefore knew it could end up being very bad for <em>anyone</em> that Bink's talent came to regard as a threat.</li></ul></li><li> A number of characters have talents that could qualify as this. The title character of <em>The Dastard</em>, for example, had the amazing talent of <em>coming up with bad ideas</em>. He ended up selling his soul for a better talent, but since the idea to do so came to him when he had his original talent, it was of course itself a bad idea.</li><li> Then there's beings like the Gorgon, who must cover her face or turn anyone who sees her into stone. Absent Mindedness has also appeared as a Talent. And Dishonesty. And Bad Luck. And Making Mistakes. And Mispronunciation. And having nobody ever get your name right.</li><li> And being able to make any wish and get <em>half</em> of what you wanted. Doesn't sound so bad, right? You'd settle for half a fortune (or just wish for two of them). Well, it sucks if your first wish was to be a Wit.</li><li> Bink's wife, Chameleon's, talent is that her physical beauty and intelligence go through a high/low monthly cycle, but cycle in opposite directions, so that she's a beautiful dolt (subject to being taken advantage of by the village louts) on one end and a genius hag no one can stand to be around on the other.</li><li> Esk Ogre has to deal with disadvantages gained from his half-human parents: He has occasional bouts of ill-tempered stupidity (his half-ogre dad) and empty-headed vapidity (his half-nymph mother).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>:<ul><li> Centaurs view reproduction as natural, but someone possessing a magical talent is deeply obscene (they only barely tolerate it in humans because they see humans as a "lesser species"); ditto for crossbreeding and mentioning their non-centaur heritage.</li><li> The greater demons, such as X(A/N)th: explaining the concept that cooperation produces the best results over time to him is important in one of the earlier books, and he eventually adopts that strategy.</li><li> Ogres take pride in their stupidity, and view intelligence as a shameful stigma.

While the magic was gone, though, most of Xanth suffered weird aftereffects and many people were distraught to find their talents unusable. This is referred to as "The Time of No Magic". It's later explained in <em>The Dastard</em> that the magic was never really gone: each of the World Demons have their own magic ambiance, and thus when the Demon X(A/N)th left, the magic he'd left behind was not eliminated outright, but merely suppressed by the ambiance of the Demon E(A/R)th's own magic from his neighboring realm.

Bink's response, hearing the story presented at the trial by the judge (not her), which wasn't what was going on at all and was incredibly biased against her, is that it's understandable: what was a man going to do with a beautiful woman asking him to sleep with her? Since, at the time, he didn't know about the consent issue and thought that since she'd said yes at the time and 'changed her mind later' it was unfair to accuse the man of rape. The first time Bink encounters Chameleon in Wynne-phase knowing what's going on, however her attempts to seduce him occasionally edge into molestation, and to a modern reader it's a pretty clear analogue for someone given a date rape drug. Keep in mind that Wynne-mode Chameleon is essentially a nymph, and it's made clear in the first book that young men are encouraged by older men to use nymphs for guilt-free sex, as opposed to real women. Since nymphs, like Chameleon herself, are magically mutated humans... And then, just to bring things full circle, Bink has sex with Wynne-mode Chameleon, despite her having the intelligence of a child.

His designation as the "Evil Magician" in the first book proves to be largely untrue. He never used his talent in a way that killed or physically harmed anyone and some of his transformations were even done with the well-being of the one transformed in mind. (For example, when he changed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cynthia Centaur</span>, his decision to give her wings wasn't made out of malice, but because he didn't want her to join the centaurs, as he knew how critical and judgmental they could be.) It's later explained that he was largely only ever called "Evil" because he was opposed to the rightful King of Xanth. In <em>A Spell for Chameleon</em> he admits that he was at least untrustworthy, but his traits were exaggerated. His stay in Mundania cures him of a lot of his faults.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Dragon on a Pedestal</em>, Xap Hippogryff drinks from a love spring, but is apparently unaffected.

As part of this plan, the morning after their wedding, Electra takes a potion to rid her of her magic-induced love for Dolph. It doesn't work, because the magic-induced love has already faded and been replaced with natural love in the four years they've known one another. Fortunately, Dolph has also developed natural love for her by this point, and they stay married.</li><li> This is how Grey Murphy's talent manifests in <em>Man from Mundania</em> (at first no one realizes it's his talent; they think it's coincidence or his inherent skepticism about magic somehow pulling a reverse-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a>: Lacuna has a magic talent that allows her to alter printed text, or make printed words appear.

Cases include:<ul><li> When Xanth's first King, King Merlin (Magician of Knowledge), died, there were three Magicians who could take the throne. One, his son Jonathan (AKA the Zombie Master) wasn't interested, so Magicians Roogna (Magician of Adapting Living Magic) and Murphey (Magician Who Makes Things Go Wrong) had to compete against one another for the kingship; Roogna won and married Merlin's daughter Taplin.</li><li> When King Rune (Magician of Evocation) died, the only known option was Jonathan, who was a zombie by then, and reluctantly became Xanth's sixth king, reigning for a hundred years until abdicating in disgust at the job.</li><li> When the tenth King Gromden was dying, he required Magician Yin and Magician Yang (actually two personalities of the same man) to compete against one another to succeed him. Yang won and became the eleventh King, Magician of Invokable Spells.</li><li> King Ebnez (Magician of Adapting Inanimate Magic), the sixteenth King, died with no true Magicians to succeed him, but declared Humfrey's talent of finding information to be Magician-level and named him as his successor.</li><li> Humfrey's successor, King Aeolus (Magician of Storms) died with three living Magicians (and Jonathan the Zombie) to succeed him, but Bink's talent wasn't publicly known to be Magician-level, Humfrey didn't want the job back, Jonathan was hanging out around Castle Roogna (which had only just been rediscovered, and nobody really knew about him at the time), and the only other option had tried to seize the throne from Aeolus earlier in life. Still, he was a Magician, and so Trent (Magician of Transformation) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown">Offered the Crown</a> and became one of Xanth's best kings.</li><li> During the Nextwave (or Fourteenth Wave) invasion of 1067, their ally the Horseman managed to nullify King Trent, trapping his mind in the Gourd realm. Consequently, Dor (Magician of Inanimate Communication) took the throne, and after he was nullified in the same manner, was succeeded by each of Xanth's other Magicians in turn: Jonathan, Humfrey, Bink, Arnolde Centaur (Magician of the Magic Aisle), Iris (Sorceress of Illusion), and Irene (Sorceress of Plant-Growing). Irene names a non-Magician, her mother-in-law Chameleon, as her successor, and Chameleon names Mare Imbri as the tenth King of the chain, with Imbri finally defeating the Horseman and freeing her predecessors. Afterward, Trent retakes the throne, but only until he can abdicate and pass it to Dor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">Super Empowering</a>: Ivy's ability can selectively supercharge people's properties, including their magical talents. Her husband Grey can do the same thing by canceling out magical properties, when they're turned back on the built-up energy causes their talents to come back by multiple times. And the Demon X(A/N)th can do this both at will (as he did to Breanna of the Black Wave) and by simply existing, as he is the source of magic that saturates Xanth and causes people to develop their own magic.<ul><li> This is the <strong>weakest</strong> level of Ivy's Talent. At higher levels, it can also act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareBearStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareBearStare">Care-Bear Stare</a> (why Stanley didn't just kill her despite being rejuvenated to a baby) and approach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping">Reality Warping</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a>: Magician-level parents led to children with Magician caliber powers.

There are weak but useful abilities, for example determining the direction of anything (including 'Source of Magic'), or speak any language. The relatively few useless talents are called 'Spot on the Wall' talents. Magician levels are Illusion (at a range, that you can see through, that encompass <em>all five senses</em>), the ability to turn anyone but yourself into any other living creature, the ability to turn yourself into any other living creature, making things true by agreeing with them (only barely avoiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a> status by the fact that the thing agreed with has to come from someone unaware of her talent), knowing damn near everything, enhancement (of anything, without apparent limit, and including "enhancement" of negative traits), nullification of magic (no matter how powerful), and being immune to magical harm.</li><li> The "immune to magical harm" talent hides itself as well, so that people don't wise up and try to hurt him by mundane means either. Not there <em>are</em> very many entirely mundane means available; Xanth is so thoroughly infused with magic that even the simplest objects are probably at least a little bit magical. The talent also stops <em>indirect</em> magical harm in its protections, so something like magically hiding the edge of a cliff from him and trying to get him to fall off wouldn't work either. It's even theorized in-universe that when the omnipotent demon that's the source of all magic in Xanth left, shutting all the magic down, the talent made him come back very shortly afterward, as removing magic and leaving nothing but nonmagical danger could be considered indirect magical harm. That's right, it's so powerful that it can even affect <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">its own omnipotent source</a></em>.</li><li> Bink even (without trying to) makes winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> a hereditary trait; he impressed the above-mentioned omnipotent demon, who decided that all of the character's descendants would also be Magicians/Sorceresses. The demon never told him about this reward, though.</li><li> Surprise Golem, perhaps the ultimate winner of the Superpower Lottery, has the talent of <em>having whatever talent she wants</em>. Each talent can only be used once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but eventually regenerates</span>. However, using minor variations can easily overcome that flaw, and a little creativity can produce an almost infinite number of variations on any given talent. Unaddressed is what would happen if she simply picked "omnipotence" as her current talent and never switched to a different one.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a>: The Gorgon's power. Also caused by one of Magician Yin-Yang's spells, which turned Jordan the Barbarian to stone (fortunately, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> fixed it within a day or so).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: The Baldwin family pets are Woofer (a dog), Tweeter (a parakeet) and Midrange (a cat), who are all named after different types of loudspeakers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman</a>: No matter how obscure or specialized a main character's talent is, you can bet they'll get a chance to use it to save the day- justified in that many of the tales begin with someone getting an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalLettersAreMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalLettersAreMagic">Answer to their Question</a> from Humfrey, who gets rid of the annoying morons &mdash; er, <em>enables the querent to discover their own answer</em> by sending them on a quest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredtotheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredtotheParty">they are perfect for.</a><ul><li> Humfrey's three challenges that you have to pass to enter his castle have a variation on this. They almost always require the use of your talent, but in an indirect way that you have to really think about to come up with - no simple Point A to Point B here.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transflormation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transflormation">Transflormation</a>: Eventually becomes Trent's go-to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a>. One of the major examples is Justin Tree, who becomes a fixture of the North Village for seventy-six years (Trent finally turns him back at his request, after his adventure with Breanna in <em>Zombie Lover</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">Triang Relations</a>: In <em>Heaven Cent</em>, Dolph becomes engaged to two girls: Nada, who he loves, and Electra, who loves him. Both girls have external reasons why they need to marry him, and Dolph decides to maintain both betrothals until they can come up with a solution; the tangle is resolved two books later in <em>Isle of View</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer">Un-Sorcerer</a>:<ul><li> Bink appears to be one of these at the beginning of the first book. He later learns that he does have a talent, one that's extremely powerful, but nobody can figure out what it is &mdash; and, as far as the law is concerned, if he can't <em>demonstrate</em> it, it's the same as not having one and he'll be exiled anyway. Eventually, someone figures out exactly what his talent is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">he cannot be harmed by magic</a>. Furthermore, because the talent itself is magic, it has to protect him from itself, too &mdash; which means keeping itself secret so that other people don't try to hurt him using non-magical means. As a result, it only acts via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a>; it winds up blowing its cover when Bink ends up in so much danger that the coincidences needed to save him become <em>so</em> contrived that they couldn't possibly have happened naturally.</span></li><li> Aside from Bink, anyone from Mundania who ends up living in Xanth is effectively one of these.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a>: In the eighth book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there's Jordan, who not only blundered into a journey being promised as a prophesied hero. The whole thing was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> by Magician Ying-yang to bring Threnody to him to marry so he could become king. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">This brings Xanth into its Dark Age for four hundred years, until Trent shows up.</a></span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic">Utility Magic</a>: A lot of the magic has mundane purposes. For example, the Gorgon's face, when exposed, can turn people to stone. However, after her marriage to Humfrey, she mainly uses its stiffening effects on a certain type of food to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Gorgon-zola</a> cheese.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityIsFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityIsFeminine">Vanity Is Feminine</a>: Becoming vain is often seen as a positive sign of female growth. Of course, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress">downsides....</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VertebrateWithExtraLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VertebrateWithExtraLimbs">Vertebrate with Extra Limbs</a>: Pretty much any mammalian species with wings, including winged centaurs (who have four legs, two arms and two wings) and winged goblins. There are also dragons, which tend to have a minimum of four legs plus wings. The Gap Dragons take things up a notch by having <em>six</em> legs and vestigial wings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption">Violence Is the Only Option</a>: Notably and almost universally averted throughout the series, beginning with the first book, in which the villain, Trent, turns out to have lots of redeeming qualities and is essentially convinced to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>. Occasional exceptions include <em>Castle Roogna</em> and <em>Night Mare</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>: Were-creatures, demons, certain crossbreeds (like nagas, who go from human to snake and have an in-between form as well, or merfolk, some of whom can switch from having a tail to having legs, or even Smash Ogre, an ogre/human who learns to switch between his two aspects), and Prince Dolph are notorious for this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchingTheReflectionUndress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchingTheReflectionUndress">Watching the Reflection Undress</a>: In <em>Demons Don't Dream</em>, Nada Naga insists to Dug that he must not try to see her naked. When she changes in one scene, he attempts to sneak a peek at her anyway with his belt buckle, and the "computer game" that he's playing to connect him to the world of Xanth ends up booting him out because of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsGradeVocabulary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsGradeVocabulary">Weapons-Grade Vocabulary</a>: Since Xanth runs on puns, curse words function as actual curses. Part of the reason the Adult Conspiracy (To Keep Interesting Things From Children) exists is that children knowing these words actually makes them <em>dangerous</em>. Dealing with a goblin child who's learned the forbidden words makes up a major part of the plot in <em>The Color of Her Panties</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWeather">Weird Weather</a>: It experiences Madness Storms near the source of the realm's magic. These usually result in the temporary enhancement or derangement of existing magic and perceptions, but stronger storms can cause temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos">World of Chaos</a> conditions in the area as the line between hallucination, illusion, and reality blurs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheRealWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheRealWorld">Welcome to the Real World</a>: Mundania, the world outside of Xanth in which magic does not exist, is supposed to be the same place that the reader lives in. Characters sometimes travel between Mundania and Xanth. (The nature of the border between Xanth and Mundania is complicated, but you can get there by entering just about any peninsula in Mundania.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?</a>: Referred to in-story as "Spot-On-The-Wall talents".<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a>: A lame talent used efficiently and with intelligence often is just as useful as a Magician-level talent.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">When Trees Attack</a>: The carnivorous Tangle Trees, which attack and eat people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a>: Except for the opening and ending chapters, <em>Crewel Lye</em> and <em>Question Quest</em>. The former tells the story of Jordan the Barbarian and how he met Threnody, and the latter covers the life of Good Magician Humfrey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">Who Names Their Kid "Dude"?</a>: At least some goblins have names that seem odd by human standards (and elf standards, and centaur standards). When Moron, Idiot and Imbecile (and Stupid, who is mentioned only) are introduced in <em>Isle of View</em>, Jenny Elf doesn't realize they're being called by their names until Che Centaur explains it, and once she understands, she comments that "Goblins have funny names!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfPun">World of Pun</a>: There's been a steady increase in puns throughout the series. The first two books had only a handful of puns. After that, Piers Anthony started making the series more comedic, and adding more puns as part of the process. Then he started accepting reader-submitted puns and it and got completely out of control. Naturally, a great many <em>Xanth</em> fans were thrilled by this opportunity to actually be a part of their favorite series, even if only in a small way, so the puns flooded in ever-greater numbers, to the point that Anthony frequently has several books' worth of pun backlog.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: When the "Colored People" accidentally arrived in Xanth they were specifically treated as equals, and several pages are spent talking about this. (They're still called "colored people" &mdash; but now those colors include blue, green, red, yellow, pink, etc., etc...)<ul><li> Mr. Anthony's views on sexuality (it's not bad, and it springs into our minds a lot sooner than 18 or even 16 years old) and nudity ("Some time we'll have to discuss why the sight of a naked woman as God made her should be considered to harm a child, but that's another issue") appear as a subtext in nearly every book. Even "worse" with the nonhuman characters, who, almost as a rule, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">have little or no nudity taboo</a>.<ul><li> A further writer on board thing deals with how his centaurs reject magic as obscene. This is then directly compared to humans rejecting nudity and bodily functions as obscene. (In Book 2 &mdash; <em>The Source of Magic</em> &mdash; for those who are about to say "WHEN?")</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>: This is essentially how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bink's</span> talent works &mdash; no matter how you try to use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">magic</span> against him, bizarre circumstances will prevent him from being hurt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMagicsNoGoodHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMagicsNoGoodHere">Your Magic's No Good Here</a>: <em>Isle of View</em> introduces Jenny Elf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>'s World of Two Moons. When she arrives on Xanth, her telepathy no longer seems to work. But she develops another ability never shown in her home environment; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">singing daydreams and trapping the unaware within them</span>.</li></ul><hr>
