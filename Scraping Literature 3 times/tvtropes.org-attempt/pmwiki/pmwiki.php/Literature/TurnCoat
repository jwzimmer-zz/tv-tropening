His replacement is suspected by Harry and Ebenezer to be a new mole working for the Black Council. On top of that, it becomes apparent that Luccio's relationship with Harry was a consequence of her brainwashing in an effort to keep an eye on him. To make matters even worse, the White Council, which is already suffering a critical shortage of manpower, thanks to the ongoing war with the Red Court, lost several more wizards during Peabody's attack at the trial.
