She also confiscates their brooms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil">Absurdly Powerful Student Council</a>: Umbridge attempts to create one with her "Inquisitorial Squad", who can take points off people for whatever they feel like and have greater authority than the Prefects &mdash; which, as Ernie indignantly points out, makes the Prefect system completely superfluous.

First Hermione insists that Harry meet her at noon in the Three Broomsticks, saying it's important. Even when Harry tells Hermione he's planning to spend the day with Cho, Hermione says Harry can bring her, too. When Harry tells Cho, she seems to be a bit thrown but otherwise okay. Hermione explains that Harry should have sold the meeting to Cho as a real chore, but Hermione made him promise, and he'd try and get it done quickly, and should have mentioned how ugly he thinks Hermione is. Then, when they stop to have tea, Roger Davies from the Ravenclaw Quidditch team is present, and Cho mentions that he'd asked her out, too, but she turned him down. Hermione explains that Cho said this because, still a bit annoyed that Harry had agreed to meet another girl on his Valentine's Day with her, she was trying to make him jealous. And Harry did get a bit jealous, but he's nonconfrontational enough that he didn't let it show. Then Cho starts talking about Cedric, which <em>really</em> throws Harry for a loop, since every time Cho talks about Cedric she starts crying, and Harry doesn't want her to be sad. He also hasn't come close to processing his own feelings about Cedric's death, and doesn't want to think that Cho would rather be here with Cedric instead of him. Hermione explains that Cho needs to try and work out her feelings about Cedric's death, and Harry's the only one she feels she can talk to, since they're the two who were most affected by it (Cho was dating him, Harry was there when he was killed and indirectly caused his death). She also genuinely likes Harry, and is having a lot of very confusing feelings between her attraction to him and her mourning for Cedric, and just needs to talk some things out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Ron suggests Hermione should write a book explaining how girls think so boys can understand.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">Meaningful Echo</a>: "Weasley is our King", doubles an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a> to the Slytherins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a><ul><li> Detention with Dolores.

To set the tone, this book starts with Harry struggling to cope with the most traumatic event in his life so far (witnessing Cedric being murdered before his eyes, being tortured by knives and the Cruciartus Curse by the man he fears most while all alone and isolated from anyone's help, let alone how Voldemort toyed with him and nearly killed him once again). Said event has clearly given him PTSD and constant nightmares, and the only company he has are his abusive relatives, as his friends won't even write to him, nor can he get any information on Voldemort's current actions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Every time he thinks his situation can't get worse,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">does.</a><ul><li> He's then attacked and nearly has his soul sucked out by Dementors, barely manages to survive and is then nearly expelled on the spot for performing magic. He's brought to Grimmauld Place where he's further kept in the dark by the Order despite how much he's fought against Voldemort in the past. He does manage to be cleared of his charges at the hearing but Dumbledore ignores him and refuses to look at him. Umbridge tortures Harry during multiple detentions using a blood-quill that scars him, and Harry becomes more and more isolated from his peers as they ostracize him for not believing his claims, and Umbridge continues to gain more power. Harry then finds that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he has a psychic link with Voldemort that can make him peer into his mind and influence him, making Harry fear that he's been somewhat poisoned by him mentally and might lash out at his closest peers.</span> Things continue to keep escalating (such as Harry and Cho's fallout, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the DA being forcefully disbanded and Dumbledore being forced to leave the school</span>), until it finally reaches a climax with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry receiving a vision of Sirius being kidnapped at the Department of Mysteries, which prompts him and his friends to go there to save him. However, it was really a trap by Voldemort to have Harry retrieve the prophecy and causes him and his friends to fight for their lives against Death Eaters (which gets most of Harry's classmates wounded and knocked out), spiralling into an all out battle between them and the Order that puts all of them in grave peril, and culminates in the death of Sirius, Harry's only real family. Harry chases Sirius's killer in anger, only to run into Voldemort who immediately tries to kill him, though Dumbledore rescues him barely. But shortly after, Voldemort manages to possess Harry and tries to kill him, nearly succeeding until Harry's love for Sirius drives him out. Needless to say, when Dumbledore tries to talk to him, Harry is absolutely livid and throws a tantrum after everything he's been through, destroying much of his office. But it's still not over, Dumbledore then tells Harry (some of) the truth behind his circumstances, that he's the Chosen One destined to oppose Voldemort and that as a result, one of them will kill the other eventually as a result.</span> The poor boy really has the weight of the world on his shoulders.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaSwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaSwing">Trauma Swing</a>: Harry does one of these at the start of the book (it's the only swing in the park that Dudley and his gang haven't broken).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Treachery Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The curse Hermione gave to anyone ratting on Dumbledore's Army was a permanent marking on the front.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTimerDate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTimerDate">Two-Timer Date</a>: Harry averts this on Valentine's Day in Hogsmeade, which is when Hermione has set up Rita Skeeter's interview with him.

The shock is so much so that he gets a lot of angst about whether or not everything he'd thought about his father was a lie. He eventually talks to Sirius and Lupin about it and they explain to him that, yes James was being a jackass in that specific instance, but he was an immature teenager at the time and was still a good man and a good husband overall.
