Rather than simply killing Harry after using his blood to regain his body, Voldemort not only has Wormtail cut him loose and give him back his wand, but insists on fighting him in a one-to-one duel and forbids interference from any of his Death Eaters, for no other reason than to prove, once and for all, that he is the stronger of the two. The final result of this is that Harry manages to escape Voldemort's attempt on his life, once again through luck, and warn everyone of Voldemort's resurrection.

It ensures that the selected champions will have the necessary magical knowledge to complete the highly dangerous tasks. Their reasoning is proven sound when Cedric and Fleur can use the Bubble-Head Charm to breathe underwater in the second task, whereas Harry has to use Gillyweed stolen from Snape's potion supply (given to him by Dobby, no less) because he doesn't know about that spell. Conversely, Fred and George are rightly angered that Cedric, who is in the same year as them and has had the same exact education (though his school scores were almost certainly better), is allowed to put his name in the Goblet of Fire when they aren't just because his seventeenth birthday happened to fall before the entry deadline and theirs didn't.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Brainwashed</a>:<ul><li> Averted in Harry's case.

Hermione admits this in a private moment. They do absolutely nothing of any use to anyone, they're exceptionally dangerous, their very existence is illegal as their creation requires breaking the Ban on Experimental Breeding, and caring for them is a complete waste of class time because they do not exist in the wild (though learning to care for a brand-new creature could be useful practical experience for the budding magizoologist, all that means is the Skrewts should be assigned to a NEWT-level class, not a bunch of fourth-years).</li><li> The organisers of the Triwizard Tournament also have this in mind, as only allowing of-age students to participate ensures that they'll have the necessary magical know-how to overcome a lot of their obstacles, such as Cedric and Fleur being able to use charms that give them air-bubbles, whereas Harry requires Gillyweed stolen from Snape's potion supply.</li><li> When Hermione tells Rita off for spreading innuendo about "anyone&#133; even Ludo Bagman," Rita retorts, "I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She reported on Bagman's trial for helping the Death Eaters after Voldemort's fall.</span></li><li> Barty Crouch Sr. was a tough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge">Hanging Judge</a>, and not even merciful enough to presume innocence. As Sirius grudgingly admits, however, during the First Wizarding War, a tough force like him was inevitable when Voldemort was spreading his reign of terror. The Death Eaters were murdering Muggle-borns and Muggles alike, causing chaos and ruining lives. Crouch Sr.'s methods at least brought in results and reduced the collateral damage that would have otherwise ensued, although he did end up throwing some innocent people in Azkaban along the way (like Sirius himself). It also turns out that the charges against the Lestranges and Crouch Jr. were justified, as Bellatrix in the next book gleefully refers to torturing Neville's parents, and they totally deserved Azkaban.</li><li> Moody is less mean than Crouch, which Sirius also describes &mdash; he only has one known Death Eater casualty because he'd bring most of them in alive &mdash; but he is also tough in his approach to them. He says that "filth" like Karkaroff deserve the Dementors after they caused a reign of terror, and they can't just evade the consequences because they decide to turn traitor; whereas the question of if <em>anyone</em> deserves the Dementors is morally ambiguous, he is right that Death Eaters shouldn't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">escape consequences of murdering and torturing innocent people</a>.

Of course, if he wasn't already firmly a Death Eater before he went to Azkaban, he must've been easily been converted while he was doing his time, with the Lestranges' combined fanaticism and the Dementors' despairing influence, and tried to seek out Voldemort as soon as he was smuggled out and nursed back to health.

And she completely misses the point about why any house-elves are unhappy &mdash; their working conditions, not the work itself or lack of pay.
