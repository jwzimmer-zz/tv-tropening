<p>The <em>Spellsinger</em> series is a fantasy series written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster">Alan Dean Foster</a>.</p><p>In the first book, <em>Spellsinger</em>, the hero Jonathan Thomas Meriweather, also known as Jon-Tom, is a prelaw student with pretentions to rock stardom, who is innocently smoking pot when he's abruptly transported from the University of California at Los Angeles to a weird world in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LionsAndTigersAndHumansOhMy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LionsAndTigersAndHumansOhMy">animals talk, wear clothing, and live alongside humans</a> by the turtle wizard Clothahump, who was searching for a great wizardly "En'geeniar" (meaning an engineer, as he was under the impression that this is the name our world gives to wizards). Unfortunately, he caught Jon-Tom, a law student and would-be rock star who works part-time as a janitor and on his pay stubs is called a "sanitation engineer"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08zfm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note08zfm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08zfm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and his mind was "the most receptive" at the moment, which might have had to do with that joint he smoked</span>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>It all works out for the best, though, as Jon-Tom soon discovers that in the magical world he has the power of a spellsinger: a wizard who can make powerful magic through music. Using this new-found power, he and a cast of creatures set out to do battle with the evil anthropomorphic insects known as the Plated Folk.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>Spellsinger</em> provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming">Accidental Misnaming</a>: Mudge can never get the name of Strelakat Mews right.

All that is known about its inhabitants is that, like some ancient or primitive Earth cultures, they seemed to dislike or fear having images of themselves included in their artwork.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">Ignored Epiphany</a>: Invariably, whenever something bad happens to Mudge, he will either forget the lesson he learned from it the next time a similar situation shows up, or he'll have an epiphany and swear to change his ways which he ends up dismissing/abandoning a short time later. Or it will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> and the Aesop will be subverted or broken by Mudge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a> about what he was supposed to learn.

A young beautiful flirtatious otter princess, reverts him back to his old ways.

Very unfortunate, since he is a very good student in the rare times he's actually sober. On the other hand, his alcoholism actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">comes in handy</a> in book five, since he's so used to seeing the world through a distorted, hallucinogenic lens that the permabulator's reality tweaks don't faze him, letting him be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> when things go wonky. Though in book seven, he is replaced by a much more competent owl. Which makes sense as Clothahump was at the end of his rope with him by book five; he would never be able to keep his sanity if Sorbl stayed for eighteen years. Then again the end of the sixth book hints that he gave up alcohol for good.<ul><li> This also applies to Mudge, as he is eager to have a drink to the point where it puts his health at risk (as noted in Day of Dissonance).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGuysWantCheerleaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGuysWantCheerleaders">All Guys Want Cheerleaders</a>: Flores, whom Jon-Tom had a crush on back at UCLA.

Luckily, the altered birds get a real kick out of their new makeovers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">Amazonian Beauty</a>: Subverted with Roseroar. Jon-Tom and Mudge both tell her how attractive they think she is because she's twice the size of both of them put together and they're terrified of making her angry. Though she isn't explicitly unattractive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Amplifier Artifact</a>: Jon-Tom's dual-necked, guitar-like duar is sometimes this, sometimes not. In the first few novels, it's implied that duars are fairly common instruments in the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> setting (in the first book, Jon-Tom picks his up from a sack of musical instruments dropped by a fleeing merchant, and his companions act as if it's a common item), and it merely functions as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">focal point</a> for his latent magical powers. In later novels, however, it's indicated that the magic comes from the duar <em>itself</em>, which has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into a rare and valuable item, and Jon-Tom's facility with it is more practice than anything else. Considering some of the world-shaking effects Jon-Tom achieves with his duar in the first few books, however, it's conceivable that the instrument <em>became</em> magically-empowered as a result of these events. At least one of his feats, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the summoning of M'nemaxa</span>, can be performed only once in a wizard's lifetime, which would explain why he can't just repeat the process to enchant another duar.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>: The later books seem to imply the Wizard's World is slowly becoming one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As Jon-Tom gradually brings over his world's technology and influences, for example Mudge's kids grew up watching Disney movies and Anime and being fans of rap</span> in fact the seventh book, can be seen as a rather interesting (pretend) psychology study on how multiple kids growing up in a fantasy world are raised on our technology and pop culture influences.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge">And Call Him "George"!</a>: The Brulumpus, a sort of sentient swamp from <em>The Moment of the Magician</em>. All it wanted was companionship that was "new and interesting". In order to coax it to let them leave, Jon-Tom conjures up a variety of objects from his own world such as a grandfather clock or a flea circus to entertain it, and eventually it is overcome by...TV commercials.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>: Jon-Tom when he's captured by the underwater Plated Folk colony in the fourth book. His captors need to carry him back alive and whole to their homeland <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">to answer for his crimes</a>, but they don't dare give him the slightest chance to work his magic.

Jon-Tom is willing to risk it regardless.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes">Animal Stereotypes</a>: Appears everywhere, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox">clever foxes</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">villainous cats</a> to sex-crazed otters to temperamental badgers to evil insects. But a particularly prominent example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of book five, a wolverine...who is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> wizard who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">abandoned his people</a> because they in turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">would not accept him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">for being a coward</a>&mdash;and this is actually suggested as the <em>reason</em> he is insane, that being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> and fierce fighters is so in the nature of wolverines that his mind could not handle him being a coward. As a result, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery">wants to make the whole world insane like him, even if the being he uses to do it also destroys creation</a>. When the departure of the perambulator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">cures his insanity</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">he then still ends up trying to kill the heroes</a>&mdash;partly because by freeing it Jon-Tom took away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood">something he was actually enjoying</a> that made him unique and powerful in his opinion, and partly because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> tendency of wolverines.<ul><li> Subversions do exist, however. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">The Weavers</a> of Gossameringue, despite their fearsome appearance, turn out to be loyal and dependable allies; Colin the koala, far from being somnolent, lethargic, and slow of mind is a badass warrior and runecaster; and Dormas the hinny, while a bit stubborn, is also one of the calmest and most sensible members of the party. Also, the guinea pig who leads the group of thieves that try to rob Clothahump in <em>Time of the Transference</em> is anything but cute and harmless.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a>: Or possibly Animorphic Personification. Or something in between. Either way, Gyrnaught is evidently the Personification of the Nazi <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reichsadler.svg">Iron Eagle symbol<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics">Antiquated Linguistics</a>: For some reason, the magical items which Jon-Tom and the others find in the Lost City all speak in this way.

And he's right to some extent - for five books he gets constantly dragged or outright forced into misadventures he doesn't care about and often accompanied by people who hardly care about him (even Jon-Tom sees him more as a "hired" guide than a friend for a long time), and whenever it is time for someone to be humiliated for comedic purposes on these misadventures that's usually him.

However, since mice are considered quite sentient in this world and the suggestion of eating any sentient being fills anyone but the most evil with disgust and horror, it's more likely Jon-Tom only caught a glimpse of something mouse-sized with a long tail in the frying pan, and subconsciously <em>assumed</em> it was a mouse for the same reason. In which case, it was probably a small long-tailed lizard. Indeed, a mouse from the Warmlands would probably be much too big for Sorbl to swallow, and in the scene where he first meets Sorbl in <em>Day of the Dissonance</em>, the owl a) is horrified at the idea of eating mice and b) specifically mentions going to find some lizards to eat.</li><li> <em>Son of Spellsinger</em> suggests that even the now-civilized Warmlander carnivores used to prey on the others, but gave that up around the dawn of history, at the same time they started walking upright.

As well as Clothahump on the cover is wearing a ridiculous looking wizard's hat, he is never shown wearing any hats ever and if he did, it wouldn't be one that goofy looking.</li><li> Book three has Roseroar on the cover.
