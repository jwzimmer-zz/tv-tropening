Lori believes the tales are entirely made up and cherishes them as pleasant childhood memories (much as she cherishes her old stuffed rabbit Reginald). Recently divorced, short on money and employment, Lori's life is drastically altered when she learns that Dimity Westwood was a real person <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance">who recently died and left Lori a bequest of $10,000</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition">condition</a> is a request that Lori go to Dimity's old home (a honey-coloured stone cottage near the village of Finch, said to be in the Cotswolds), search through Dimity's decades-long correspondence with Lori's mother, and write an introduction to a soon-to-be-published collection of the "Aunt Dimity" stories. Through the cache of letters, Lori finds out more about the life her mother lived in London during WWII when she became friends with Dimity during their wartime service.

Lori speaks to the open diary, and Dimity's half of their conversations appears on the pages in her old-fashioned copperplate handwriting. After the initial investigation to satisfy the terms of the will, Dimity continues to be available to Lori via the blue journal, allowing Dimity to keep abreast of events in her village and in Lori's life.

Lori checks out their story, convinced they saw someone, and finds footprints and a scrap of red silk the riding instructor missed. It turns out to be<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Charlotte DuCaral, a neighbour who wears the cloak, along with zinc oxide sun block and red lipstick, who was in the woods brooding over her lost love, who promised to elope with her years before but didn't arrive</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndOrEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndOrEve">Adam and/or Eve</a>: Adam Chase, the handsome military historian Lori meets in <em>Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil</em>, could be said to be "from the ground": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the grandson of Claire Byrd, the ghost of Wyrdhurst Hall</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: Once Lori becomes a parent, these sorts of fears start to figure into her reactions. This gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">humourous treatment</a> when she's an overprotective new mom, but it also drives her more serious investigation of the possible pedophile in <em>Aunt Dimity: Vampire Hunter</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeAntechamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeAntechamber">Afterlife Antechamber</a>: Aunt Dimity seems to occupy an area like this, especially when she's communicating with Lori. In some instances, notably in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Deep Blue Sea</em>, she writes of making inquiries among other spirits who have passed beyond, giving the impression that said spirits aren't immediately available for consultation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesop">standards</a> get covered, and generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAesop">more than one person learns something</a> in the course of each book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a>: Lori's secondhand Morris Mini, which she retains for a time despite having sufficient wealth to replace it with something much flashier. She even gets a second one later, in addition to the silver Mercedes and the yellow Range Rover, which she uses for short trips without the twins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenDrivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenDrivers">her poor driving</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: William Arthur Willis (Senior and Junior), Sir Williston Willis, Wendy Walker, Sir Percy Pelham, Deirdre and Declan Donovan, Tony Thames, Lady Barbara Booker and Mikhail Markov.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsLikePonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsLikePonies">All Girls Like Ponies</a>: Nell Harris first learned to ride on a visit to some of the English Willises in Yorkshire. She expertly drops hints and gets a horse for her birthday (named Rocinante). Later, her parents Derek and Emma Harris start a riding school. This comes in handy, since Lori's sons Will and Rob also grow to be horse-mad (parodied/gender-inverted/take your pick). Another of the Harrises' early pupils is Chloe, the daughter of a widow for whom Lori tries her hand at matchmaking in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Next of Kin</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">Amateur Sleuth</a>: Lori is this, as is (was) Dimity. Lori has some knowledge of old books and manuscripts (which does come in handy from time to time), but she inherited a fortune from Dimity and so no longer must work for a living. When not sleuthing, she oversees a charitable foundation and keeps house for her husband and sons. In life, Dimity wasn't a sleuth either; she did clerical work during the war, volunteered at a daycare centre for war widows and their children, and ran her charitable foundation&mdash;when she wasn't gardening or writing letters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>: Grant and Charles aren't mentioned as gay, but they show all the signs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysCamp">Their careers are in the art world, specifically in restoration, framing, and appraisals.</a> On first moving to their cottage in Finch, they compete in the village flower show and win. They have a pair of small pet dogs named for artists. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysLoveTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysLoveTheater">They routinely go to London for the theatre.</a> They're just as much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens">Gossipy Hens</a> as any of their neighbours; they share a table with Lori at Sally Pyne's cafe to watch Amelia move into her cottage.

To that end, he encourages the residents to attend in costume, and lets it be known that anything vaguely like medieval- or Renaissance-era clothing will do. Lori and her neighbours quickly get in the spirit, doing library research, taking one of Sally Pyne's sewing classes, or hiring costumes from a theatrical supplier. Even Bill dons an ensemble from Calvin's stores that he calls a "cool medieval dude" outfit; Lori is particularly taken with the way he fills his tights.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a>: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Denouement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Denouement">d&eacute;nouement</a> of <em>Aunt Dimity Takes a Holiday</em>, Derek's cousin Simon and his father father finally tell him that his mother died of cancer, and that she wanted it kept from him (Derek was seven at the time) because the disease and its treatment had a drastic effect on her appearance.

In other portions, tragic and horrific elements appear, and the answers (e.g. terrorism, suicide, survivor's guilt, murder) are far more grim. Interestingly, the opposites tend to reinforce one another: Characters can take things so seriously that they jump to dire conclusions that are dispelled by relatively innocuous explanations, and everyone has a good laugh afterwards. Alternatively, they can go blithely forward in a misplaced confidence that nothing bad will happen, until something does.

The place also has a variety of luxuries (sauna, hot tub, arcade game room, outdoor firepit, indoor fireplaces, and so on). One of the characters calls it the owner's treehouse, explicitly stating that he was forbidden a treehouse while growing up and used his wealth as an adult to live the dream.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Cool Old Lady</a>: Lady Barbara Booker in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince</em>.

The villagers' reactions to the news that Lori and her family had a collapsed vagrant airlifted to hospital range from incredulity to hostility. Lori herself also recounts how she is often uncomfortable when confronted by homeless people (having so nearly been one herself); of the villagers, she says, "I was the last person on earth qualified to judge my neighbors. I had too much in common with them." Lori and Fr. Bright also have an argument over the man's sanity, especially as the evidence of his recent past suggests he has done highly unusual things and may have been committed to a psychiatric hospital; the priest later admits, "Where there was goodness, I chose to see madness."

In some cases, coping with the fallout occurs over an extended period (often carrying over from one book to the next). The fates of other, more minor characters are addressed in the epilogue that closes each novel; they typically go about rebuilding their lives, and are usually better off after all is revealed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayHurtsDarkAdjustedEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayHurtsDarkAdjustedEyes">Day Hurts Dark-Adjusted Eyes</a>: Lori uses this to her advantage in <em>Aunt Dimity: Snowbound</em>.

Sir Williston's widow ordered her elder son to kill Sybella and had her younger son drugged, bound and taken aboard a ship headed for the American colonies. Mother and son took possession of Sybella's property and faked documents to paper over their theft. The elder son disinterred Sybella's coffin after his mother's death and the remains, together with a journal of his conversations with the dead Sybella, was passed from father to eldest son for some three hundred years.</span> Willis Sr. promises to arrange for the remains to be buried with her husband in the American Willises' family plot in Boston.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadManWriting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadManWriting">Dead Man Writing</a>: Often about unfinished business, even if only indirectly.<ul><li> After Willis Sr. is sure of Lori's identity, he gives Lori two letters, one from Aunt Dimity and one from her mother.

Occasionally, it will be attached to a minor character with actual lines, such as Rev. and Mrs. Shutttleworth of Penford Harbour in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Duke</em>. It was also the name of an inn in Salisbury that Lori had once visited, and which she used as part of her cover story for Simon's visit to the hospital in <em>Aunt Dimity Takes a Holiday</em>. Most often, it is someone no longer on the scene due to death, or someone never seen yet referenced because they perform some plot function. Two of the references are from Finch (and possibly the same person), a Miss Shuttleworth once ran the village tea room, and Dimity names a Patricia Shuttleworth whose dog's unlikely victory in the local dog show caused a "kerfluffle". The same Shuttleworth (an art teacher in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping) is mentioned in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Family Tree</em> and <em>Aunt Dimity and the Village Witch</em>. The name also appears on the tombstones of a family that died in an epidemic in Bluebird, Colorado; as one of Bill's clients whose demands keep him in London; as the pseudonym Sir Percy Pelham used to scout out Erinskil before his purchase of his island castle; and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mr. Barlow's Whitby informant on Prunella Hooper and Peggy Kitchen's secret son</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOFGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOFGod">According to the author</a>, the references pay tribute to a real Mrs. Shuttleworth, who wrote the first fan letter the author received, putting her effusive praise on embossed stationery no less.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiseaseBleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiseaseBleach">Disease Bleach</a>: Kit Smith's hair is noted as prematurely grey (he's only around thirty when he is introduced in <em>Aunt Dimity's Christmas</em>); he spent years living as a vagrant and nearly died of a combination of hypothermia and pneumonia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>: Aside from the meta-example of "Harry Peters":<ul><li> Lori is struck by waves of <em>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</em> when she goes to Bluebird, Colorado: many of the locals resemble her neighbours in Finch, down to similar-sounding names.</li><li> At the close of one of their conversations on Mistress Meg Redfern in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Village Witch</em>:</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>You've grown fond of Mistress Meg, haven't you?</em> <br>"Yes, I have," I said. <br><em>I can understand why.

There are many references to this, including a jocular reference to the "law" that grandparents must spoil their grandchildren and being an attorney, Willis Sr. is stickler for obeying the law. He refurbishes the stables at Fairworth House not for his own use (he doesn't ride himself), but so that the twins will ride over for frequent visits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake">Double Take</a>: Another way Lori often wears her heart on her sleeve in an amusing way. Notably, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the ghost of Cyril Pennyfeather</span> wrote in the blue journal for the first time: "I glanced down at the journal, did a double take that nearly sent Reginald flying, and lowered my arm very slowly."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToVillainy">Driven to Villainy</a>: In <em>Aunt Dimity Goes West</em>, it is revealed that an infamous local mine disaster was due to sabotage caused by a disgruntled employee who had owned the claim originally, sold it for a relative pittance ($5,000.00 in the 1860s), and later learned it contained a rich vein of gold (worth over $200 million by the 1890s!). It also turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wife committed suicide, his son was sent to an orphanage, and his great-grandson later reopened the mine and set a bomb in it to destroy the house built on the site by the owner's descendants</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingTattoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingTattoo">Embarrassing Tattoo</a>: Refreshingly averted by the Pym sisters when they finally meet their great-grandniece Bree. They mention having seen tattoos on a sailor and a male farmhand, and while they express curiosity to see them on a young woman, they give no hint of condemnation of the practice. They are also familiar with the Maori cultural influence on New Zealand. After a bit of coaxing, Bree does push up her sleeves to show them, and she tells them about the morepork owl on her left shoulder. Ruth and Louise also recognize the specific flowers (bamboo orchid, red mistletoe and white tea tree blossoms) she has on her arms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnglishRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnglishRose">English Rose</a>: "A somewhat distant and distaff twig of the [Penford] family tree, but a twig nonetheless", Susannah Ashley-Woods was a fashion model known as "Ashers, the English Rose", effectively trading on this trope. Not that she quite lives up to the ideal; explaining her ill-manners, the duke says of her, "She was raised by wolves, you know." She's rude to Emma particularly, since she makes a play for Derek Harris and sees Emma as a rival. She also proves to be nursing a grudge: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her father was ruined financially after taking investing advice from Grayson's father and killed himself</span>, and Susannah invites herself to Penford Hall and twits Grayson over his involvement with Lex Rex in revenge. It is only after she's assaulted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by a hero-worshipping housemaid who dreams of being a fashion designer</span> that she reverts to the good manners associated with this trope; it also helps that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Grayson offers her rooms in Penford Hall and her manager facilitates a business arrangement with Nanny Cole and the housemaid designer</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong">Entertainingly Wrong</a>: Many of the plots resolve themselves in this way. Lori was right to suspect someone was in the woods in <em>Aunt Dimity: Vampire Hunter</em>, but it wasn't a vampire or a pedophile, it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a neighbour with a sun allergy thinking about a lost love</span>.

When an archaeologist starts a dig on church land and takes over the local hall for his specimens, a civil war brews between supporters of the project, led by Sally Pyne (who redecorates her tearoom in Roman motifs) and opponents, led by Peggy Kitchen (who hands out a series of flyers against the dig and starts a petition to the local bishop to send the dig team packing). Apart from a scheduling conflict with the village fete, the biggest question seems to be whether the dig and the potential tourism it might generate will be a boon or a bust for the residents.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExhaustedEyeBags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExhaustedEyeBags">Exhausted Eye Bags</a>: The image appears a few times in the series, when a character is tired due to stress.

Lori refuses to carry it to Grant's car because she doesn't want it to soil her lovely dress. Willis Sr. pays her a courtly compliment on said dress, Lori thanks him, and then: "I curtseyed in a ladylike manner, then hiked up my lovely dress and set off for the entrance hall at a distinctly unladylike jog."</li></ul><p></p></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropes F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyBusiness">Family Business</a>: The law firm of Willis and Willis is run in Boston by William Willis Sr. and his son Bill. The English branch of the family also runs a law firm in London, and Willis Sr. initiates a plan to combine the two.

Many of the residents of Finch are devoted amateur gardeners, and gardening and flowers are frequent plot points. A partial list:<ul><li> Dimity's favourite flowers are white lilacs, which according to some sources stand for youthful innocence and memories. Some of them grow at her cottage, and bouquets of them (<em>sans</em> cards) appear at weddings, funerals, and other special occasions both before and after her death. The twins' first nanny Francesca is welcomed by the scent of white lilacs in the cottage.</li><li> The cottage is also covered in ivy (particularly outside the study where Lori keeps the glue journal), which is variously described in the sources as referring to friendship, matrimonial bonds, and dependence.</li><li> Early in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Duke</em>, Emma Porter is an American amateur gardener who is taking a tour of English gardens after a decade-plus relationship ends. She meets the Pym sisters at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HedgeMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HedgeMaze">garden maze</a>, and has a lengthy conversation with them on the subject, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not realizing that it was a job interview of sorts</span>. She takes their card and their suggestion to visit the gardens at Penford Hall, and is soon tasked with restoring a walled garden on the estate. She also finds her personal life sorted out as well.</li><li> Lori's favourite flowers are blue irises. She is astonished to find a vase of them on a coffee table in the Willises' Boston parlour (in a cold and slushy early April) the day after she first met the attorneys. Irises are associated with the Greek messenger goddess of the same name, and blue irises specifically stand for faith and hope.</li><li> The unkempt vicarage garden is a problem in <em>Aunt Dimity Digs In</em>, not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cover for a burglar</span>. Emma Harris takes the place in hand, with an ebullient eight-year-old Rainey Dawson to assist her. The cleanup provides a clue to one of the minor mysteries of the book.</li><li> Later on in the same book, Rainey has an arrangement of orange lilies to surround her stuffed tiger for a local contest until she causes a mishap that knocks over the vase. Not only do the orange flowers go well with the tiger, the flowers mean passion.</li><li> The weeping willows around the village war memorial (symbolizing mourning) are replaced with holly (meaning foresight and/or domestic happiness).</li><li> Miranda Morrow has a garden chaotically filled with unusual plants that other gardeners might term weeds (including references to marijuana, though nothing is proven). Miranda is an independent-minded sort (the village's only known practising Wiccan) who prepares medicinal poultices, teas and infusions.</li><li> The Pym sisters are associated with lavender (meaning variously serenity, grace, calmness, devotion or distrust); the scent of lavender water permeates their cottage.</li><li> When we finally meet Bree Pym in <em>Aunt Dimity Down Under</em>, she's wearing a greenstone pendant in the shape of a koru (an opening fern frond), and when she finally rises from her seat to leave the park with Lori, she "unfolded like an opening fern frond". Bree also has several flower tattoos: bamboo orchid, red mistletoe and white tea tree blossoms</li><li> Willis Sr. eventually retires and moves to an old estate near Finch. He cultivates orchids in his greenhouse, just as he had in the hothouse of his Boston home. Orchids are symbolic of refined beauty, and Willis sr. is nothing if not refined.</li><li> A botanical artist of great renown features in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Village Witch</em>. A subplot turns on a particular painting of hers (a spring crocus symbolizing youthful gladness) and the language of flowers, and the exposition of its meaning fills in some of Willis Sr.'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted">A Fool and His New Money Are Soon Parted</a>: According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">background of Aubrey Pym</a>, after he was turned out of the family home with the clothes on his back, he emigrated to New Zealand, married into money, lost his beloved wife in childbirth, took to drinking and lost much of his fortune.

Lori also describes Nicholas' interrogation technique as good cop/bad cop in one conversation with Dimity, and the local witch makes coy remarks to him about inviting the drug squad to tea at her house. It's later revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is in fact a police detective</span>.</li><li> Early in <em>Aunt Dimity Goes West</em>, Bill marshals many arguments to convince Lori to vacation in Colorado with the boys and Annelise; among them, he cites the many wonderful activities available to the boys and says, "They'll have a tale or two to tell their friends when they start school in the fall, that's for sure." Yes, and some of those tales will prove more exciting than even he bargained for&#151;so exciting that they prompt the school's headmistress to summon Bill and Lori for a conference early in <em>Aunt Dimity Vampire Hunter</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>: Bree Pym proves to be this in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince</em>.

A partial list:<ul><li> Lori's childhood pal is Reginald, the pink flannel rabbit with the grape juice stain on his face (Lori says he tried her grape juice once and spat it out). Sadly, he was shredded when her apartment was burglarised, and Lori kept his remains in a shoe box, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aunt Dimity magically repaired him</span>. Reginald sometimes assists Dimity in drawing Lori's attention to things or prompting characters to go to specific places.</li><li> In <em>Aunt Dimity and the Duke</em>, the six-year-old Nell Harris carries around a stuffed bear she refers to as "Bertie," who has aspects of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">a security blanket</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">an imaginary friend</a>.

On unwrapping her present, Rainey announces, "Edmund Terrance. His name is Edmund Terrance."</li><li> Major Ted, a stuffed bear in a British officer's uniform who once belonged to the daughter of the house at an old Northumberland estate, features in <em>Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil</em>.</li><li> The epilogue of <em>Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince</em> describes a photo of young Daisy Pickering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with her reunited parents in Australia</span> holding a koala bear.</li><li> In <em>Aunt Dimity and the Summer King</em>, Hargreaves' granddaughter Harriet gives a stuffed unicorn to Lori's infant daughter Bess. It joins Reginald on the library shelf until Bess is a little older.</li><li> Elderly retired attorney Thomas Willis (Gerald's father) enjoys the company of a well-worn giraffe named Geraldine in <em>Aunt Dimity's Good Deed</em>, and Kit Smith has a stuffed horse named Lancaster after the real horse he had to give up when his family moved to London from the country. Like Lori herself, both received their companions as gifts from Dimity.</li><li> Rob and Will get a series of themed stuffed animals (matching, of course): baby seal pups from Peter Harris and his girlfriend Cassie, buffalo in Colorado, dragons from King Wilfrid's Faire, kiwis from Lori's trip to New Zealand, bats from Charlotte DuCaral. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Donovans' Aunt Augusta</span> anonymously bestows her stuffed lamb (yet another gift from Dimity) on Willis Sr., who names him Frederick after the author of <em>Notes on Sheep</em>, a copy of which was found among the items hidden in the stables.</li><li> In <em>Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince</em>, Lady Barbara personally returns Mikhail's Cossack-shirted teddy bear to him.</li><li> In <em>Aunt Dimity and the Buried Treasure</em>, when Lori finally meets the man Dimity knew only as "Badger", she sees on his desk the stuffed badger Dimity once gave him "as a silly gift, a small token of my gratitude for the many wonderful hours we'd spent together."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSamaritan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSamaritan">Good Samaritan</a>: Lori and her family play the Good Samaritan to the man they find collapsed in their driveway at the beginning of <em>Aunt Dimity's Christmas</em>; Willis Sr. even calls out an RAF helicopter to airlift the man to hospital when the roads are blocked by snow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens">Gossipy Hens</a>: Much of the population of Finch could fall into this category.

In <em>Aunt Dimity's Good Deed</em>, she disguises herself as a French girl who is Willis Sr.'s ward and speaks French as a part of the cover, getting information from locals about Gerald Willis. Years later, she falls for Kit Smith, then her father's stable master and twice her age (She's 16, he's 32). He doesn't want to take advantage of her youth and tells her so, but he sneaks into her grandfather's estate to see her after her riding accident in <em>Aunt Dimity Takes a Holiday</em>. When he goes to leave her bedside, he says, "I...I should go. Good-bye, Nell." She replies, "<em>Au revoir</em>, Kit." The French phrase can be literally translated as, "until our next meeting," making it clear she still loves him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a>: In <em>Aunt Dimity Digs In</em>, the Peacocks have a new sign painted for their pub, depicting two faces on a dark background: "One face was slightly larger than the other, but apart from that, they were identical: hairless, triangular, and delicate, with enormous eyes, plug holes for nostrils, and thin slits for mouths.

Certain things may be deduced from the books, however.<ul><li> Dimity seems to adhere to the rule about ghosts haunting a certain place (her cottage), yet she is also deeply associated with her journal, to the point that she can travel with another character if the journal does. Lori helps her uphold this rule in <em>Aunt Dimity Digs In</em> by taking the journal to the Harvest Festival, including the unveiling of the renovated war memorial <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Piero Sciaparelli's name added to the roster</span>.</li><li> Dimity is not omniscient; Lori must tell her (via the journal) about the events she witnesses and the things she does.

Thus, the secret is easily maintained (anyone else who opens the journal thinks it's blank), and there's no limit on the number of conversations Dimity can have.</li><li> Dimity seems to be in some sort of stopover or holding area in the after life. Aside from joining with her beloved Bobby for a time, she expresses a willingness to remain as she is, so as to be available to advise Lori.

When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ghost of Claire Byrd possesses Lori</span> in <em>Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil</em>, Dimity confirms this: "<em>Your relationship with me has made you vulnerable. Once the door is opened between the living and the dead, there's no telling who will come through. We're not all of us charming, sensible, and sane, you know.

When Lori asks her about the ghostly lights she sees in <em>Aunt Dimity and the Deep Blue Sea</em>, Dimity agrees to "make inquiries" and find out if either Brother Cieran or the tenth Earl of Strathcairn is responsible. There are limits, however; when Lori suggests asking Prunella Hooper directly about her death, Dimity says,</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>"With all due modesty, my dear, I very much doubt that Mrs. Hooper and I are in the same place.

In <em>Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince</em>, Gracie Thames notes that she and her husband named three of their children for family members who were killed by the Nazis when Germany invaded the Soviet Union.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookLikeYouveSeenAGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookLikeYouveSeenAGhost">You Look Like You've Seen a Ghost</a>: Just after the first time Dimity uses the journal to communicate directly with Lori, Bill starts to say this and Lori cuts him off.
