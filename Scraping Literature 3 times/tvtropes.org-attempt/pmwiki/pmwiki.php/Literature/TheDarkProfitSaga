Zachary Pike, currently consisting of <em>Orconomics: A Satire</em> (2014) and <em>Son of a Liche</em> (2018). In preparation for the release of <em>Son of a Liche</em>, the author has also sent the short story "The Monster Below", which is also a part of this setting, to everyone pre-ordering the second novel.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The novels' setting is the fantasy world of Arth, which is described as "a world much like our own but with more magic and fewer vowels." It's a mostly standard fantasy setting with a modern understanding of economics. A sizable chunk (as in 40%) of the economy of the Freedlands is based on the activities of the Heroes' Guild, who send out adventurers on quests and bring back loot from slain foes (or rather, F.O.E.'s, which stands for "Forces of Evil"). The loot is then assessed and split up between the interested parties (i.e. investors). Additionally, shares of the loot are bundled with shares of other loots and repackaged as new commodities to be sold on the market. There's also a bustling service industry catering to adventurers, including gear suppliers, innkeepers, healers, enchanters, potion merchants, etc. There is, of course, a large dose of risk, both personal (for adventurers) and financial (for investors). After all, no one knows for sure the value of loot a particular F.O.E. might possess. And, of course, a good percentage of adventurers don't survive their first year on the job, and many veterans burn out or become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">salve-heads</a> (people addicted to healing salves, and who deliberately injure themselves just to get more). The various races of Arth are typically divided into the races of Man (the standard "good" races: humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Gnomes), the Shadowkin (the "cursed" races: Orcs, Goblins, Nagas, Trolls, etc.), and a myriad of monster races (e.g. Ogres, Lizardmen).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Gorm Ingerson is a Dwarf and a former adventurer, spending his days passed out drunk in one ditch or another. Then he saves the life of a Goblin he names Gleebek and gets "strongly encouraged" to join a holy quest by the followers of the goddess Al'Matra along with a group of misfits in order to wipe his slate clean. The alternative is to have the Heroes' Guild hang him for desertion (Guild rules say that all of their adventurers succeed or die trying; the rule is strictly enforced, even if they have to ensure the "die trying" portion by hanging any deserters) with Gleebek's status as an NPC (Noncombatant Paper Carrier) revoked through guilt by association. So, Gorm (along with Gleebek as his squire) has to become one of the Seven Heroes, along with an Al'Matran scribe who thinks he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Seventh Hero</a>, a thief-turned-bard/skirt-chaser, a pair of wizards who constantly bicker and engage in destructive duels, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMute">Elective Mute</a> former adventurer with PTSD, and a has-been Elf ranger who, like Gorm, likes to spend her days passed-out drunk.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The first book, <em>Orconomics</em>, was published in 2014. A sequel, <em>Son of Liche</em>, was published in 2018 and features Gorm and his band of disgraced heroes trying to win back the trust of the orcs they betrayed while trying to sell an effective counter-pitch against a liche's attempts to sell a city-state on the benefits of becoming an undead thrall. The author is currently working on the third and final novel titled <em>Dragonfired</em>.</p><p>As part of a promotion for <em>Son of a Liche</em>, the author has offered a free short story titled "The Monster Below" (as well as other goodies, such as a detailed map of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubCity">Andarun</a>), set in the same world, to anyone pre-ordering the book.</p><p>There is also <em>A Song of Three Spirits</em>, which is the Arth version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> with Fenrir Goldson playing the part of Scrooge.</p><p>The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jzacharypike.com/arth/index.html">author's website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> features a section on the world of Arth, written by the people he cooperated with on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> the setting, which includes blog entries describing some of the races, clans, and organizations. There are also some pictures of the protagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executives</a>, and others.</p><p></p><hr><h2> The series contains examples of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade">Absurdly Sharp Blade</a>: The Orc tribe encountered by the party has a factory dedicated to producing Vorpal Swords. Everyone is disappointed, since the marketing for the blades indicates that they're actually forged by an old sword master on top of a secluded mountain. In fact, the whole process is done on the assembly line with even the rare ingredients supplied by efficient means. They also produce their own weapons, which are, apparently, superior to those sold by the races of Man. It's just that they don't yet have enough of a market penetration, so they sell them dirt-cheap.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming">Accidental Misnaming</a>: After first saving the Goblin, Gorm asks for his name. The first word he hears in reply is "Gleebek", deciding to call the Goblin by this name. Much later, they end up in an Orc city, and Gleebek starts speaking to the Orc chief in the Shadowtongue (which no one else in the party understands), while Gorm shouts for Gleebek to stop. The Orc idly wonders why the Dwarf is calling the Goblin "Hello". The Goblin, whose real name is Tib'rin, explains that Gorm doesn't speak Shadowtongue, so he simply assumed that "Gleebek" was a name instead of a greeting. Gorm feels a little foolish, when another bilingual Orc clears up the misunderstanding. Earlier, Tib'rin is shown slowly learning some Imperial and actually tries to correct Gorm on the name, telling him that "Gleebek is 'hello'", only for Gorm to assume his grammar needs work. In fact, it becomes clear why he keeps repeating "Gleebek" every time someone mentions his (mistaken) name: he assumes they're greeting him, so he says "hello" back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">Alcohol-Induced Idiocy</a>: Kaitha signs up for the quest while being drunk. The next morning, she tries to get her agent out of it, only for the agent to drop her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAreEqualInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAreEqualInDeath">All Are Equal in Death</a>: Mordo Ogg gives no special treatment for anyone, hence his shortage of clerics, everybody gets one visit from the god of Death.<ul><li> The Head of Marketing workshops this as a recruiting slogan, but the focus group point out that it's blatantly untrue for undead who are anything but created equal. It also gets them wondering what kind of undead Tyren, Detarr Ur'Mayan's right-hand-skeleton, really is.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a>: They are if you're an NPC. One can lose his or her noncombatant papers for the slightest offence. In the second book, a Gnoll is mentioned to have his taken away for <em>jaywalking</em>. As soon as they lose their papers, Shadowkin and monsters automatically become fair game to anyone who wants to take their property as loot. It's not uncommon for the same bannermen who take away a Shadowkin's papers to kill him or her on the spot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">All Trolls Are Different</a>: Trolls are large ape-like Shadowkin who, despite their size, are incredibly stealthy. They can also compress themselves into the size and shape of an ordinary boulder. When the party goes into the Mirewood, they are told by a local innkeeper that some travelers through the dangerous forest are protected by the so-called "King in the Wood", with the payment for his protection being any type of purple-colored trinket. Gorm later accidentally encounters the "King" and discovers that it's a Troll. The Troll kidnaps him and then asks to secretly join the party, keeping out of sight of the other members. He promises to protect the party from various dangers (including any monstrous creatures, who, like all animals, are naturally afraid of Trolls). According to legend, Trolls are Sten, who were corrupted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Mannon</a> into a shadow of their former selves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">Alternative Calendar</a>: The world of Arth goes by a different (although similar) calendar than we do. A year on Arth is not a perfect 361 days. It consists of twelve months of 30 days each plus Mordo Ogg's day - first day of winter (or summer in the South). All months are officially named after gods, but most people use common names, typically associated with farming (for example, the eighth month is formally called Maeneth, while its common name is Harvestgild). Every three or four years, Agekeepers declare a Dark Year (sort of like our leap year), which extends Mordo Ogg to a whole week (weeks are still seven days) to correct the calendar. Additionally, the history of Arth is divided into Ages. They're marked by significant events rather than length. <em>Orconomics</em> is set in year 373 of the seventh age, called the Age of Heroes. A year is typically written as [age].[year] (e.g. 7.373).

Reading the paper triggers the rune. It's a single-use item and has a fairly short range. It does, however, completely negate any spell, enchantment, or shapeshifter disguise in the area. The effect wears off in less than a minute but can prove crucial in battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Heraldin uses one during the fight with Flynn's assassins, resulting in the partly learning that Gaist is a Doppelganger. When Heraldin surrenders himself to Benny Hookhand, he uses sleight of hand to hold one of the runes in the hand not gripping the hook. When the confused Benny glances at the piece of paper, it triggers the rune and temporarily knocks Benny out, allowing Heraldin to toss the hook into the river.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheApprentice">The Apprentice</a>: Laruna is still ranked as an apprentice, although most of the members of the Academic Council of Mages have already voted to make her a full mage. Jynn is the only one who thinks she needs more control before becoming a mage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is eventually impressed enough with her skills to give her his vote, causing her robes to instantly grow more ornate, signifying her new status</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: Both Johan and Detarr Ur'Mayan see each other as their arch-nemesis, what with Johan already killing Ur'Mayan once. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They have a climactic duel near the end of the second book, although Johan ends up losing that one. The only reason he survives is because of Jynn's interference.</span> It's implied that Gorm and Johan are heading in that direction and will come to a head in the third and final book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Archmage</a>: The top wizards of both the Order of the Sun (solamancy) and Order of the Moon (noctomancy) are classified as archmages, and their robes automatically reflect their status. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the second novel, Jynn fully embraces his omnimancy and defeats his father Detarr Ur'Mayan, becoming an omnimancer archmage in the process.

While Detarr is initially the stronger and nearly kill Jynn, intending to turn him into his undead assistant, Jynn makes full use of his omnimancy power, long denied to him, and utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomps</a> his father, becoming an omnimancer archmage in the process</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfLawyers">Army of Lawyers</a>: The Lawyer-monks of the Order of Adchul are so good at their job that they once saved a town from flooding by "drafting a cease-and-desist letter" to a <em>river</em>. There are also rumors of them successfully filing a motion with the gods to claim a sizable chunk of a dead priest's eternal reward. That's a lesson that not even death will keep someone from having to pay the piper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfTheDead">Army of the Dead</a>: In the second book, necromancer-turned-liche Detarr Ur'Mayan raises an army of various kinds of undead and starts moving through Ruskan and the Freedlands, destroying towns and cities, while the dead join their ranks. By the time the army is on approach to Andarun, it's a veritable horde. Even worse, a sizable percentage of town and city defenders are convinced to defect via the use of clever marketing and advertising by the undead. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.jzacharypike.com/assets/img/undeadArmy.jpg">See here for the artwork<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Detarr's defeat, all the remaining undead now follow Detarr's second-in-command - Knight-Commander Tyren Ur'Thos.

It's not clear if the marriage has ever been consummated, but neither spouse particularly likes the other. Handor deals with the loveless marriage by throwing himself into running the kingdom and, occasionally, into a chambermaid's bed.

Then he invites a Gnoll widow and her three cubs to live with him (he remembers her late husband from Goldson Baggs), and she becomes his invaluable assistant, while the Wood Gnomes also prove extremely useful. Eventually, he starts making plenty of money and buys up a number of apartment buildings, where the Gnoll widow settles those displaced by the recent events, who would otherwise have nowhere to turn to. Why is he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> then?

While she does come back, she makes it clear that the "couple" part of this is over. Despite this, their magic complements one another: Laruna's raw power and Jynn's skill with spell-weaving. For example, during a battle, Laruna channels her fire at an enemy holding a shield.

Al'Matra is the mother goddess, who has gone mad after her lover betrayed her and started a war, which was only ended when Al'Matra's son killed her lover. The author periodically updates his blog to list various gods. There's usually one god in each category per the original races of Man, although all Stennish gods were banished after the War of Betrayal, and many of their names have been forgotten.

A mage then explains that giltin are merely a symbol of power: the more giltin a person has, the more power he or she possesses. Gorm admits he has never thought about it this way before.

It started, when Al'Thadan (the All Father), the king of the gods, betrayed his lover Al'Matra (the All Mother), revealing himself and the Sten (humanoid giants with great raw magical power) to be agents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Mannon</a>. They unleashed Trolls on the races of Man, who slaughtered them left and right, until Tandos, one of Al'Matra and Al'Thadan's sons, rallied mankind against the forces of Mannon. The war ended, when Tandos's armies wiped out the Sten and he personally killed Al'Thadan. The war had far-reaching consequences for the world of Arth, with Mannon and some of the other gods on his side creating the Shadowkin and the monster races to fight the Children of the Light. It also reshaped the world's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon">Fantasy Pantheon</a>, with the traitor gods being cast aside, and Tandos becoming the regent, as Al'Matra has gone mad after Al'Thadan's betrayal and is in no condition to rule.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a>: Mordo Ogg is the god of death.

That said, when Detarr Ur'Mayan starts raising an undead army, the priests of Mordo Ogg get extremely annoyed, since souls are supposed to go from the mortal realm to the dominion of their god, not the other way around. The priest in Andarun ends up going out onto the streets during the attack on the city and uses the power granted by Mordo Ogg to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnUndead">destroy the undead in the vicinity</a> in order to restore the natural balance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>: Trolls have incredible self-healing abilities.

Applying a salve to a wound heals it in a matter of seconds. The healing potions are treated as particularly necessary for professional heroics, and also as dangerous as a legally-controlled narcotic in the real world: the rush of healing, the "good feeling" that comes with drinking a potion, is potentially addictive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaitha's real addiction is healing potions, not booze.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>: After being soundly beaten by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gorm</span> and healed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thane</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brunt</span> decides he no longer wants to be a bad guy.

Mages (called noctomancers and solamancers, respectively) tend to be masters of either one or the other. There used to be a third group of mages called omnimancers, capable of weaving both warp and weft spells, but they tended not to have much control over it and were seen as an abomination by the other two orders.

Near the end of the second book, the party splits up, but not for long, as Gorm manages to get them back together.

While he undoubtedly holds a grudge for Gorm chopping off one of his arms, thus forcing him to replace it with an animated prosthetic, he isn't stupid enough to fight a berserker one-on-one.

Of note are the Halflings (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">Hobbits</a> above), the Scribkin (Clan Tinkrin), and the Tinderkin (Clan Kaedrin).<ul><li> The Scribkin are often seen as the quintessential Gnomes due to their appearance, work ethic, and curiosity, and they won't argue the point. They are hard workers (although they prefer intellectual labors to physical ones), and their natural curiosity drives them to advance the science of Arth. They are the only ones to use flying machines for transportation. After being driven from their home of Essenpi by the Kobolds during the War of Betrayal, they have managed to retake Essenpi, but much of the ancestral knowledge was lost, and they are only scratching at the surface of their forebears' advances.

They have Elf-like features and their nomadic culture is reminiscent of Gypsies (in fact, on Arth, it's <em>Gypsies</em> who are often called Tinderchildren). Being the physically strongest Gnomes, they often work as professional heroes and mercenaries. They are quick on their feet and prefer the outdoors.</li><li> The Wood Gnomes of Clan Fengeld (called Domovoy by Ruskans) are only a few inches tall. Most consider them pests, as they frequently move into a property. If they're disrespected (which includes not following certain rituals, such as knocking three times and spinning in place when entering), they show off their capacity for property destruction. On the other hand, they also can be a boon to anyone they respect, as they are quick and hard workers.</li><li> The Hill Gnomes of Clan Erdin (also known as Dwerrow) have many similarities with Dwarves, with the major difference being the existence of Dwerrow women. Don't call them "Hill Dwarves" though. Neither they nor Dwarves like that.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">Our Goblins Are Different</a>: Goblins are Shadowkin pests, who are ugly as sin and are only really dangerous in large packs. Adventurers typically slay them in droves. They only speak their language, not that anyone is interested in speaking with them. <em>Orconomics</em> starts with an adventurer clearing out a Goblin infestation in a farmer's basement (obliterating half the farm and sleeping with the farmer's daughter along the way). One Goblin manages to survive and flees. He happens upon the sleeping Gorm, who protects the Goblin from the adventurer and later helps him obtain his NPC papers and hires him on as his squire (all NPCs need to have a job for the papers to be valid).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurKoboldsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurKoboldsAreDifferent">Our Kobolds Are Different</a>: Dog-like kobolds exist as a sub-clan of gnolls.

The leader of the Orcs send to get them comes off as threatening, demands they hand over their weapons, boasts about the number and sharpness of his warriors' weapons while insulting theirs, separates them, and takes them to his chief. The chief then threatens to "honor" them with his axe, which is, quite obviously, taken as a threat. Luckily, it's eventually made clear that the Orcs were actually being <em>friendly</em> and mercantile, but their manner didn't come off as anything but hostile. The leader of the Orc group (the chief's son) has actually adopted the "Aggressive Salesman" posture, trying to entice the potential customers to buy the Orcs' wares (namely, weapons) by boasting about the goods, while insulting the competition (the party's weapons). As for forcibly marching them to see the chief, they were just providing an honor guard to the visitors. Being separated? Well, that's just personal service. As for how the Men were supposed to know the Orcs were friends, well, the chief's son did wear his beads in a way clearly indicative of friendship, it's just that most Men don't know much about Orc customs. The chief's offer to honor them with his axe was actually supposed to have been taken as an offer to <em>give</em> said weapon to Gorm as a gesture of goodwill. When the whole mess is cleared up, the party suddenly starts to see the Orcs in a new light and far less threatening. When Gorm later asks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thane</span> why he didn't intervene, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Troll</span> points out that the Orcs were <em>clearly</em> not hostile, so he didn't see a reason to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig">Professor Guinea Pig</a>: Gremlins are extremely good at biomancy, and they tend to use it, first and foremost, on themselves.

You look like a peasant." in those moments. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This proves to be his undoing during the second book's climax, as Jynn suddenly recalls all the times Detarr has said that to him over the years and angrily questions his father why appearances matter more to him than his son's well-being and happiness. This finally gives Jynn the resolve he needs to fully embrace his omnimancy nature and defeat the lich.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkullForAHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkullForAHead">Skull for a Head</a>: Some types of undead come back as bare skeletons or revenants.

When King Handor flies to a fortress on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">giant eagle</a>, he remarks on how easy and quick the trip is, with none of the hazards of overland travel. He asks why the Heroes' Guild doesn't use the eagles all the time, such as to shorten a long journey or to rescue trapped Heroes. The Guild Master replies that they'd love to... but the eagles have unionized, and the Guild simply can't afford their rates for extensive usage.</li><li> Dannel Clubs, a boisterous heavyset businessman with all the subtlety of a board with a nail driven through it, appears to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>.

Throwing something outside the bubble is dangerous, as some of the momentum is retained during the passage, resulting in that object traveling at a huge speed. The effect lasts only a few minutes and is used by the party to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">steal the Wyrmwood Staff of Geffyn from a museum</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Token Human</a>: The majority of the party are humans.

A person's form after death depends on his or her desires and/or sins. Ironically, those who led blameless and unambitious lives end up as the lowest of the low - skeletons. An undead person retains his or her mental faculties and is able to communicate just as well as before dying and rising up, so it can be fun to read about skeletons and zombies engaging in philosophical discussions about their new condition.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>: Laruna has incredible reserves of magic.

They're just a type of undead, which doesn't stop a teenage girl from wanting to be one, so she can sneak into boys' windows at night and seduce them. However, she ends up unknowingly looking into the eyes of a wight and gets incinerated as a result. She comes back as a shade instead of a vampire and laments not having a body with which to seduce boys.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>: The Southern (or Desert) Empire, originally called the Empire of Man.
