The companions encountered kings, wizards, dryads, politics and treachery. Ultimately, Garion's true identity was revealed. And so Garion took up the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">sword of his destiny</a> to save the world...</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>That's the plot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>'s <em>The Belgariad</em>...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney">and a whole lot of</a> other stories as well.</p><p>David Eddings wrote the series after taking a course on literary criticism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperrific">digging out all the tropes he could find,</a> and deciding to build a world that was simultaneously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> and <em>really, really good</em> &mdash; because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.

Much later, the series was followed by two standalone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequels</a>, <em>Belgarath the Sorcerer</em> and <em>Polgara the Sorceress</em>, which tell the life stories of the title characters.

When he fails to predict a squall and his employers complains, he <em>literally</em> suggests that a wizard might've conjured the storm. His boss thinks it's a lame excuse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's implied that actually something much more powerful than a wizard that's conjured the storm.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>: Ctuchik claims he and Belgarath have gone beyond restrictions of morality when the latter mildly objects to his love for torture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheGods">Above the Gods</a>: UL and the two opposing Destinies are much more powerful than the gods. The Destinies are equal in power, but how they stack up to UL is unknown.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">Achievements in Ignorance</a><ul><li> Garion succeeds in bringing a horse back to life, simply because he doesn't <em>know</em> that it's supposed to be impossible.<ul><li> Deconstructed later in the same novel when Belgarath explains, in detail, why it was so dangerous and stupid to attempt. He then proceeds to lecture Garion a bit on the rules of using the series' magic, including the requirement that the person has to <em>fully</em> understand the mechanics of what he or she is doing.</li><li> The deconstruction gets reconstructed itself later on, when it is discussed how one of Garion's skills is "being able to visualize highly complicated concepts reduced to very simple terms" &mdash; which means he is actually able to "gloss over" most of the finer points of the more complicated things when working his magic and <em>still</em> get the desired effect.</li></ul></li><li> Neat subversion with Queen Islena, when she makes her High Priest choose between joining the army or getting thrown into the dungeon. The king could never have made that threat to a priest because there's specific laws about evidence and proper treatment regarding priests, which would be politically scandalous for the king to ignore. Islena got away with it because everyone thought her too stupid to know better. The subversion is that the whole thing was planned by her smarter advisors, taking advantage of both her ignorant reputation and her actual ignorance. Had anyone else tried that, it would have been only an ineffective bluff. But coming from Islena, the threat was believable, since she really <em>was</em> unaware that she wasn't allowed to do what she threatened when she made the threat; she really would have had the priest chained to the wall in the deepest dungeon she could find before anyone got around to telling her it was illegal.</li><li> Lampshaded by Polgara in <em>Polgara the Sorceress</em> as she muses over the idea that simply being ignorant of a task's impossibility might, however improbably, let someone perform impossible feats.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>: The Purpose Of The Universe gets cranky if you ask it "why me". Near the end, Garion asks "why me?" in the most annoying, immature, whiny tone he can muster. The Purpose cracks up.<ul><li> There's another one in <em>the Malloreon</em>, when the heroes end up roped into doing a job for the Dagashi, and ask for money to cover expenses. The Dagashi leader shows them a chest full of gold and invites them to take some, but no more than two hands can hold. Sadi sends up Toth, who has hands the size of saucepans, who scoops out about a quarter of the gold in the chest. Sadi then asks if he should put some back, since he (for many reasons) has no desire to piss off the Dagashi more than necessary, but their leader laughs and waves it off, stating the errand would make them <em>earn</em> the money and the demonstration of cleverness pleases him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">A-Cup Angst</a>: Ce'Nedra complains of her small bust, and when she commissions armor for herself, has the chest "enhanced". The narration notes that her figure fills out quite a bit after her first pregnancy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex">Adipose Rex</a>: Subverted and later deconstructed by King Rhodar of Drasnia. He is extremely obese, yes, but subverts the trope by being the best-read king in the West, and the best strategist, along with being a compassionate and competent ruler, with a little help from his loving and similarly-clever wife. Deconstruction rears its ugly head when his girth ultimately shortens his life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: <em>The Malloreon</em> is basically fuelled by this- having your infant son abducted by your arch-enemy, and being faced with the very real prospect of having to fight him to save the world</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvantageBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvantageBall">Advantage Ball</a>: How Garion's fight with Torak ends up: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Garion manages to secure victory by the mere fact of his own continued defiance</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>: The sorcerers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a>: Beldin has a stick with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">only one end</a>.

If they directly clashed, they would blot out entire tracts of existence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: <em>The Rivan Codex</em> serves as additional content composed of background information, inspiration, and lore for the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>: Garion and Ce'Nedra are betrothed by a five-hundred-year-old treaty between their countries, not to mention that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">prophecy thing</a>. True to the trope, they engage in quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">Slap-Slap-Kiss</a>, but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played with</a> in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">neither knew about the arrangement</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05s88');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note05s88" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05s88');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ce'Nedra knew she had to be presented as the bride of the Rivan King on her sixteenth birthday, but not that said King would actually show up or that Garion was he.

Additionally, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">play a pivotal role in preventing the armies of the West from being massacred at Thull Mardu</span>.

The misconception arises because people confuse tournament armor worn for jousting matches&mdash;armor that was so heavy a knight had to be lifted by a winch onto his horse&mdash;with field plate worn in actual combat.

There's a brief scene when he's ashamed, and his wife, Merel, pointedly calls him out for it in veiled language (it goes straight over Garion's head), but that's all there is to it &mdash; Polgara is actually amused when she realises that Merel is pregnant (granted, she might not know the circumstances) and the resulting child, Unrak, is presented as making everything better between the two of them. Beyond that, it's never mentioned again, and quietly filed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>). At first, this might be startling, but considering that Barak's a Cherek, and it's repeatedly noted that even by the standards of the other medieval-ish Alorn kingdoms the Chereks &mdash; a Viking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> (or at least, counterparts of what most people imagine as Vikings) &mdash; hold the most sexist attitudes (though in Anheg's case, it's mostly an act for political purposes), with Silk's wry observation that they haven't yet quite worked out that women are human.<ul><li> Hettar's murderous attitude to Murgos following his parents being killed in a Murgo raid when he was a child, which is mostly presented in the first series as a personal quirk/product of his backstory/occasional inconvenience, save for when Garion wonders at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfHate">Power Of Hate</a> that could drive a seven year old boy to survive being left for dead and result in, well, Hettar. Considering that most of the Murgos encountered are soldiers or spies/assassins, the protagonists are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Alorns</a>, big on vengeance, and hating Murgos, it's not surprising that most of them don't really think it's worth mentioning. That said, in Belgarath's prequel, Polgara grimly remarks that she's afraid that a young Hettar could be growing into "a proper monster", so it's not completely overlooked.</li><li> The Nadrak custom of women technically being owned by men is regarded as this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, with most who aren't familiar with it being somewhere between bemused by and horrified at it. The reactions are at least partially ameliorated by the crucial part, which is that the woman retains the rights to their person, meaning that any man who is so unwise as to touch a Nadrak woman without her express consent, even if he is her nominal owner, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">is very quickly going to regret it</a>. Said skills mean that a woman can always 'persuade' an owner to sell her if she doesn't like him, regardless of her treatment. There's also the part where every time a Nadrak woman is sold, she gets to keep half the money. So not only are Nadrak women better at haggling and sales pitches, they tend to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">wider variety of skills</a> to up their sale prices. It's implied that among the 'elderly' Nadraks, the women are generally much, much wealthier than the men. And added to all that, as Polgara observes in her prequel, for the most part Nadrak women actually have more actual freedom and independence than most 'free' women elsewhere in the world.</li><li> In general, most of the examples filed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCentredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCentredMorality">Protagonist-Centred Morality</a> also qualify.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchDevils">Demon Lords And Arch Devils</a>: In <em>The Malloreon</em>, it's revealed that Demons/Devil-Spirits, have rank the same way that people do. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief">Nahaz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda">Mordja</a> are the two that Garion and co. encounter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenOfIniquity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenOfIniquity">Den of Iniquity</a>: Several of the rooms in Ctuchik's tower in <em>Magician's Gambit</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>: Mara (God of the Marags) reaches it when the Tolnedrans finally swarm into Maragor to get at the gold that the Marags themselves didn't value at all, apparently killing the entire race.

As Belgarion says, it's "closer to a horse or dog..." It tends to get very enthusiastic when it "lends a hand" to Garion's sorcery, leading to some rather spectacular effects, and sometimes gives him unsolicited advice. For example, when he offhandedly mentions to Zakath that it could write his name in the stars, it starts to twitch, as if excited at the prospect that Garion wants it to do something for him. Zakath gets a bit wild-eyed and Garion immediately has to explain to the Orb it was only an example. It's implied that part of the reason Garion &mdash; and, indeed his ultimate ancestor Riva Iron-Grip &mdash; was chosen to bear the Orb is his basic humility; he's not subject to the temptation to use the Orb for the sake of power.<ul><li> Another great example of this is when Zakath is virtually holding Garion &amp; his crew prisoner in Rak Hagga. Garion and Zakath get into a heated argument, in which Garion informs Zakath that he can leave anytime he wants. When Zakath asks just how he proposes to do that, Garion loses his temper, uses his BFS to focus his will on the door and shouts "BURST!". The Orb, a bit startled by all this and wanting to help sink Garion's point, blows the 2-foot thick stone wall to fine gravel in addition to blasting the door to splinters.

The Nyissans have strong resemblance to both the ancient Egyptian and ancient Central American cultures in dress, politics, and rulership.

The office isn't hereditary, the Rivans choose based on character and ability&mdash;so every Brand is an intelligent man of reliable character, sound judgment, and an unbreakable sense of duty. So dedicated are they to their duty that upon assuming office, they abandon whatever name they had before, becoming known simply as 'Brand' (which was the name of the first one to hold the office). They've spent a long time taking care of Riva and its throne while waiting for the return of the true king, but once he DOES show up, they never falter, and continue to serve faithfully.

Up to a point, Riva's descendants <em>were</em> actually told of their lineage; in one generation in particular, however, the Bear-Cult (duped and led by Asharak) caught hold of the heir, plied him with tales of glory, and subverted his mind, nearly ruining the Prophecy.

Issa may also qualify; in his case, he kinda forgot to make his wife Salmissra immortal, so generations of Nyissan priests have been picking someone who looks sorta like the original Salmissra, renaming her, and installing her as Queen ... apparently without Issa ever noticing.

Breaking things is fine, as that just changes its state, but using magic to make something "Be not!" causes it to backlash and take <em>you</em> out. Which means that you technically <em>can</em> unmake something, so long as the something is <em>you</em>. A couple of sorcerers in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> actually committed suicide this way.</li><li> Magic comes in several types in Eddings' world. Sorcery uses "the Will and the Word". Witchcraft utilizes nature spirits. Magic involves summoning a demon to do your bidding for as long as you can hold him in the shape you create for him (generally, not long enough.) Necromancy exists, which is the magic of speaking with the dead spirits and commanding them. There are Wizards, whose power is never specifically defined in either set of books. It is also hinted at that there are more types of magic than that, such as that Salmissra has a type of magic which appears to be specific to the Brides of Issa. Also, it's worth mentioning that Alchemy isn't a form of magic. It is considered a science. Senji just happens to be a sorcerer who also is an alchemist. Belgarath, Beldin, and several Grolims both know how to do sorcery and magic, and a Mallorean hedge-sorcerer is more famous for alchemy than sorcery. However, it's strongly implied in <em>The Malloreon</em> that all types of magic are variations of the same basic principles.</li><li> Also: Magic requires you to pay homage to physics, meaning the sorcerers study nature and physics and the like quite a bit to understand how the world works <em>before</em> they try to mess with it. Try to lift a boulder taking into account the forces which have to go somewhere, you get pushed into the earth. Conjure a lightning storm in the wrong place, and you might mess up the global weather patterns. If you turn yourself into an animal, you'd better remember to include the heart.</li><li> Aside from unmaking there are two main limitations on sorcery. The first is that it's exhausting &mdash; Beldin teleports a bunch of loose rocks from one location to another for use as tower building material and it's all he can do to walk the next day. The second is anyone else proficient in sorcery can sense the use of sorcery near them, and the bigger and more spectacular the use, the further it can be "heard". These limitations stop sorcerers just blasting their way through any obstacles with brute force every time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>: Garion, who becomes frighteningly proficient with both weaponry and sorcery.

These Dryad genes can then be passed on to the children of that male &mdash; and they are, resulting in Ce'Nedra, who, thanks to dilution, is half Dryad. Pure dryads don't have male children.

Every single protagonist does things that would horrify most people in real life &mdash; though most are mitigated or addressed in later instalments.<ul><li> Barak is all but stated in the first book, <em>Pawn of Prophecy</em>, to have raped his wife Merel while drunk, battering down her locked bedchamber door to get to her; their arranged marriage was against Merel's will (though that part he doesn't seem to have been aware of) &mdash; Garion is present, but the implication goes over his head. Merel gets pregnant as a result of the rape; the incident is laughed off by Polgara <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">(who might or might not have known of the circumstances, having been busy keeping an eye on Garion).</a> Leaving aside all else, it's presented in-universe as a "reward" for Barak, and the other characters had previously made Merel out to be the one in the wrong for <em>treating Barak badly</em> (except for Silk, who just thinks that their marriage is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a> on Barak's part, and Garion and Durnik, who only get one side of the story).</li><li> However, the act itself is never presented as <em>good</em> thing, and even without the implicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a>, the behaviour is perhaps unsurprising: Barak's from a Viking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> which is noted more than once in text to be rather behind the curve on gender relations even by the standards of a medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> world (and that in real-life, marital rape wasn't even considered a crime in many parts of the Western world until very recently), it's also unsurprising that the incident is never mentioned again, being quietly filed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>.</li><li> Hettar is stated to have murdered many people who simply have the bad fortune of being Murgos, all because his parents were killed by Murgo bandits when he was a child. Granted, the vast majority would have been soldiers, and a significant number of the rest were most probably spies, but... probably not all. And yet, no one in-universe has an issue with the murder of unrelated, innocent people who are simply the wrong nationality. This is mitigated somewhat in the sequel series as the Murgos get more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and Hettar mellows, and in Belgarath's prequel, when Polgara bluntly states that a young Hettar is on the verge of turning into "a proper monster."</li><li> Ditto Lelldorin, the Asturian archer, who states openly that he and his friends have killed Mimbrate travellers who were simply riding through Asturian territory. None of the other protagonists &mdash; save Garion, who he confesses this to, and who is more than a little horrified &mdash; have any issue with this (though he only tells Garion, and while most of the others would probably know or suspect it, Durnik at least probably didn't).</li><li> Silk goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> to avenge the murder of a Drasnian agent in the second series (<em>The Malloreon</em>). He slaughters many members of a rival Tolnedran family, the Honeths, simply because they are part of the family, whether they had anything to do with the murder or not. Again, none of the protagonists have any issue with Silk killing many innocent people, other than Silk "wasting time".</li></ul></li><li> Taken up to eleven in his prequel <em>Belgarath the Sorcerer</em>. A group of Nyissan assassins kill the Rivan king Gorek and his family at the behest of their queen Salmissra (and ultimately Zedar) in a botched attempt (one child survives) to make herself immortal by ending the line of the Godslayer who is fated to kill Torak &mdash; her thought being Torak would be so grateful he would marry her and make her immortal. Understandably Belgarath and the Alorns are <em>pissed</em> &mdash; however in addition to Belgarath confronting Salmissra directly (though he actually feels more sorry for her than anything else, considering how she was used, and tells her that one child survived to let her die happy that her manipulator's plan has failed), the Alorns invade Nyissa and basically slaughter 90% of the population (some 1.8 <em>million</em> people) and turn the country into a smoking wasteland as some kind of "object lesson" designed to terrify the Nyissans into not interfering in other countries ever again. Nearly 2 million mostly innocent (barring slave traders et al) people gruesomely slaughtered for something they knew nothing about and could not have prevented. <br><br>This event can arguably be laid at Zedar's door, because being a former Disciple of Aldur he knew exactly how the Alorns would react. It can also be considered a parallel of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> atrocity at B&eacute;ziers &mdash; both occur during a time period considered the "middle ages" in their respective worlds, both were considered acts of morality at the time and both are retrospectively considered a horrific aberration.</li><li> Subverted with the methodical slaughter of the Angarak army after Torak falls at Vo Mimbre, as revenge for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">what happened to Drasnia</a>, with the Tolnedran commander being sickened by the slaughter, calling it monstrous.

It is equally unfortunate, since her overdriven libido is a known side-effect of the drugs she takes to maintain her youthfulness and apparent similarity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">the original Salmissra</a>. The current Salmissra sees being polymorphed into a ten-foot snake as a vast improvement in her situation not simply because she's immortal and Nyissans like snakes, but because, for the first time in decades, she <em>isn't</em> desperately horny and can actually even think straight.</li><li> Bethra, though this is subverted to a certain extent given that she has apparently <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> been using sex to manipulate various major players in Tolnedra's political turmoil on the orders of Drasnian Intelligence</span>.</li><li> Belar &mdash; according to Belgarath, a common fantasy of Alorn women was to be visited in the night by their God and Belar liked to make as many dreams come true as possible. Initially, Belgarath admits that it might have been rumour, but his prequel all but states that it really did happen. A <em>lot</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really Seven Thousand Years Old</a><ul><li> Most of the sorcerers are several <em>thousand</em> years old. Except for Polgara, who looks to be in her mid-late twenties, they all look like old men. Polgara falls for Durnik, who's in his thirties &mdash; bit of an age gap. Belgarath is so old that he shows up as an aged <em>mentor</em> in the three-thousand-year-old "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Bible</a>" of the series, and is basically considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s followers. It doesn't help that when the sorcerers get caught up in research in their towers, they flat out seem to forget that time is flowing. Belgarath managed to not notice that the wolf which had been staring at him while he puttered around his tower had been doing so for a thousand years until one day he stopped and actually did the math to realize it. Belgarath himself doesn't even seem to notice how old he is until he's <em>over three hundred years old</em>, when he finally asks his god why he doesn't seem to be ageing. The god replies that he's always found it <em>inconvenient</em>.</li><li> Theories as to how this works are more or less confirmed in the prequel books, when Belgarath speculates that it's tied to the will to live. He also theorizes regarding ageing something to the effect of, "Old and distinguished on a man is perfectly natural and accepted. Old and distinguished on a woman equals crone," and there's no way Polgara would have put up with something like that.</li><li> Inverted in the case of Salmissra, Queen of Nyissa and consort of the slumbering snake god Issa. She takes a potion to maintain her outer youth but she's really a mortal woman like all of her predecessors, chosen for their resemblance to the original Salmissra, who died ages ago. Polgara <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">"remedies"</a> the situation by turning her into an immortal giant serpent. More deconstructed than averted, because part of Polgara's rationalization for what she does to Salmissra is that Issa forgot to make the original Salmissra immortal in the first place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">Rebellious Princess</a>: Ce'Nedra</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclaimedByNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclaimedByNature">Reclaimed by Nature</a>: Polgara revisits the site of the former city of Vo Wacune and laments that the trees have overrun the site "so soon"- the trees in question being full-grown redwoods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hand</a>: Torak's not called the Maimed God for nothing.

However, Belgarath speaks one very clearly&mdash;because no magician in his right mind would try summoning a Demon <em>Lord</em> (basically one step short of summoning the King of Hell himself). Belgarath does this because he needs to deal with a lot of demons very quickly, and thus summons one that can pull rank.</li><li> At one point in <em>Demon Lord of Karanda</em>, it's necessary for the heroes to use the Orb of Aldur to deal with a demon. Now, the Orb tends to be rather conspicuous when used (generating "noise" that sorcerers can hear and emitting a brilliant blue glow), which would reveal their location to people looking for them. So, instead of trying to convince the Orb to tone it down, they go the other direction, lighting up the sky for hundreds of miles around and generating so much sorcerous noise that the entire province of Karanda shakes from it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeError">Relative Error</a>: In <em>Castle of Wizardry,</em> Garion meets his cousin Adara &mdash; who, it has to be said, is stunningly beautiful and who he instantly hits it off with.

This is also the moment when she is forced to admit that she loves Garion.<ul><li> Given some of the other marriages in the series, the fact that she's his cousin doesn't necessarily mean that they <em>couldn't</em> be an item, though in this case they happen not to be.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a>: The Grolims lead one worshiping Torak, which it seems is centered entirely around human sacrifices to him, along with conquering everyone else in his name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember The New Bad Guy</a>: Urvon, the third Disciple of Torak, is introduced suspiciously early and spoken of often in <em>The Malloreon</em>, despite never meriting so much as a mention in <em>The Belgariad</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a>: The Asturian Arends' long standing rebellion against the Mimbrate Arends.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a>: Queen Salmissra is supposed to be immortal, but her god and lover Issa forgot to make her so.

(The rest are killed.) The rest of the world tends to regard them as interchangeable. Now that the current Salmissra really is immortal thanks to Polgara, the practice has probably stopped.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">Reptiles Are Abhorrent</a>: Played straight in the first series, but not in the second.

The main character learns this the hard way the first time he tries to move a giant stone, as he ends up buried up to his armpits in the ground (he tried to push it up instead of merely sideways). The protagonist's mentor scolds him and comments that if he HAD tried to push it sideways, he'd likely have been thrown across the continent by now.<ul><li> This is also used as an explanation for why certain magical effects are not used very often.

It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> with the implication that Asharak was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">tampering with his mind</a>, but that still doesn't explain why Belgarath didn't react to the name.</li><li> The author eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> this by categorizing the original books as the stories told about the events depicted where thing were changed by the storyteller for dramatic reasons and the prequels as personal memoirs subject to the personal biases and the distortions and omissions that human memory is by definition subject to, hence the same events being reported differently in different books.</li><li> Even more egregious example that no one seems to remember: there's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it passage in <em>Pawn of Prophecy</em> where a sleepy Garion overhears Polgara talking to...someone...and saying that she was not prepared for the task that they've set her, because what did she know about raising little boys? This makes it sounds like she only had to start caring for the last heir of Riva recently. I'm not sure when exactly it first changed to "Polgara has been caring for the children of the line of Riva for centuries..."<ul><li> Not really as egregious as one might think: recall, Geran and Ildera, Garion's parents, were murdered by Asharak when Garion was just an infant, forcing Polgara to take a far more direct hand in raising him than she normally would.</li></ul></li><li> Polgara's character was retconned to be much more reasonable in the prequels. In <em>Queen of Sorcery</em> especialy, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a> to the point of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">psychologically abusive</a>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">horribly murdering a man with magical fire</span>, the last thing a traumatised 15-year-old boy needs is his mother figure suddenly insisting on calling him a different name with no further explanation, and then start invading his thoughts and tampering with his mind by giving him smug advice telepathically and making him write his "new name" instead of his real one when he's learning to write.<ul><li> On the other hand, a lot of her behaviour can be explained by several important facts: Garion is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> and less than a year away from going up against the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a>. He therefore needs to get used to the idea of both his vast powers and his name (both are tied together), because his powers are finding their way out in lots of little ways that he can't control and are making a lot of 'noise', drawing exactly the wrong sort of attention. Moreover, Polgara is especially protective of Garion out of guilt, because Asharak/Chamdar successfully lured her away from Geran and Ildera when he was born, and then grabbed Garion - and would have got away clean if it wasn't for the arrival of a homicidal Belgarath. In other words, she's terrified about what might happen if she takes her eye off him again (and considering the amount of trouble he gets into, this isn't entirely unreasonable).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichLanguagePoorLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichLanguagePoorLanguage">Rich Language, Poor Language</a>: Poorer Arends have the "Wacite brogue"&#151;basically a Scottish or Irish accent.

When a Emperor's attempt to force Riva to trade ends in disaster, he calls for an invasion &mdash; and discovers that while Aloria isn't <em>officially</em> a single nation anymore, but it <em>is</em> an unofficial confederation. When the Rivan King is assassinated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">it's made clear that, yes, Aloria does exist.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySuitableSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySuitableSuitor">Suddenly Suitable Suitor</a>: Garion and Ce'Nedra, deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in that neither knows they're going to be in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>... and they've been thrown together all along with the intent that they fall in love. Even funnier is that Ce'Nedra had been starting to have feelings for Garion (despite knowing it would be completely impossible politically for her to marry so far beneath her station), until she discovers that he's the hereditary Overlord of the West and as such is not only an eminently suitable suitor but actually outranks her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">At this point, she becomes furious because now an ancient treaty means she ''has'' to marry him.</a> To be fair, Garion isn't entirely happy about it either, though he's mostly just bewildered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>: Two of the three main branches of supernatural powers (sorcery, witchcraft and magic) revolve around this.

The sound can be lessened by doing things slowly, and shapeshifting, because it's directed internally, is very quiet.

Interestingly, other forms of supernatural power, such as magic, wizardry, necromancy, and prophecy, do not make this signature noise.<ul><li> In an interesting variation, the reason that the Grolims were kept away from Kell with a curse was to keep them from noticing that the Dals were not using magic in general, but specifically employing telepathy to form a sort of "group mind" (and thereby listening in and receiving advance notice of the prophecies they could not be allowed to have). So while magic was being used, it was employed in a more literal sense than usual since it was creating an actual sound (mental, but still something that could be "heard") others could be sensitive to.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight">Sword Fight</a>: Several, with Garion vs Torak, and Cho-Hag vs Taur Urgas being two of the best.

They know their war is ultimately hopeless: they're vastly outnumbered, and even if Garion wins, they don't expect to survive.

Belgarath vs. Zedar in the fifth book is an aversion; Belgarath is too angry and Zedar too frightened to be able to summon up any magic, so they settle their score through a combination of shouting and fisticuffs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">Wizards Live Longer</a>: Since all the sorcerers we meet in the books are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDrivenInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDrivenInvulnerability">essential to the plot</a>, it's never conclusively established if it's the power of sorcery itself that grants a long lifespan or whether it was given to these sorcerers by one of the Prophecies as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> so they can accomplish the tasks set out for them. At the end of <em>Pawn of Prophecy</em>, Belgarath explains to Garion that everyone lives as long as they need to, and that his task just happens to be something that has taken a very long time. <br>In any case, sorcerers get effective immortality as a package deal with their powers, and witches like Vordai have a few more centuries than the average person in them. Magicians' lifespans are never specified, though it's likely few reach their natural span <em>anyway</em>, considering how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy">dangerous</a> what they do is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">Who Wants to Live Forever?</a>:<ul><li> Mostly averted &mdash; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">local rules of magic</a> mean that learning sorcery instantly conveys immortality. Sorcerers never bitch about it, and instead find ways to stay busy for all of those years. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explored further</a> in <em>The Malloreon</em> and the supplemental novels. Sorcerers do spontaneously pop up from time to time, but there's some attrition due to accidentally (or deliberately) unmaking themselves. The ones that survive this process are the ones who learn how to handle immortality. Belgarath even admits that part of the sorcerer aloofness and tendency to hole up in their towers in study and ignore the passing of a few centuries, every now and then, is a vital coping technique, lest grief drive them insane. It also makes Polgara that much more incredible, as she was forced to forgo this tactic for a thousand years... living with a family line whose every member (<em>every</em> member, <em>from birth to death</em>) she was intimately involved with.</li><li> It would be interesting to see how Garion copes in ten to twenty years time when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> start dying off... <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9sys0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9sys0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9sys0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Silk, the oldest non-immortal member of the group, is pushing fifty by the end of <em>The Malloreon</em>.</span> although his wife is capable of living much longer than regular mortals, and several of his family members are ageless, so he won't be all alone.</li><li> Played very straight with Belgarath. Two of his sorcerer brothers &mdash; whom he has lived with in the Vale for hundreds of years &mdash; take their own lives due to depression. After losing his wife of 500 years (who had been a companion for over a thousand before that), he goes insane and has to be chained to his bed and constantly supervised to make sure he doesn't take his own life. After a year he starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> and becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">a drunken beggar</a> for two years (Beldin explicitly states that he was "a legend" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Camaar</a>, because they've never seen <em>anybody</em> get <em>that drunk</em> before) and eventually ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace">entertaining women in Maragor</a> until Beldin finally intervenes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did it Have to be Caves?</a>: Silk's dislike of enclosed spaces is tipped over into a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Claustrophobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Claustrophobia">phobia</a> after a traumatic event in the first series. He also doesn't like snakes. This becomes a major plot point when his love interest in the second series starts to carry a highly venomous snake in her bodice. Some have speculated that she did this strictly to mess with Silk; however this is neither stated nor even strongly implied in the books. She has, however, commented on more than one occasion that Zith was cold and it was a place for her to be warm. Liselle is a pragmatist as well, and it is suggested that (possibly at the unknown prompting of the Prophecy of Light) she began doing so because it might be useful in the future. And it was. This theory is supported by her telling Silk that the first time she did it it made her skin crawl and it was all she could do to keep from screaming.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a>: Invoked by Belgarath in <em>The Malloreon</em>, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the fact that there really <em>are</em> only two sides in the great conflict: Change or an Eternal Status Quo.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombHorror">Womb Horror</a>: One of <em>The Malloreon's</em> darker moments has the protagonists find a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">demonic cult</a> waiting for a grotesquely, impossibly pregnant woman to deliver.

Lord, does he make a mess of things, and Belgarath is NOT happy with him triggering blizzards, tornados, droughts, another Ice Age, that sort of thing. Garion is ordered to study weather for 2000 years before touching it again. Then Belgarath has a <em>major</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment when Garion promises to "make time" to do it (all Garion meant was that he'd rearrange his schedule).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious">You Called Me "X"; It Must Be Serious</a>: Durnik, who has been quietly in love with Polgara for years, <em>always</em> calls her by the respectful "Mistress Pol", because that's how he's known her since they first met on Faldor's farm. It's not until <em>Enchanters' End Game</em>, when she utterly magically exhausts herself and collapses, that we hear him cry out a terrified "Polgara!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a>. The majority of the conflict in the books comes from the truly ridiculous amount of effort spent by the Child of Dark in attempting to suborn the Prophecies. This <em>always</em> turns out to be its ultimate downfall.</li><li> In <em>The Malloreon</em>, the Big Guy Band from the first series spends some time trying to subvert the Prophecy's instructions that they stay out of things, only to have it gleefully send them in circles until they "coincidentally" meet up with the heroes post-climax.</li><li> Really, you <em>can</em> fight Fate... Fate just has many more resources at its disposal, all the time in the universe to prepare, the reaction time to deal with things personally, a roving squad of sorcerers enforcing its plans, and a twisted sense of humor to boot.

However, books are telling the backstory of <em>The Belgariad</em>. Present-day characters are <em>deliberately</em> named after historical figures, yet Belgarath treats the names of the historical figures as "coincidence". One teeth-grindingly bad instance occurs in Belgarath's tale, at the Battle of Vo Mimbre. We're introduced to the original Korodullin and Mayaserena, who are wedded to keep the country of Arendia together. In the present day of <em>The Belgariad</em>, we're told that all Arend monarchs are deliberately named after those two, to keep Arendia unified, yet Belgarath calls it a "coincidence" that the original pair had those names.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">You Killed My Father</a>: When Garion finds out that the Grolim Asharak murdered his parents by burning them alive, he swears vengeance, and delivers it in the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">karmic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">way</a> possible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXMas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXMas">You Mean X Mas</a>: Erastide, the world's birthday.

Banned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s countries, probably because it involves honoring <em>all</em> the gods, not just Torak. Torak doesn't like to share. Honoring all the gods might just be a particular variant of the feast celebrated in Sendaria, which is the only kingdom without a state religion. Interestingly enough, they really honor <em>all</em> the gods, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Polgara chokes a bit when a Sendarian priest asks Torak to bless the union of Garion's parents, who will after all give birth to the man destined to kill him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeverDidThatForMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeverDidThatForMe">You Never Did That for Me</a>:<ul><li> Played with early in <em>The Belgariad</em>, before Garion gets his big reveal. Garion and Ce'Nedra are talking about the girl Garion probably would have married had things gone another way, and Garion says it's for the best because she's not someone you can ask to sleep on the ground. Ce'Nedra points out that the group had never hesitated to ask <em>her</em> to sleep on the ground. Garion manages to give what may be the only good answer possible at that point: "I guess you're stronger."</li><li> Played again later with the same characters, after they've been married a while. Talking about how some acquaintances recently got betrothed and married, Ce'Nedra complains about how Garion never asked for <em>her</em> hand in marriage, leading to him getting on his knee to make a proper belated proposal. (Ce'Nedra replies that she will think about it.)</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
