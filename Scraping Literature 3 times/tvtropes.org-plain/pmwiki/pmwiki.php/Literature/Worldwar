They expect a fairly easy conquest given the locals' lack of sophistication. Their probe mission, just eight hundred local years ago&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly">certainly nowhere near enough time to advance technologically at all</a>&mdash;found sword-swinging savages riding on animals. Then, to their discomfort, they discover that the planet is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable">emitting radio transmissions</a>. Arriving late in the local year 1941, they find the primitive industrial civilization of the Tosevites confusing, implausible, and an affront to the Race's rigid doctrines. Worse, if the Tosevites have advanced that much, it throws the certainty of the conquest in doubt. However, Fleetlord Atvar decides he could go down in history as one of three leaders to conquer an alien world, or the first to turn tail and flee without even having tasted combat. They go ahead with the conquest exactly as planned.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is a mistake.</p><p>They land squarely in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, to the absolute confusion of everyone involved. Through the eyes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, of all nationalities, human and alien, we read about the humans desperately trying to survive, and the aliens desperately trying to win. The Race is forced to become more like humans, making hasty decisions and breaking protocol. It also turns out that ginger (the spice) is a powerful and highly addictive narcotic for the Race, which further strains their normal way of life. This takes up the four books of the <em>Balance</em> series (the original <em>Worldwar</em> series) and ends with a stalemate and truce between the Race and the human governments that managed to resist their invasion (the USA, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">the Greater German</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Reich</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">Soviet Union</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>.)</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Next comes <em>Colonization</em>, a trilogy that picks up twenty years after the end of <em>Worldwar</em>. The Race's colonization fleet arrives on Earth expecting a subdued planet, only to find that barely more than half the planet's surface is under the control of the Race. This creates intense friction between the troops of the invasion fleet, who have been significantly changed by their interaction with humans, and the much more conservative and strait-laced colonists. Even more tension comes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">just-short-of-shots-fired</a> relationships between the surviving human powers: They are united in opposition towards the Race, threatening nuclear war in defense of an almost-enemy if the Race makes any aggressive moves, but all of the major human states are hostile towards each other, and are often trying to manipulate or cast blame on each other. Making matters worse for the Race, it is discovered that on top of its narcotic effects to the Race, ginger causes females to go into estrus out of season, something undiscovered by the all-male conquest fleet. This has devastating effects on the Race's mating cycles, and introduces them to some totally alien concepts like sex for pleasure, prostitution, and monogamy.</p><p>Finally, a standalone book, <em>Homeward Bound</em>, was added to the series. A whole bunch of humans get on a human-made starship and head towards the Race's homeworld, in an effort to negotiate a lasting peace between humans and the Race. The Race, for its part, is still contemplating the possibility of utterly destroying Earth to end the threat to the Empire, even though it would mean killing hundreds of millions of their own colonists. But in the end, they discover that it's already far too late to contain the humans, and they need to begin adapting to compete, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> especially since <em>more</em> Humans show up at Home in a <em>second</em> starship, this one having artificial gravity and a Faster-Than-Light stardrive</span>.</p><p></p><h2>Books include:</h2><ul><li> The original <em>Worldwar</em> series:<ul><li> <em>In the Balance</em></li><li> <em>Tilting the Balance</em></li><li> <em>Upsetting the Balance</em></li><li> <em>Striking the Balance</em></li></ul><p></p></li><li> The follow-up <em>Colonization</em> series:<ul><li> <em>Second Contact</em></li><li> <em>Down to the Earth</em></li><li> <em>Aftershocks</em></li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em>Homeward Bound</em> serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of the entire series.</li></ul><hr><h2>These books provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder">Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder</a>: Jens Larssen and Barbara Larssen are separated when Jens goes on an important mission to contact the US military, and both begin to feel physical attraction to others during the separation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Barbara ultimately believes that Jens has died on his mission and begins a relationship with Sam Yeager, while Jens believes that Barbara is still waiting for him and so avoids having an affair.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">A.K.A.-47</a>: A lot of the Race's hardware sounds like it came out of Russian armories after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Skorzeny spends so much time being incredibly likeable and fun to be around that most people have to continually remind themselves that he is an unrepentant Nazi. After he has gotten one of the primary characters imprisoned by the SS, many other officers - unaware that he was behind the arrest - actually use his example as motivation to break their superior out of custody.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a>: The Axis and Allied alliances put aside their differences in order to focus on their common enemy. However, characters from all sides repeatedly say that they wish they had not been interrupted, and hope to resume their own conflicts once the present situation is resolved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienArtsAreAppreciated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienArtsAreAppreciated">Alien Arts Are Appreciated</a>:<ul><li> Some members of the Race have taken to baseball, and it is noted that the Race like Leni Riefenstahl's film-making techniques.</li><li> After his defection, Straha (who has been considered by other members of the Race to be more like Humans than one of the Race) notes that he <em>doesn't</em> care for a lot of human art and music. He is somewhat fond of Bach, however.</li><li> By the time of <em>Colonization</em>, what would have been the Baby Boomer generation (including Sam Yeager's teenage son) have grown up with the presence of the Race and are fairly enamored with their culture, including shaved heads, bodypaint, wearing little (or no) clothing in public, and terminology such as "I greet you" and using "hot" as a synonym for "good" (much like how "cool" is used in our world).</li><li> <em>Homeward Bound</em> reveals some of the Race on Home have taken to wearing clothes and wigs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienCatnip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienCatnip">Alien Catnip</a>: Ginger has a powerful and addictive narcotic effect on the Race, and once the colony ships arrive it even turns out to send their females into heat.

In <em>Homeward Bound</em>, this happens again when some mice the humans had brought to Home as food-testers are (accidentally) released and promptly multiply and go invasive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">The Race promptly throws a fit.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensMadeThemDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensMadeThemDoIt">Aliens Made Them Do It</a>: The Race abducts humans to test their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> and see that everyone can mate with everyone all year round. This is decidedly NOT played for comedy, and The Race is forced to face consequences later on from one woman who didn't appreciate being experimented on. Inverted in <em>Colonization</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienCatnip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienCatnip">ginger</a> puts Race females into heat out of season, causing chaos among The Race who forget everything when "mating season" starts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">All Psychology Is Freudian</a>: The series is set at a time when Freud's theories are respected and accepted, and because of its focus on sex human psychologists are stumped when trying to analyse the Race. They have no sexual thoughts outside of the mating season, so Freud doesn't apply. On the Race's side, their psychologists find it equally difficult to comprehend humans, as they don't have sex for pleasure, pair bonding or even families in their culture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllohistoricalAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllohistoricalAllusion">Allohistorical Allusion</a>:<ul><li> Being interrogated by the Japanese, Race soldier Teerts wishes that a nuclear bomb would fall upon the city. The city is Nagasaki, the second city destroyed by an atomic bomb in real-life.</li><li> General Patton criticizes the Race for getting bogged down in street fighting at Chicago, saying that unlike the Germans the Race are slow to learn from their mistakes and the Germans would not have tried to take Stalingrad house by house if they had reached it. In reality, they did, and it was a complete disaster, Patton uses the same tactics that the USSR used to destroy the German Sixth Army, and the main difference is that the Race actually fought <em>smarter</em> (they had the sense to pull back the force in the city and managed to save a large part of it, while Hitler refused to allow a retreat resulting in the complete loss of the Sixth Army).</li><li> After being able to destroy several Race landcruisers (albeit with heavy losses) with the help of the newly developed Tiger tanks, one of Jager's men wonders if the next type of tank they'll develop will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTank">Tiger</a> mounting a long-barreled gun and sloped armor.

It was also the capital of Germany from 1 May to 23 May 1945 in our own timeline - Karl Donitz led the German government from there after Hitler's suicide.</li><li> In <em>Second Contact</em> one member of The Race says to another, after dealing with Nazi ambassadors, that the city of Nuremberg is a trial. The Nuremberg Trials were ones in which the real Nazis were tried after WWII was over.</li><li> When Johannes Drucker comments on the suicide of the president of the United States, he thinks such a thing would never occur in the German Reich, and Hitler would sooner take up a mauser himself and fight until death. In real life, Hitler committed suicide when the Allies began closing in on Berlin.</li><li> After President Earl Warren's suicide, several of the Race's experts on humans gather to discuss the reasons behind this act. They unofficially call this gathering the "Warren Commission". In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the Warren Commission was the unofficial name for the committee that investigated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s assassination, named so after the presiding Chief Justice Earl Warren.</li><li> As the result of being hit by the Dora cannon, a Race starship explodes. By chance, this ship holds the majority of the fleet's nuclear ordnance, The bombs do not go off, but they do spread radioactive contamination across a wide area in the Ukraine. When a joint Soviet-German mission captures some of the uranium, two of them are running close to an abandoned village. The German officer asks what the village is called; the Soviet partisan replies it is Chernobyl.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: Aliens invade during World War II.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryNaziVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryNaziVictory">Alternate History &#150; Nazi Victory</a>: When space lizards invade during World War II Nazi Germany successfully defends itself and becomes one of the three human nuclear powers, and retains all wartime conquests except the western USSR (which is returned) and Poland (which is surrendered to the aliens). In 1965 the Greater German Reich fights and loses a short nuclear war against the aliens but, while forced to give up France and its nuclear and spacefaring technology, manages to retain the rest of its empire. By 2031, the Reich has recovered and is once again considered a world power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: Viewpoint characters die throughout the series.

By <em>Colonization</em>, human teenagers who grew up with the Race being a fact of life, learn stock phrases in their language such as "I greet you" and "It shall be done" and treat them as slang. Additionally, American teens adopt the word "hot" to have the same connotation as modern-day "cool".

The show is somewhat similar to Fox's <em>The Chamber</em>, where contestants answer questions while strapped into a human gyroscope and harassed with airjets, water sprays and mild electric shocks.

Heinrich had heard the rumors before then, but he hadn't believed in them. The third book sums it up nicely:<div class="indent">What Skorzeny didn't get and wouldn't get if he lived to be a hundred - not likely, considering how the SS man lived - was that <em>what we were supposed to do</em> and <em>what our superiors ordered us to do</em> weren't necessarily the same thing. <br>Soldiers didn't commonly have to make that distinction. J&auml;ger hadn't worried about it, not until he had found out how the Germans dealt with Jews in the east. Since then, he hadn't been able to look away. He knew what sort of disaster awaited the world if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Lizards</a> won the war. Like Skorzeny, he was willing to do just about anything to keep that from happening.

When Mutt asks if she is one of those "lizzies", she merely asks what his reaction would be if she was. It is never expounded upon, and she soon begins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">to return Mutt's attraction</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">Higher-Tech Species</a>: The Race have a higher technological base than any of the other three intelligent species known to exist, with an older culture and government as well.

The Race initially speculated that this was due to Earth having lots of oceans to mess with the pace of progress, while the Race had to plod along on land. Later on, human mating patterns are also blamed; humans are in constant competition, whereas the race mates only once a year (six months to us), thus leading to greater competition and faster advancement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreDivided">Humans Are Divided</a>: It's WWII, so naturally.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a>: Kind of. The other two races the Race has conquered were reptilian and similar in nature to themselves, while humans are mammalian. Logically, the Race deduced that <em>all</em> intelligent life is like them.

Most of his "insights" are common sense and real-world techniques of communicating between people who don't speak the same language (Generally pantomime, slow repetition and emotive expressions/sounds). It may simply be that Sam is actually willing to ''try' communicating with the Race, whereas just about everybody else (especially in the military) would just as soon kill them and call it a day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a>: The Race keep saying that their language is very logical compared to human ones, but from the few words we see they seem to have a similar number of irregular plural forms to your average human language. The Race themselves are often described as being obedient and subservient by nature, but once the Colonization Fleet arrives it turns out they casually break laws just as often as humans, including several characters who begin tasting ginger despite the already-present (and extremely harsh) regulations against it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>:<ul><li> Molotov, when he meets with Hitler, is repeatedly astounded by how much of the man's thinking revolves around the "fact" that the Jews are trying to cause trouble for humanity.

On the way home, he is approached by the base commander, who, informed of his leave, calls him a liar and a malingerer and tries to escort him back to Groves to clear things up.

The last book in the <em>Balance</em> series, the first of the <em>Colonisation</em> series and <em>Homeward Bound</em> opens with them doing this again, somewhat more ruefully.

The Race eventually learns the meaning behind these names and is none too pleased.</li><li> The Race's spaceship built to defend Home against the <em>Admiral Peary</em> is not named for an Emperor, like all the others.

What they do get is a screaming fit from Curtis LeMay who, though a three-star general, has no authority over them due to the chain of command. The one person who gives them orders <em>is not authorized to give them orders.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness</a>: For a story about an alien invasion it is a surprising Level 5 hardness (At least, until the <em>Colonization</em> series and <em>Homeward Bound</em>). With the exception of cold sleep, all technology is either equal to or inferior to real life technology. At no point do they bend, break or even <em>bounce</em> the laws of physics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovCocktail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovCocktail">Molotov Cocktail</a>: Molotov is one of the main characters, but he never actually touches one.

Mordechai himself admits that David is an honorable and brave man, and that just because they have opposing viewpoints does not make him a greedy and self-serving fool. However, once David is sent to a Soviet <em>gulag</em> he becomes a collaborator solely to support himself, and betrays friends and enemies alike to the head of the camp in order to advance his own agenda. This would normally count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">a change in the character because of his surroundings</a>, but his own thoughts and memories now reflect on how he did the same things back in Poland and throughout his life, and his very nature is self-serving.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">Moving the Goalposts</a>: Averted by Mordechai Anielewicz. When his son Heinrich asks for a beffel (a lizard pet), Mordechai's wife Bertha does what a typical parent would do and set a difficult condition for the kid. Of course, Heinrich manages to fulfil the condition and catches a beffel. Just as Bertha is about to invoke the trope (like any parent), Mordechai countermands her and and lets Heinrich keep him, earning Bertha's ire. A few days later, the beffel saves their lives by waking up Heinrich during a fire. After that, no one thinks that the little creature should go.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction">Mutually Assured Destruction</a>: After the first wave of invasion, this is the status quo between the human powers and the Race. Working together, the humans could eradicate the lands controlled by the Race, but only at the cost of getting obliterated themselves, and none of the major human powers like each other very much. Later, in "Homeward Bound," <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Race turns this around on humans: yes, the humans could use their FTL warships to obliterate the the Empire before any given world knew they were under attack. But the Race's slower-than-light ships are capable of being used as relativistic kill vehicles against Earth. The mass of a Race starship impacting the planet at 50% of the speed of light would not just obliterate human civilization, it would probably wipe out virtually all life and begin a new ice age.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a>: How some German and Russian characters, like Ludmila Gorbunova and Heinrich Jager feel.

However, what would be slightly chilly to humans is beastly cold to them, as their home world is so hot that snow is only occasionally found at the extreme poles of the planet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyEverComplainedBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyEverComplainedBefore">Nobody Ever Complained Before</a>: Members of the Race cannot understand why humans insist on fighting back so strenuously instead of just placidly accepting their rule. Their previous two conquest experiences had nothing like the long, drawn-out resistance that humanity offers even in supposedly-placid territories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">Nobody Poops</a>: Averted; differences in waste volume are a source of difficulty in the Race space plumbing when humans are aboard. Also, the Race are somewhat shocked that human plumbing is so good, and love hot showers. It is also revealed that the Race have probes that can detect uric acid &mdash; a component of urine &mdash; in the air, which they use to keep track of enemy populations and movements. The humans, however, discover this technology and deliberately pee on it, leading one technician to scream that <em>four billion</em> humans were approaching.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>: What happens when the Race tries to use anti-missile defences, intended for use against fragile and sophisticated guided missiles, against the big dumb <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">seven-ton</a></em> Dora rounds. To say the Lizards are flabbergasted is an understatement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal">Nothing Personal</a>: Spoken by Basil Roundbush in <em>Colonization</em> when David Goldfarb calls him out on using the fact that Goldfarb is a Jew and Britain's growing anti-Semitism in order to get Goldfarb to do his bidding. Roundbush keeps insisting that he personally doesn't care that Goldfarb is Jewish but finds it useful to lean on him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Nuke 'em</a>:<ul><li> Played with. The Race tries <em>not</em> to use nuclear weapons in order to keep Earth as clean as possible. They do destroy several human cities, including Berlin and Washington, D.C., but their strategy is intimidation and retaliation, since they do not want to go overboard and end up wrecking the entire planet. The exchange eventually degenerates into a boxing match of sorts once human powers develop nukes of their own; for each nuke that humanity detonates, the Race nukes a city in the corresponding "not-empire". Americans, for their part, nuke a number of their <em>own</em> cities that are in lizard claws. The lizards eventually realize that humans would rather waste the whole planet rather than submit to the Race and sue for peace.</li><li> Once the war between the Reich and the Race restarts in <em>Colonization</em>, both sides use nukes heavily. The Nazis nuke most major Polish cities and their spaceships (all armed with nukes) attempt to shoot down Race ships. When Hungary attempts to make peace with the Race, the Reich punishes them by nuking Budapest. By the time the Reich sues for peace, most of it is a radioactive wasteland from lizard bombs.

While humanity at large bands together and set aside its differences to fight the Race, it quickly becomes clear that the notion gets cast aside, no one all that eager to let any particular nation, group or ideology take charge over all mankind.

However, they fail to do anything about the Dora rail cannon rounds, as their shells are too thick. They also aren't 100% reliable against much more primitive human rockets, which the Germans and the Americans start using.

Additionally, Liu Mei's first word was a lizard emphatic cough.</li><li> A human baby is abducted by the Race, named Kassquit and raised by the scientist Ttomalss as one of them to see if the Tosevites can integrate into the Empire. He does not know <em>what</em> to do when she hits puberty, and the increasing problems of reconciling her human nature with her identity as a member of the Race causes her a lot of anguish.

Later, they find out that counter-missiles are ineffective against German supergun shells, and that radar is pretty useless when it come to detecting a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po-2">low-flying plane made of wood and fabric.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> And so on.

While the Race does find the reproductive process pleasant when they're in heat, they find the idea of <em>always</em> being horny abhorrent and terrifying.

This includes informing the police of all threats and suspicious activity, using the research and development company he works for to develop technology to let him identify his tormentors over the phone, and making specific and detailed reports after each subsequent attempt on his life. This results in the arrest of four armed and dangerous individuals before they manage to make good on their threats, earns him and his company a large revenue stream and gratitude from the local police force, and the incarceration of the one person to actually get close enough to follow through on his threats.

One thing that surprises him is the relaxed attitude towards sexuality: his family goes to the theater to see a monster movie, and they're all quite surprised when it features an explicit sex scene between the monster and the female lead.

In his <em>very first scene</em> in the <em>Colonization</em> series he blackmails Goldfarb into working for him by threatening to kill his family. Britain in general has become more and more reliant on the Greater German <em>Reich</em> after it lost its empire, and the nation that once fought Hitler tooth-and-nail is now entertaining formally adopting the Fascist anti-semitic policies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise">Superweapon Surprise</a>: When the Race get ready to invade Britain, Churchill promises to unleash a new weapon the likes of which the Race have not seen before.

The only difference is that the compartments are designed for Race bodies and that the Race version is powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The human forces need to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> tactics (6-10 Panthers/Tigers per race tank, and the Americans count 10:1 as good odds) in order to triumph over the Race's more advanced weaponry.

Understandable, since the Race are raised in a communal fashion, with no known mothers or fathers, and are more generally 'domesticated' rather than 'raised' as we would think of it. Thus, Race children form no real bonds with any one particular 'parent' individual as they grow up. Friendship, however, is a powerful bond in the world of the Race, since they feel that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice">the people you choose to be close to</a> are much more important than the circumstances of who birthed you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyBoomstick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyBoomstick">This Is My Boomstick</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a>. The Race had assumed that advanced technology like nuclear weapons would seem like magic to Earth's primitive inhabitants. They're shocked when it turns out that humans have a pretty decent <em>theoretical</em> knowledge of the underlying scientific principles, they just don't know how to <em>manufacture</em> their own yet. Thus the nuclear destruction of Berlin and Washington, D.C. do not shock the human nations into submission as intended - instead it just makes them scramble to complete their own nuclear development programs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>: Forced by circumstance to be "the good guys" the story.

As such, humans need artificial finger-claws in order to operate the Race's machinery. Also, the Race's voice-activated appliances only respond to commands in their own language and have trouble with human accents (the Race have no different accents as everybody tries to speak the same way).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">Vichy Earth</a>: The Race attempt to achieve this, but only partly succeed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The United States</span>. They launch a nuclear missile at one of the Race's colonization ships, but beyond "killing a bunch of Lizards" there's really no rhyme or reason to it. They know it's only a single ship out of a massive fleet, meaning the damage inflicted will be statistically minor, and they have to realize that it will enrage the Race and lead to a retributive strike, but they make absolutely no attempt to frame any other country either to cover their own hides or to try and give one of their enemies a black eye. In the end it just comes off as petty and arbitrary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>: Despite the fact that they are united against a common enemy, the Axis and the Allies do not exactly like each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: The humans' way of fighting the Race (Well, that and guerilla warfare tactics.) Patton even says he is prepared to lose ten of his tanks to every Lizard tank he kills because that is still a favorable loss-ratio for the Human Alliance. This works in large part because the Race only has what they brought with them, at least until they start capturing human factories and adapting them to their own technology. The Race acknowledges this, particularly in a conversation where Atvar's adjutant says that he had a mental picture of them expending their last missile to take out the last human tank, only for another one to roll over the horizon. For that matter, they also acknowledge that some of their best technology is simply too advanced for repurposed human factories to build: they can make new bullets fitting for their own guns easily enough, but they can't make more guided smart missles. At least, not until the Colonization fleet arrives in the 1960s.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: A lot of characters, even major ones, disappear during each break in the series&mdash;understandable considering that the action spans roughly 90 years.

Thus they find the notion of romantic love to be confusing and disgusting.
