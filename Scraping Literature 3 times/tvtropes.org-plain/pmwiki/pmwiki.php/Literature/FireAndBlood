The ambiguity lies in the fact that Gyldayn all but states that with the exception of her brother/husband Aegon the Uncrowned, all of her carnal relationships were with women. Before and after the marriage. But Gyldayn <em>claims</em> she loved Aegon, which is the only reason to doubt she was a lesbian. She did <em>like</em> Aegon, and apparently "loved" him as her, er, brother - they did intend to rule together. But when it came to sex, it seems they had an open relationship: he was fond of other women, and so was she.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Ambiguous Situation</a>: A large portion of the book comes from second and third hand accounts of historical events, as well various legends, rumors and theories.

Tyland Lannister asks which boy that will be, given every other one is dead (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except Viserys, but no-one knew that at the time</span>).

Didn't stop him putting up a hell of a last fight, killing every one of Aegon's troops who got to him before Orys Baratheon did.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitTheDog">Bait the Dog</a>: After the Red Keep is finished, Maegor the Cruel throws the builders a surprisingly lavish party, with all the drink and debauchery they can handle.

The young daughter of one of the murderers told the king where they could be found and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">he had them disemboweled and left to die hanging from the castle walls</a>, refusing them the option to take the black. Apparently, at the sight of his friend's corpse, Jaehaerys momentarily looked so furious he was the spitting image of Maegor.</li><li> Before that, when a septon was angrily berating Jaehaerys for eloping and marrying his sister Alysanne, Jaehaerys shut the septon up by threatening to have his mouth sewn shut. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">All in a calm and even voice</a>.</li><li> Viserys I was generally confrontation-averse, but he made it clear that if anyone called Rhaenyra's kids bastards in front of him, he'd rip their tongues out. When Rhaenyra's first husband died, several of House Velaryon went to him to complain about her actions... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">mentioned it</a>.

She declared herself to be a special case since her father went out of his way to name her his heir. On the other hand this does serve to demonstrate the problem with Viserys naming her as heir.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization">Bowdlerization</a>: In-universe. Maesters copying down books have a tendency to edit out parts they disagree with, much to Gyldayn's irritation. And then there are some who go in the complete opposite direction.

In the end, he does neither, and after bringing Aegon II's murderers to justice, relinquishes power, and returns to Winterfell.

The Westerlands and Reach allied themselves to fight the Targeryen menace and marched a host of 55,000 soldiers toward the Aegonfort. In contrast, the Targaryens had around 11,000. Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya had their dragons light fires upwind of the combined host, causing smoke and heat to blow in on them. This caused horses to bolt and men to temporarily be blinded from the smoke. With the fire creeping in on all sides, the army broke, and the Targaryen force had little trouble eliminating the broken force, losing only around 100 men themselves. This marked the end of House Gardener (all of whom died from this battle in one way or another), led Loren Lannister to bend the knee, and played a large part in Torrhen Stark doing the same.</li><li> The Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. Prince Aegon Targaryen, eldest son of the late King Aenys, managed to rally a force of about 15,000 to try and depose his uncle Maegor (unfortunately, none of the Great Houses back him, as they want to be sure he can win a battle against his uncle). By the time they reach Harrenhal, intending to assault King's Landing, they're surrounded by six smaller armies loyal to Maegor, Aegon having refused to split his forces to try and destroy each enemy army before they could combine. Aegon took to the air atop his father's dragon Quicksilver, intending to both rally his forces and lead the attack, only for them both to be killed when Maegor himself attacked Aegon atop Balerion the Black Dread. With the Prince's death, his demoralized army was promptly annihilated by Maegor's loyalists.</li><li> The Fourth Dornish War, a.k.a. Prince Morion's Madness or the War of a Hundred Candles. The newly crowned Prince of Dorne, Morion Martell decided to launch an invasion of the Stormlands by sea, only to find that the Targaryens had had plenty of forewarning of his plans. King Jaehaerys and his two sons in their dragons burned every single ship in the Dornish fleet like a hundred candles, killing everyone on board. It was said to be the only war in history to be won without losing a single man.</li><li> Happens in a few other battles (frequently ones involving dragons). During the Dance of the Dragons, the Butcher's Ball is called "as decisive as any in the history of Westeros", when Criston Cole's exhausted army was cut off and totally destroyed by the remaining riverlands/northmen army. Averted, however, with the preceding Battle By the Lakeshore, aka the Fishfeed - the largest land battle of the entire war, which was a downright bloodbath for both sides. Technically it was a victory for Rhaenyra's side, as the combined armies of the Lannisters/westerlands were totally annihilated, functionally knocking them out of the war - but the riverlands/northmen army still lost over half of their own men in the process (which was one of the reasons they were in a take-no-prisoners mood at the subsequent Butcher's Ball).</li><li> The Battle of the Kingsroad, or the Muddy Mess, the last fight of the Dance, wherein the Tully host (supporting Rhaenrya) meets the forces of Lord Baratheon (Aegon II). It ends very quickly, and decisively, with Baratheon's troops being filled with arrows, and his reserve forces either running or turning to Lord Kermit Tully's side.</li><li> The disastrous efforts by Lady Johanna Lannister to drive the Ironborn off Fair Isle. Emboldened by an earlier victory at Kayce, Johanna dispatched soldiers hidden aboard a fleet of fishing boats and merchant ships, hoping to land on Fair Isle under the cover of night and take the Ironborn by surprise. Unfortunately, somehow word of the plan got out, the westerland fleet was ambushed and massacred by Greyjoy's ships, and Dalton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation">sent the heads of the Westerlands' commanders</a>, including Ser Erwin Lannister back to Casterly Rock to taunt Johanna.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCycleOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCycleOfEmpires">The Cycle of Empires</a>: Aegon's Conquest is the Expansion, where he takes over and gets everyone to bend the knee. Aenys and Maegor are somewhere between here and Stabilization, as they try (with mixed-to-poor results) to stabilize their rule. Jaehaerys I is straight-up Stabilization, spending fifty years keeping the peace and trying to make things better, generally seen as the best years Westeros ever has. Then Decay starts to set in with the reign of Viserys I, leading to the Dance of the Dragons, and the lacklustre reign of Aegon III that follows.

Despite this, and thanks to the stuff that happens later, she still gets slammed as a usurper forever. That said, it's debatable if Viserys really had the authority to go against standard succession laws to make his daughter heir, and the Greens were not the only side to commit atrocities in the Dance.<ul><li> Happens with Rhaenyra again when the Betrayal at Tumbletown is covered.

So when he died, some of them just shrugged and declared they never made any promise to support Rhaenrya.</li><li> Instead of biding his time and gradually bringing people round to the idea, Unwin Peake declared that Aegon III would marry his own daughter Myrielle <em>barely seven days</em> after the death of Queen Jaehaera. Obviously the lords of the realm slammed the brakes hard on that idea &mdash; even Grand Maester Munkun, otherwise Unwin's toady, saw just how opportunistic it looked &mdash; and Unwin had to agree to the Maiden's Day Ball where Aegon could choose his own bride. Then when the other regents thwarted his attempts to stop Aegon marrying Daenaera Velaryon, Unwin tried to make them cooperate by threatening to resign as Hand of the King.

After that, she and her son just sort of vanish.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheRomansHaveDoneForUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheRomansHaveDoneForUs">What the Romans Have Done for Us</a>:<ul><li> Aegon the Conqueror did rock up to Westeros with his dragons and flamed anyone who didn't bend the knee... but he also unified several kingdoms and brought about peace (mostly), where before the continent had been in a state of near-perpetual warfare, to the extent it couldn't go a year without someone going to war with someone else.</li><li> The chapters on the long reign of Jaehaerys include detailed descriptions of how Westeros as a whole benefited from the unified reign of the Targaryens, including many pragmatic improvements in infrastructure, law, etc. begun by Jaehaerys and Alysanne themselves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole">Who Murdered the Asshole?</a>: Maegor dies quite suddenly and mysteriously sitting on the Iron Throne. Nobody's sure who might've done it if it was murder, and given his management style there's no end of suspects, including the throne itself (as in the chair came alive and killed him).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace">Won the War, Lost the Peace</a>: By the end of the Dance of the Dragons, most of House Targaryen had been wiped out, leaving just a couple of traumatized children to take the throne. Most of the dragons were killed in the war, with the rest quickly dying off; rivalries new and old have emerged; the peace brought by the reigns of Aegon I and Jaehaerys I has been destroyed; and the corruption and power grabs that would plague the ruling powers of Westeros for almost two centuries were only just beginning.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: King's Landing, at least up until Jaehaerys's reign, was pretty awful, partly due to not so much being designed as congealed. Jaehaerys spent a good long part of his reign fancying up the city, or at least making it much less wretched (Flea Bottom excepted).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: Unwin Peake, Hand of the King, after manipulating bold young Alyn Velaryon into being the realm's grand admiral for his short-sighted but triumphant victory against the Braavosi, sends him to take care of the Red Kraken who had been raiding all along the western coast of Westeros since the Dance had begun. If he failed, the power of House Velaryon would be greatly diminished and he would be rid of a thorn in his side; if he succeeded, the Ironborn would be stopped. (But as it turned out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">one of the Red Kraken's salt wives instead murdered him in his sleep, and without him the Ironborn fleet fled back to the Iron Isles to determine who would next rule.</a>)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">You Shall Not Pass!</a>:<ul><li> A thirteen year old Prince Viserys, later Viserys II, when the Kingsguard come to arrest (and almost certainly kill) his pregnant wife for being a Lyseni, stands at the drawbridge to Maegor's Holdfast holding an axe, and tells Amaury Peake he's not getting in. Of course, he's against a group of armed men, so he hurries inside and leaves the job to Sandoq the Shadow. Thirteen men come to arrest his mistress. None of them make it across the drawbridge, and Amaury Peake's head gets split open like a melon.</li><li> When Rogar Baratheon ordered his men to seperate the newlywed Jaehaerys and Alysanne, Jaehaerys's Kingsguard stepped in the path of the Baratheon soldiers and bluntly stated anyone who tried to lay a hand on the King and Queen would die for it.</li><li> When a trio of Septas, offended by the Targaryen practice of incestuous marriage, tried to assassinate the pregnant Queen Alysanne in a bathhouse at Maidenpool, her maids, despite being naked and unarmed, flung themselves at the would-be assassins, holding them up long enough for the Kingsguard to arrive.</li></ul></li></ul>
