Miri has no training, and doesn't know it's impossible, so she does it.</li><li> Later in <em>Carpe Diem</em>, Shan does several equally impossible things during an astral excursion, and makes the same excuse... but the narration explicitly notes at one point that he knows perfectly well that what he's attempting is impossible (and is desperate enough to try anyway, whereupon it works).

However, some of them (such as Jeeves and, eventually, Bechimo) are legally recognized as sentient and sapient people in their own right. Another consideration is that AIs complicated enough to qualify as people can't be left to run on programming alone, but must be socialized just like biological people; Jeeves, who got a proper upbringing, is happy and very self-assured, but Bechimo, whom unforeseen circumstances forced out into the world before his education was complete, has a tendency to act like a needy, willful, and self-centered child. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Admiral Bunter, launched at the end of <em>Dragon Ship</em> with no socialization at all, is even worse.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAmongUs">Alien Among Us</a>: Inverted in <em>Carpe Diem</em>, when Val Con and Miri crash-land on a 1940s-equivalent human world and try to blend in until they can work out how to be rescued.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: In <em>Scout's Progress</em>, Daav yos'Phelium, Delm Korval and one of the most powerful people on the entire planet Liad, works as a lowly starship mechanic at Binjali's shipyard to get away from the pressures of rule.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeNumberSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeNumberSystem">Alternative Number System</a>: It's not explicitly stated that the Liadens have a base-12 numbering system, but they do use multiples of twelve in many applications, including timekeeping (12 days in a week), units of currency (they have several named units, each worth 12 times the one before), and the number they count up to when they're being patient with someone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatLittleGirlWasMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatLittleGirlWasMe">...And That Little Girl Was Me</a>: Near the end of <em>Balance of Trade</em>, Jethri's cousin Grig tells him a story about an expedition that encountered a cache of the Old Technology, and a young and inexperienced member of the expedition who was luckier than he deserved to be.

Prominent features of this code include the concepts of Balance, which holds that any action (whether harmful or beneficial) must be met with an equivalent response, and <em>melant'i</em>, which crosses "face"-like social status with separation of multiple roles held by a single person.

In fact, pilots (or at least most of the ones encountered in the books) are usually presented as a combination of long-haul trucker, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> fighter jock, samurai, and gunslinger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpockSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpockSpeak">Spock Speak</a>: Liadens speak in very polite and frequently roundabout form. This is in part because the stories often draw inspiration from Edwardian romances, and partly because Liadens are a culture where the slightest insult might provoke a lethal duel, depending on the temperament of the one insulted. It also frequently serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a> to give readers a sense of the formalized structure of the Liaden, especially High Liaden, tongue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a>: Moonhawk for Priscilla in <em>Conflict of Honors</em>; Moonhawk <em>and</em> Lute for Priscilla in "Moonphase"; Lute for Shan in <em>Plan B</em> (and Moonhawk for Shan in <em>I Dare</em>)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">Spot of Tea</a>: Liadens usually drink tea, while Terrans prefer coffee.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaffOfAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaffOfAuthority">Staff of Authority</a>: Each department chair at the University of Delgado has a staff of office.

(Though there are exceptions in both directions; the Liaden trade vessel <em>Daxflan</em> in <em>Conflict of Honors</em> is relatively small and utilitarian, and no preparation for the point-of-view character's later experience of the <em>Dutiful Passage</em>, while the Terran spaceliner in <em>Fledgling</em> is pretty swish.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryboardBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryboardBody">Storyboard Body</a>: All the Yxtrang</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperFunHappyThingOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperFunHappyThingOfDoom">Super-Fun Happy Thing of Doom</a>: The Department of the Interior, a secret Liad-supremacist terrorist conspiracy, is named for the department of the US government in charge of looking after national parks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Supersoldier</a>: the Yxtrang, Jela</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordCane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordCane">Sword Cane</a>: Professor Kiladi, Gallowglass Chair of Cultural Genetics at the University of Delgado, doesn't have a mere sword cane, he has a sword concealed in his professorial staff of office. It has not been established whether this is his own improvement or whether the staff of office was made like that in the first place. (The latter is not out of the question, considering that the Gallowglass Foundation was set up to support cultural genetics research and education following a series of incidents in which a nationalist organisation attempted to shut down a line of research they disapproved of using methods up to and including assassination.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotMotifs">Tarot Motifs</a>: In "Moon's Honor", each chapter is headed with the name of one of the Major Arcana and a brief description of what it signifies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotTroubles">Tarot Troubles</a>:<ul><li> "Moon's Honor" also has a scene in the fourth chapter featuring an actual tarot deck, which makes use of the common confusion about the meaning of the Death card.

Some of the individual cards are recognisable from their descriptions as variants of actual tarot cards (for instance, the card called The Burning House is a version of the tarot card called The Tower).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a>: The Dramliz and healers have this, as do lifemates. Sometimes they may have more trouble <em>not</em> listening to people's inner thoughts (as with Anthora and Theo in <em>Ghost Ship</em>). It's noted, though, that in most cases, this means being able to gain an impression of the other person's emotions and the shape of their thoughts, but not "hearing" their thoughts in verbal form the way telepathy is often depicted. The ability to hold mental conversations using actual words is something lifemates might develop in time; otherwise it's extremely rare.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoCoincidences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoCoincidences">There Are No Coincidences</a>: The Department of the Interior and its agents have a tendency to see conspiracy and collusion in everything Korval does, when actually it's just coincidence (or "the Luck") 99 times out of 100. (To be fair, though, Clan Korval is such a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidenceMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidenceMagnet">Coincidence Magnet</a> that the things that happen to them by coincidence would stretch the credulity even of someone who wasn't as incorrigibly paranoid as the Department.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">&iexcl;Three Amigos!</a>: Pat Rin, Cheever, and Natesa.

They use whatever name or title they're using to make it clear what <em>melant'i</em> they're operating under. When the Delm of Korval says "the Delm of Korval speaks," it means that right now, he is not your beloved brother, lover, or anything else; he's the guy who has to make decisions for the clan (in this case, this is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalWe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalWe">Royal "We"</a>). In a lighter example, when talking to Theo, her father tells her that while sometimes, "Professor Kiladi" needs to be trotted out on formal occasions, he asks her not to invoke "him" too often.<ul><li> When speaking the High Liaden tongue, Liaden often refer to themselves in the third person as "one," instead of "I".

It's pretty telling that Clan Korval has had this plan in reserve pretty much since they landed on the home planet.<ul><li> Plan B went on to also be the title of a novel showing the Clan acting on the Plan. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Fans kept asking them when <em>Plan B</em> was coming out, and they chose to take advantage of the name recognition when they found a publisher for future books in the series.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleIn">Title In</a>: In some of the books, each chapter begins with a heading stating where the first scene of the chapter is set, such as "Jelaza Kazone, Surebleak".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamele Waitley</span> in <em>Dragon Ship</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she rises above her naive ivory-tower absorption in her researches to realize she is being stalked&#151;and takes effective and unexpected action to get away.</span><ul><li> In <em>Dragon in Exile,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamele learns to shoot, and ends up taking down a mobster who has the poor sense to attack the shooting range where she is competing in a match.
