L. Stine</a>'s popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> series.</p><p>For '90s kids, this series was the first (or, if one avoided the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> Alternamorphs books, perhaps only) exposure they've had to the CYOA genre. Like other books in the genre, you, the reader, are required to make potentially dangerous choices to escape whatever dire circumstances you find yourself trapped in. Depending on the book, this may involve fleeing a haunted house, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">a deceptive genie</a> or escaping a carnival of horrors (i.e., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the book pictured to the right</a>). And of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">the possibility of lots and lots of grisly deaths</a>.</p><p>Most GYG books follow a format which splits the adventure into two separate paths. The primary one covers the book's advertised premise more closely. The secondary one usually centers on the aforementioned premise as well, but may focus on a different aspect of the quest. For example, the first book, <em>Escape from the Carnival of Horrors</em>, has you either going through the carnival games, or the carnival rides to make your escape. Other books have two different storylines only tangibly connected to each other. <em>Zapped in Space</em> (#23), for example, has you choosing between the advertised virtual reality space adventure or another virtual reality game, which involves a trek through a snowy tundra to hunt down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">an Abominable Snow Woman</a>. Few books, like <em>Checkout Time at the Dead End Hotel</em> (#27), go so far as to focus the entire book on one central quest.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In terms of overall design, <em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> doesn't deviate much from its spiritual CYOA predecessors, other than including references to other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> books. Usually, this involves a quiz question of some sort, though <em>Return to Terror Tower</em> and <em>Revenge of the Body Squeezers</em> continue where the original books left off (i.e., <em>Night at Terror Tower</em> and series 2000's <em>Invasion of the Body Squeezers</em>).</p><p>Because publishing company Scholastic forced R.L. Stine to write many volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> in a short period of time &mdash; like the main series itself &mdash; it's likely that several ghost writers wrote some <em>GYG</em> installments. As a result, the novels really vary in quality. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?name=Give+Yourself+Goosebumps">Demian's Gamebook<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=184">Web Page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, despite his obvious negative bias toward the series, does a decent job showcasing the erratic quality between each book. In contrast, <a class="urllink" href="http://mjnseifer.livejournal.com">a livejournal blog by MJN SEIFER<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> gives more detail and compassion for the series. However, it's not quite complete yet (it's only on book #37), and has not been updated since October 31st, 2012. Nevertheless, most <em>GYG</em> books are worth reading at least once, though some books feel more tightly constructed and exhibit better gameplay than others.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> lasted long enough to even have several Special Edition books. These eight CYOA novels emphasize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle">inventory management</a> and more complex gameplay gimmicks not present in the other books. <em>Into the Jaws of Doom</em> is the most notable example. With its split sections and chance encounters requiring dice rolls, it's the closest thing the series has to an actual gamebook. The other Special Edition books aren't as boldly ambitious, but they have other ways to surprise readers.</p><p>If you're interested in trying the series, many of the early books are now available on Amazon Kindle on the cheap.</p><p><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Yourself_Goosebumps#List_of_Give_Yourself_Goosebumps_books">The other wiki also listed the entire catalogue<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> novels.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> provides examples of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-C&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: According to illustrator Craig White, a forty-third book, which, based on the cover, would have had an arctic theme was in production for the main <em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> series, but never actually released.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts">Acme Products</a>: "Acme Cleanup" is mentioned in <em>The Creepy Creations of Professor Shock</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: The few times grownups are present, they don't do much besides punish you for acting panicked, lying about your unbelievable adventure, or sneaking off.<ul><li> This is averted in three of the storylines in <em>Weekend at Poison Lake</em>. One path in Storyline B (the ice cream hungry aliens) has you receiving help from Ben and JoJo, the ice cream manufacturers, when you explain what's happening because you're not the first person the aliens have messed with. In one of the endings for Storyline C (the stolen jewels), your character is saved from the Bittermans by the old woman screaming "Fire!" This causes the townspeople to gather at the lake, where they see you being attacked and rescue you. In one of the good endings for Story D (the Moss-man story) you telling your parents that you're being stalked leads to them calling the police and having the man arrested.</li><li> Also averted in one ending of <em>Escape From Horror House</em>, where your teacher helps you to defeat the poltergeists using magnets.</li><li> Played with in one ending of <em>Scary Birthday To You!</em> where the lady next door breaks up your birthday party, deciding it's getting out of hand, because your parents asked her to supervise and make sure everyone was safe. Sure, she ruined your party, but at least your parents asked someone to look out for you (whereas in most of the other books they happily sit back and let you wander into danger.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: One of the plots in <em>Tick Tock You're Dead!</em> involves you going only one day in the future, you then watch as your entire family, yourself included, gets run over by an out of control semi-truck while halfway across the street.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeExpress">Afterlife Express</a>: One bad ending in "Secret Agent Grandma" has you boarding a train, and realising too late that it is a train of ghosts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>: Several of the books have this for an ending, however, it varies on whether this is a good or a bad ending, as the former simply says you're safe, and the latter reveals you're going to have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">go through the adventure again</a>, for real this time. Some of the endings even go down the route of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream">Or Was It a Dream?</a>, which can also lead to a bad ending.<ul><li> Averted in one of the good endings from <em>The Knight In Screaming Armor</em> where your cousins believe you had a nightmare about the curse on your family, but you come across a pile of burned metal, proving it wasn't a dream.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom">Amusement Park of Doom</a>: <em>Escape from the Carnival of Horrors</em> and its sequel, <em>Return to the Carnival of Horrors</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>: Most books have at least one ending describing you getting permanently frozen into an immobilized state or morphing into an inanimate object. This includes (but not limited to): being turned into a statue, being turned into an art museum painting, being turned into a computer chip for a virtual reality game, etc. For obvious reasons, these tend to be the creepiest endings for each book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject">Animate Inanimate Object</a>: Mobile statues, mannequins, and six-foot displays coming to life aren't an uncommon occurrence in several books. <em>Toy Terror: Batteries Included</em> takes this trope to the extreme.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedTattoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedTattoo">Animated Tattoo</a>: One storyline of <em>Attack of the Beastly Babysitter</em> sees you stuck with a guy who has these and can, of course, use them as weapons and possibly kill you. One of the good endings involves you defeating him by destroying the main tattoo in the middle of his chest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Animorphism</a>: <em>Deep in the Jungle of Doom</em>, <em>Trapped in Bat Wing Hall</em> stand out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">showing the changed forms (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>-esque creature and a bat, respectively) on the cover.</span><ul><li> Both <em>The Deadly Experiments of Dr. Eeek</em> and <em>Under the Magician's Spell</em> include endings where you are turned into a dog.</li><li> <em>Alone in Snakebite Canyon</em> is <em>built</em> on this trope. Most of the bad endings involve you being turned into some kind of animal, including a mosquito, a bear, a tarantula, a mouse, a raven, a fish, a snake, and a kangaroo rat.</li><li> <em>Deep in the Jungle of Doom</em> includes endings where you turn into a monkey or a fish monster.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>: Many of the books give you one of these. Denny in <em>Tick Tock, You're Dead!</em>, Joanie in <em>Under the Magician's Spell</em>, Jen in <em>Escape From Horror House</em> and "Stinko" in <em>Attack of the Beastly Babysitter</em> are just a few examples.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: Fairly common in the books. Examples include the book sending someone or something to help you (for instance, if you get trapped on an island in <em>Scream of the Evil Genie</em>, a parrot arrives to help you find your way back), sending you back to choose again if you make an obviously wrong/foolish choice, or giving you useful information in certain bad endings so that you'll know what to do next time.<ul><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in "Into the Jaws of Doom", in which every bad ending contains a hint towards what would have been a better choice to take.</li><li> Also done twice in <em>Curse of The Creeping Coffin</em>:<ul><li> A bad ending tells you at the end that if you had asked the ghost of Elvira for help before making this choice, she would have told you not to make that choice and to ask her next time.</li><li> You have two choices for Keeper of the Sword. If you choose the wrong name, you should get a bad ending. However, the book points out that the ghost you saw was too young to be the character you chose. Then it straight out tells you you'll get a break and to go back and choose the other character.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>: In one ending of ''Escape From Camp Run-For-Your-Life", the people running the camp are arrested for kidnapping, conducting business with an alien government without a licence, and the most serious offence of all: not paying tax.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever</a>: In contrast to the titular <em>Purple Peanut Butter</em>, Eating the other food item, a stale chocolate cake (which might be laced with a certain green substance) makes the reader gigantic as opposed to tiny.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabysitterFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabysitterFromHell">Babysitter from Hell</a>: One of the premises for <em>Attack of the Beastly Babysitter</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta">Bad Santa</a>: A possible ending of <em>Trick or ... Trapped!</em> is that you end up in a sleigh with an evil version of Santa, who pushes you <em>out</em> of the sleigh to your death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>:<ul><li> On <em>Scream of the Evil Genie</em>, your wishes often don't work the way you hoped. Sometimes, it causes minor difficulties, but you're able to correct them without much difficulty. Often though, your less thoughtful wishes spark off some really bad things happening, including being stranded on a desert island, transporting a monster to your own house, or worst of all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">being trapped in a painting</a>.</li><li> In an ending in <em>Hocus Pocus Horror</em>; you can wish for a ton of gold, which the genie makes appear directly above you, so it kills you when it falls.</li><li> Happens in two endings of <em>Scary Birthday to You</em>! In one ending, after your birthday has been ruined, you blow out the candles on your cake and wish you could have had a better day - so you get sent back to the start of the book to do the story over again. In another, you're trapped with a sadistic entertainer holding you hostage, so you make a wish to be "as far away from him as possible" which sends you to the middle of a desert.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeTheBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeTheBall">Be the Ball</a>: One ending in <em>Escape From The Carnival of Horrors</em> forces you to play volley ball with some monsters.

The other hiding place, Dr. Eeek's office, is an equally bad idea, as it is Dr. Eeek you are hiding from, and he is obviously going to go into his office. Fortunately, the latter ending reveals that you were just having a nightmare.</li><li> One choice when faced with a carnivorous plant in <em>You're Plant Food!</em> is to kill it with weed spray, however, you realize too late, that this will kill you and your friend Kerry too, as you're all in an enclosed area, and would have to breathe in the toxin (the book itself tells you that you should have known this was very dangerous.)</li><li> In <em>The Twisted Tale of Tiki Island</em>, one part of the book has you and Ginny running away from mutated sea creatures, but the way out is blocked by an electronic door. You can either operate the numerical door panel, or pick up an eel to short out the panel. If you choose the former, you suddenly realize that there's no way you can figure out the code in the minute before the creatures catch up with you.</li><li> During the final confrontation in <em>Shop 'Til You Drop...Dead!</em>, in one scenario, you and Julie get your hands tangled by the heart attack backpack, and your mutated friend Reggie is marching towards you, ready to devour you. Your options are either to attack him, or stall him until 1 AM (when he'll change back as a human). If you choose to fight, Julie simply asks "how are we supposed to fight if our hands are caught in this stupid backpack?!" The book then remarks, "Good question.

At one point, should you try to run away and leave the dog to its doom, it attacks you while invisible and you get killed.</li><li> Some of the bad endings involve your friends or sibling/s turning on you after you have treated them poorly in some way. You may also get to bite <em>them</em> back in the good endings: for instance, <em>Tick Tock, You're Dead!</em> is based around you having to travel in time to find your bratty little brother, who ran off and got lost in a time travel experiment because he insisted "you're not the boss of me!" and wouldn't listen when you told him to stay put. One of the best endings is you being crowned king of a medieval kingdom, smugly saying that now you <em>are</em> the boss of him, and making him your slave.</li><li> One of the good endings of <em>Escape From the Carnival of Horrors</em> involves you using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">hard-to-earn</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Monster Blood</a> to defend yourself and your friends from the enemies who decided to kill you even though you had won The Final Challenge.

In one of the storylines of <em>Escape From Camp Run-For-Your-Life</em>, you're forced to team up with a girl you hate in order to survive (although many of the bad endings involve her leaving you to die to save her own skin.) In <em>Escape From Horror House</em>, one storyline involves you deciding whether to work with a medium or a ghostbuster in order to defeat poltergeists. The two hate each other and each accuses the other of being a fraud, but you have the option of making them work together just this once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression">Explosive Decompression</a>: One bad ending on <em>Tick Tock, You're Dead!</em> Oh, does the ending live up to this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilElevator">Evil Elevator</a>: <em>Shop Til You Drop...

Once you lose the game, you are instead killed by a <strong>purple</strong> tornado.</li><li> In "The Curse of the Cave Creatures" you agree to help a witch if she promises not to turn you into a frog, and she agrees. You save her, and she turns you into a snake, since you never said she couldn't do that. Another possible path/choice in the same book also has you try to stop a skeleton by pointing your magic wand at him and shouting "Stop skeleton!" but you accidentally hold the wand the wrong way, causing <em>you</em> to be affected by the spell instead since you have a skeleton underneath your skin too.</li><li> Even the books themselves do this; in "The Curse of the Creeping Coffin" there is a page where you have to throw the book in the air to determine if you survive a fall. If you do, you are killed by the ghost who you were trying to escape from when you fell, with the ending pointing out that the previous page only said you'd survive the fall, not the whole story.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Ship of Ghouls</em>, which revolves around a mad scientist's plot to blow up a cruise ship you're on, you can ... join the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">real</span> mad scientist, in which you two become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">really good golfers</a>.</li><li> In <em>Under the Magician's Spell</em> you may end up turning into the new Magician yourself (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheManiac">Clothes Make the Maniac</a> above).</li><li> The main choice you make in <em>All-Day Nightmare</em> will pit you against enemy secret agents, aliens, or werewolves. If you pick the latter, you can join a band of werewolf hunters, but you can also choose to become a werewolf yourself and hunt <em>them</em>.</li><li> One ending of <em>Into the Twister of Terror</em> is that you merge with the twister and have a great time destroying everything in your path.</li><li> In <em>The Curse of the Cave Creatures</em>, a certain choice during your battle with the Cave Spirit results in you becoming more powerful than him - causing you to switch bodies, because the Cave Spirit must <em>always</em> be the most powerful. You become evil and start plotting to kill him, as he is now in your human body.</li><li> <em>Please Don't Feed the Vampire!</em> has a story path where you decide you like being a vampire. You're pretty lousy at it, though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>: Make too many unwise choices, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">and you might run into a pair of choices that ends badly, no matter which one you choose</a>. For readers who didn't acquire certain items earlier in the adventure, when it comes time to use something to save yourself, you won't be able to do so. Sometimes, the books conceal the page number to make sure you actually ran into the item or piece of essential info instead of cheating and/or punish you for trying to cheat.<ul><li> <em>Deep In The Jungle Of Doom</em> has two times this happens.<ul><li> If you refuse to accept the help of a warrior tribe, you either get captured by then and have your heads shrunken, or you die in a tar pit.</li><li> If you find the tiger skeleton pit, you will either get killed by the tiger skeletons, or have to keep singing to keep from being attacked. This can happen in both storylines. In one storyline, you can get out of the pit before this ending, but it also leads to a bad ending.</li></ul></li><li> If you encounter the crocodile in <em>Diary Of A Mad Mummy</em>, you can either try to move past it, or toss it Fruity Bites. If you try to pass it, the crocodile will eat you. If you give it Fruity Bites, the crocodile starts following you around demanding more and eats you once you run out.</li><li> <em>Into the Jaws of Doom</em> does this trope very deviously for people who accidentally run into the giant magnet. To escape it, you need to discard <em>almost every item</em> you've acquired at that point. Only the boomerang gets a pass, but by that point of the game, you don't need it at all. This sets up an endless loop of bad endings, as the adventure's impossible to finish without the items you've left behind.</li><li> In <em>The Curse of the Creeping Coffin</em>, you can choose between fighting a Civil War soldier and a fencer. If you choose the Civil War soldier, you can get one of three endings. If you hide from him in the barn, you get bitten by a vampire chicken, and if you run to the bridge, you fall off. You have a fifty-fifty percent chance of surviving the fall. If you don't, you become a ghost and play pranks, including crossing out the page numbers of this very book. If you do, the ghost hears you groaning from your injuries and kills you. The book then clarifies that you had a chance of surviving the <em>fall</em>, not the book.</li><li> One of the two main storylines in <em>Little Comic Shop of Horrors</em> is to find that you are stuck in the world of comic books, and having to decide which of two comics you will enter. One of those gives you the option going into a third different comic, but all choices made from there end badly - you're either killed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> (who thinks you are a spy) or a team of other kids turned into comic book superheroes, who are angry that you accidentally caused one of them to get killed.</li><li> <em>Tick Tock, You're Dead!</em> has an entire storyline of this. Your main choice in the book is whether to go to the past or future to find your missing brother. If you go to the past, <em>all</em> paths lead to either a bad ending or the start of the future storyline. One of them does advise you to search in the future next time, just so the reader doesn't get too frustrated.</li><li> In <em>Revenge of the Body Squeezers</em>, if you end up on board the Body Squeezers' spaceship, you will get killed no matter what you do next.</li><li> Happens if you encounter Granny Kapusta in <em>Under the Magician's Spell</em>. She will either turn into a werewolf and eat you, or she gives you a glass of milk which magically immobilizes you and you discover she's going to cook and eat you.<ul><li> Even if you make the choice not to go into Granny Kapusta's house before you meet her, this still gives you a bad ending because of an earlier choice - you and your friend argue for so long that your little sister disappears completely.</li></ul></li><li> Some books use this trope by the fact that none of the endings, good or bad, allow you to reach the goal you set out to achieve. For instance, in <em>Ship of Ghouls</em> you're on a cruise that is supposed to take you to Japan for a vacation; even if you get one of the good endings, you never actually get to go to Japan.</li><li> "Story A" from "Night of a Thousand Claws" has no completely good ending. In the two endings where the reader wins, his or her parents will either become the new "Keeper of the Cats" or the reader himself/herself will turn into a dog.</li><li> Similarly, going with the "werewolf" storyline from <em>All-Day Nightmare</em> gives no real good ending: if you survive the book, you'll be a werewolf, a "were-hawk", or a regular wolf.</li><li> Playing Q Quest in "Return to the Carnival of Horrors" will end badly regardless of what number you pick. This is because A: You're told to pick a number between 8 and 14, but no matter what number you pick, you'll land on the skull image, and B: There's only one page you can go to and it leads to an ending where you're turned into a skeleton.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>: A subtle example is used on <em>Revenge of the Body Squeezers</em>.

Going with your gut turned out to be the better decision, as agreeing with your friend's "skin color doesn't matter" philosophy ended with both of you vandalizing Leonard Nimoy's cemented star with pick axes, and get you two thrown in jail, accomplishing nothing. As it turns out, this was part of your friend's plan, as she was a double agent for the blue aliens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxshadowing">Fauxshadowing</a>: In "Escape From the Carnival of Horrors" you can encounter a skeleton who warns you not to enter the House of Horrors or you'll end up like him, but none of the bad endings result in you becoming a skeleton. In the sequel, Return to the Carnival of Horrors, it is possible to become a skeleton if the wrong path is taken, but this has nothing to do with the House of Horrors at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding">Force Feeding</a>: One bad ending in <em>Trick or...

Not only can you discover numerous items, you can interact with them on multiple circumstances. You can even discard items if you feel like you won't need them any more. This flexibility comes with a price, of course. Grabbing some items <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent">triggers an event</a>, and if you don't have the proper item to counter said event (usually a monster appearance or death trap), you die. Some items aren't designed for multiple circumstances, and using them inappropriately will kill you. One item is completely useless, and if you choose it over a not-so-useless item, you're screwed. If you drop some items too early, you'll die when you'll need them later. If you haven't dropped enough items during one chase scene, the added weight will slow you down too much. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

One of the items will always be the default tool, though you can choose three others to aid you. Pick the wrong items or choose the worst time to use them, and you're dead.</li><li> <em>Trick or... Trapped!</em> has you searching for items throughout your quest and using them for the appropriate time. Unfortunately, the inventory system is so poorly implemented into the book, it doesn't enhance the experience.</li><li> <em>Shop Til You Drop... Dead!</em>'s scavenger hunt has you going through floors two through six, and acquire as many items as possible before hitting floor seven, the final showdown. Skipping some floors or doing some actions wrong causes you to grab some weaker replacement items- or not acquiring some items at all, which affects the final confrontation. Also, going through the scavenger hunt in the wrong order may get you killed in other floors, since you need those items to survive. On floor seven, at one point the books asks you if you have one item or the other. It's possible to have none of them, but that option isn't included on that page.</li><li> <em>You're Plant Food!</em> and <em>Zombie School</em> have scavenger hunts that work similarly, though not quite as good as the one in <em>Shop Till You Drop...

Alternatively, if you don't help him, he gets away and <em>you</em> get deboned.</li><li> In <em>Curse Of The Creeping Coffin</em>, allowing your ghost piano teacher to give you one last lesson gives you a particularly good ending, where she gives you a map to find her gold.

You need to know who the Keeper of the Sword is, but all she said is her name was Sarah, and there are two Sarahs in the graveyard. If you choose the wrong Sarah, the book reasons with you that the Sarah you chose was too old to be the ghost you saw earlier, but instead of giving you a bad ending, it gives you a chance to choose the right Sarah.</li><li> Similarly, if you think John Luckmeyer is the Keeper Of The Sword, the book gives you a quiz, and then explains if you answered TRUE to any of them, you should wait for the men in white coats to take you away.

Some specific offenders:<ul><li> <em>One Night in Payne House</em>. You choose three of twelve items, and if you choose even <em>one</em> wrong item or go one incorrect route, you'll hit a bad ending. It's next to impossible to beat this one without running into nearly every bad ending in the book.</li><li> <em>Weekend at Poison Lake</em> is this, literally. You pick between four short adventures based on Poison Lake, which comes with their own designated lucky number, and you decide how (or if) to use your lucky number during any perilous moment. Interesting concept, but the problem is that there was no logical way to deduct when to appropriately use your luck, as it could backfire at anytime. Yeah ... there's a reason this book wasn't well regarded.</li><li> In <em>Attack of the Beastly Babysitter</em> there is a spinner in the back of the book that initially decides which of the two main storylines you will follow: "Fun" or "Games." If you get Games, rather than letting you make choices, a lot of the paths are decided by actual games such as flipping a coin or rolling a dice, etc. You also have to use the spinner at other points in the storyline.</li><li> Most of the books will have at least one choice determined by something random the book asks you such as what day of the week it is, what month you were born, whether you have fair or dark hair, or are right or left-handed, etc.</li><li> In <em>Danger Time</em> you come up against the Zodiacs: representations of each star sign. Subsequently, certain choices are affected by your real life horoscope and, if you have the "wrong" sign, it's impossible to get around some of them without cheating.</li><li> <em>Zombie School</em>. You pick from a list of classes you have to survive, without getting too many "demerits" (and being sent to an automatic bad ending in detention.) Several important choices depend on factors like whether you can remember the last time you fell over in a gym class at school, or whether you are dressed correctly for the class you're supposed to be taking.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>: Several books in the series have mad scientists, just like the original <em>Goosebumps</em> books.

Some examples:<ul><li> <em>Zapped in Space</em>:<ul><li> You have to get across a planet's surface without being cooked by the intense alien sun's heat. You're in a greenhouse, with two options &mdash; slather yourself with random goo, hoping it's sunscreen, or make a hat out of leaves. If you use leaves, the leaves have lenses in them you didn't notice, which cook you.</li><li> When you're fending off alien lizards, you can either use a sword, or a gun you have no clue how to operate. If you use the sword, the Lizards unveil their uncanny ability to regain all lost limbs, including their heads. FUUUUUUU&mdash;</li><li> When you and your friend reach the Abominable Snowman's cave, there's a table with a box, containing a magnifying glass and a compass, saying "Take one". Logically speaking, since there are two of you, you and your partner can take both items <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">without breaking the rule</a>. Unfortunately, a beam of sunlight bounces off the compass through the magnifying glass, which flash defrosts the cavern and buries you and your friend into an avalanche of snow. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">What</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Into the Jaws of Doom</em>: You're running from a man with no skin who's trying to kill you inside a museum. You need to kill him so you can use the stairs again and get to the third floor. You're in the gift shop along with a chemistry set, as well as a fire extinguisher you found previously. If you try to kill him by exposing him to the extinguishers intense cold, the recoil knocks you out and he strangles you. If you try to make the smoke bomb, a bad mixture causes it to blow up in your face. You make a noise bomb, he's still not incapacitated but you are. You make a stink bomb, you both suffocate. And no, there is no option to just kick him in the overly exposed balls. You're supposed to go into a maze, find the right direction without coming across the giant magnet that takes everything away from you permanently, find the laser gun guarded by the snake, throw a stinkbomb at the creature that likely wouldn't be bothered by it, take the laser, find your way out, and shoot the skinless man in the eyes to blind him so he falls down the steps, presumably knocking himself out. It's probably worth noting, the smoke bomb and the flash grenade do absolutely nothing positive and stop you from making the stink bomb, making the game unwinnable. <br><br>Cheap endings aside (the germ and smoke bomb ones come to mind), <em>Into the Jaws of Doom</em> has more internal consistency than most other books in the series. As for the "Visible Man" stalking you, the book gives you specific instructions on how to beat him if you were paying attention. First, if you were lucky enough to get the hint about needing the fire extinguisher back in the fourth floor, you'll know to keep it for the fire ants when reaching the third floor (and even if you didn't, it's simple to figure out anyway). After snagging the key that was contained in the ant farm and you use it to open up the gift shop, your friend P.D.A. contacts you though a walkie-talkie and specifically tells you that only the Laser will work on the Visible Man, which is located in the giant mirror maze. The noise bomb is useless, but the intro in the book warned you that some items are worthless by design, so no loose logic here. The intro also said that most items are only good to use once, and using them multiple times may do more harm than good (only the fire extinguisher can be successfully used twice...the other times, it's worthless). Lastly, avoiding the giant magnet was easy, assuming you checked your notebook map on floor three and learn not to go north too often (though it's pretty tough to hit the giant magnet).</li><li> <em>Diary of a Mad Mummy</em>: You are in Egypt, being attacked by a crocodile. The book asks you if you are carrying some gummy candy to distract the crocodile. If you don't it kills you. If you <em>do</em>... he follow you around to get fed more, and you know one day you'll run out, and the croc will have to find something (or someone) else to eat...</li><li> <em>The Knight in Screaming Armor</em>: You're being chased up a bell tower by some ghost monks, who want to make you one of them. You reach the bell, and there is a kettle of black liquid, which probably won't even harm ghosts, and when you reach for the bell, the monks cower, which means they obviously fear the bell for some reason, so naturally you next choice is to ring the bell. No! What you're meant to do is pick up the kettle, which is too heavy for you, and then fall over and ring the bell by accident! Pulling the rope to ring the bell causes it to break, giving the monks time to catch up to you...</li><li> <em>Please Don't Feed The Vampire</em>: You have been turned into a vampire and are faint from lack of blood. You are trapped in a room with other vampires who start drinking from the Dracula <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>. You can either try to escape while they're distracted, or drink some of the blood (not an unreasonable choice to make, since your character is now a vampire and needs blood.) But if you pick the latter, the next page abruptly breaks the fourth wall, assuming YOU in the real world want to drink someone's blood; and tells you to put the book down and stop being creepy.</li><li> <em>Invaders From the Big Screen</em> has one choice determined by whether or not you know the meaning of the word "pince-nez", but you continue with the story only if you <em>don't</em> know &mdash; if you do, you get a bad ending. A similar thing happens in <em>Welcome To The Wicked Wax Museum</em>, where you can only avoid a bad ending if you can't find your lifeline on your palm. If you can, you notice it's shorter than it used to be, and you end up dead.</li><li> At one point in <em>Shop Till You Drop ... Dead!</em> you can be captured inside a store by mannequin security guards, who put you on "trial" and ask whether you plead Guilty or Not Guilty. Pick Not Guilty, and the mannequins "reward" your innocence ... by turning you into a mannequin just like them. Pleading Guilty, on the other hand, leads to them "punishing" you with the worst thing they can imagine - banishing you from the deadly, haunted department store you're trying to escape from.</li><li> In one scenario of <em>All-Day Nightmare</em>, you've had your memories erased and have learned that you are a secret agent. You vaguely recall that pressing a button on one of your gadgets will summon paratroopers to help you, but aren't sure <em>which</em> button. The book gives you a choice of two: EMER or PARA. If you go with the obvious choice of PARA, this actually <em>paralyzes</em> you, and the bad guys will get you. (EMER was short for EMERGENCY and is the right choice.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>: Not a common occurrence, but some books force you into a pair of unpleasant choices that both end in a similar disaster for you, the reader.<ul><li> <em>Alone in Snakebite Canyon</em> at one point presents a pair of animal morphs that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">even the book admits sound less-than-ideal</a>: a slow-as-molasses tarantula morph to cross a busy street, or a mosquito morph through a bat infested cave, right after you ate a mosquito when you were in bat morph minutes earlier. The choices end as well as you expect. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">The logical third option</a> - i.e., turn into a tarantula and wait in the cave until the snake eyes reset into two other and presumably better animal choices &mdash; was completely absent.</li><li> <em>The Werewolf of Twisted Tree Lodge</em> presents an interesting scenario when you're trapped in the middle of the woods, facing a bunch of creatures that could easily eviscerate you for their own amusement. One option is to trick them into playing a game of tag and running like hell to escape, but they easily catch up and kill you. The alternative? Convince them that they'd all turn on each other if they try to eat you, because they're all different creatures, and require different needs when it comes to eating humans. By doing that, they'd either let you live to prevent turning on each other, or go all divide and conquer to see who gets to eat you. Instead, they claim that they're diplomatic monsters, and that their different needs doesn't interfere at all with feeding on you, so you still wind up dead.</li><li> <em>Diary of a Mad Mummy</em>, if you get trapped with the crocodile in Egypt. He either eats you right away, or you stall by giving the crocodile gummy snacks. Unfortunately, since there's no rescue on the horizon, you'll eventually get eaten anyway after the snacks run out.</li><li> Being reasonable in a book about trying to stop a mad scientist's plot to experiment on a cruise ship you are on and trying to escape with your friend gets you stranded in the ocean after managing to get to the outer decks, all because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">gave you a friendly slap on the back, causing your cable lubricant-soaked body to barrel over the railing and into the sea.</a> The other choices make you kickstart the plot by reporting the only person capable of stopping the conspiracy.</li><li> In <em>Escape from the Carnival of Horrors</em>, you may encounter Slappy, the evil dummy from the <em>Night of the Living Dummy</em> books in the main Goosebumps series. You will then be asked if you remember the spell that was used to wake Slappy in the books. Whatever happens next ends badly for you: the right spell causes you to be enslaved to Slappy, while the wrong spell turns you into a chicken.</li><li> <em>Night of a Thousand Claws</em>: You have been cornered and are about to be devoured by ghost cats. The book then presents you with a wordsearch puzzle to determine whether you'll survive. If you don't solve the puzzle, the cats eat you, and you are told it's your own fault for being too lazy to solve a simple puzzle. If you <em>do</em> solve it ... the cats eat you anyway, because you were too absorbed in the puzzle to notice them advancing on you.</li><li> <em>You're Plant Food!</em>:<ul><li> At one point you can be trapped with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who's trying to kill you. Your choices are to throw a random chemical in their face, or flip over the lab table to slow them down. The chemical turns out to be harmless, so the scientist catches you. Flipping the table injures the scientist, giving you time to escape &mdash; but the remote control for the mechanical door gets crushed in the wreckage, so you're still trapped with the scientist who could wake up at any time.</li><li> Your friend is being held captive in a plant's tendrils, and you're given the choice of using hedge shears or weedkiller spray to free her. Using the shears causes the plant to eat first the shears, and then you. Use the weedkiller, you're overcome by fumes (and apparently die) with the book scolding you for thinking it was safe to use poisonous chemicals in an enclosed space.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Deep in the Jungle of Doom</em> you can get trapped in a pit with two living tiger skeletons (Wait, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">tigers, in the Amazon? They're supposed to be jaguar skeletons!</a>). Your only choices are to try to jump out of the pit, and escape by jumping on one of the tiger skeletons, and then out of the pit, or to sing to the skeletons to calm them down. The former leaves you too badly injured to move, as the skeleton breaks the second you land on it (you automatically kill the other one with your remaining good leg), and the latter works at first, but you soon realize that the second you stop singing the skeletons will want to kill you again. Ironically, both endings imply there should be a way out of this; simply sing to the skeletons and then kick them, but there is no third option.</li><li> <em>Under The Magician's Spell</em>:<ul><li> You can get involved in a card game, which if you lose, you have to polish rhinestones on the winner's suit, and if you win, you find out you're playing "Five Hundred Card Draw" meaning you have to win 499 more times before you proceed. Ironically this is the first time the "Card Draw" (which you have to do in real life) was used in Goosebumps - in a choice that affects nothing!</li><li> You can get trapped in a room, but have the nagging feeling that your little sister hinted towards an exit unknowingly. If you can't figure it out, you stay in the room, meaning the Magician will return and kill all of you. If you <strong>do</strong> figure it out, you escape through a hidden trap door, but get talked into a knife throwing act, which ends badly for you.</li><li> As before, you are trapped in a room, but a giant appears and asks you to follow him. If you refuse to do so, he will cry so hard that the entire room floods, and you all drown, but if you follow... well, it isn't actually clear what happens, but the book seems to imply you will be turned into a dummy.</li><li> Stuck with an old lady who promises to take care of you, she offers you a glass of milk. If you accept, you become immobilized, and she plans to use your knees in her cooking. If you decline, she turns into a werewolf and attacks you.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Zombie School</em>:<ul><li> You have been sent to detention and brainwashed into a zombie. The teacher then sends you back to class because your punishment is to spy on other students and report them if they start to think for themselves. You overhear some kids talking about how weird the school is, and have to decide whether or not you'll try to fight the mind control. If you do, you let them escape, but it is implied your head will explode because you weren't supposed to be able to do this. If you don't, you turn them in. They are taken away to be brainwashed just like you, and the book insults you for being a snitch.</li><li> If you go with the Book's "B" storyline (requiring you to pick from a list of classes which you have to survive), pretty much all choices turn out to be this. They will either lead to a bad ending (where you usually get killed), or earning a bunch of "Demerits" which invariably push you towards doom in the Detention Room.</li></ul></li><li> No fewer than four examples in <em>Into the Twister of Terror</em>:<ul><li> You discover that the twister is part of a movie being made by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Steven Spielberg. He then offers you a part in the movie. If you accept, you're killed during filming when the wind machine sucks you into a pit of sharp objects - the director ignored your screams because he thought it was part of the script. If you say no, he then casts your aunt and uncle (with whom you live) in the movie instead, and they go to Hollywood and become famous, leaving you to run their farm.</li><li> A wind spirit is controlling the twister, and is angry that you did not give back a doll you stole from him. Your choices are to apologize, or tell him that you didn't understand his culture. Pick the former and he pretends to take you home, but drops you in mid-air and gives a fake "apology." Pick the latter, he sends you 500 years back in time and you have no way of getting back.</li><li> You have been cornered by talking animals who want to destroy humanity, and kill you so you can't warn others. They chase you to an abandoned school. If you go into the school building, you're killed by laboratory animals inside (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</a>.) If you go into the school bus, the talking animals easily break in and kill you.</li><li> You have to decide what to do with a magical flying carpet to help you escape the twister. If you talk to the carpet, it tries to fly you to safety, but the twister flips it over and you plummet to your death. If you try to find another way, the genie of the carpet tricks you into switching places with him inside a bottle.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Curse of the Cave Creatures</em>, you can end up stranded in a Lost Land where the populace is being terrorized by a giant mastodon. If you choose to attack the mastodon with a heavy mace, it gets knocked out but you also end up crushed to death underneath its massive body. If you choose to attack it with a small knife that's said to inexplicably terrify him, it gets so terrified that it accidentally rams into its lair's entrance, completely caving it in &mdash; and a horrified onlooker from the lost civilization tells you that entrance was the only possible way for you and them to return to the outside world and it'd take them over a hundred years to clear it out.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicSoothesTheSavageBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicSoothesTheSavageBeast">Music Soothes the Savage Beast</a>: Often employed, but things don't always go according to plan for the reader.<ul><li> One choice when faced with the tiger skeletons in <em>Deep in the Jungle of Doom</em> is to sing to them. This works, but the second you stop they are no longer soothed, so you have to keep singing to them forever if you want to live.</li><li> In <em>Trick or ... Trapped!</em> you can try this trope on The Thing (and it's even called by name), and you are given a choice of instruments.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N-S&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATitle">Never Trust a Title</a>:<ul><li> Nowhere in <em>Escape From Horror House</em> are you required to escape from a house &mdash; the story is based around you getting rid of poltergeists that have invaded a house.</li><li> The titular elevator in <em>Elevator to Nowhere</em> does take you somewhere; you use it to travel to other dimensions.</li><li> The title <em>Invaders from the Big Screen</em> implies that movie characters are going to escape from the cinema screen, and invade the real world.

The closest you'll get are mutant fish creatures.</li><li> <em>Scream of the Evil Genie</em> doesn't feature an evil genie; Jenna, the titular genie, is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> who's just fed up with having to grant people's wishes.

You turn towards it, travel down another never ending tunnel until you hear another voice ... and turn back the way you came.<ul><li> <em>One Night in Payne House</em> has an "ending" where you run screaming through the house after someone startles you. The book then tells you that your friend was responsible - but the story just ends there abruptly without explaining <em>why</em> it's the end.</li><li> In <em>Night in Werewolf Woods</em>, pressing a button marked STOP literally stops the story there and you can't go on any further.</li><li> Also in <em>Night in Werewolf Woods"</em>, there is one "ending" where you are told by some ants (via sign language) that they mean you and your friends no harm, but there is another enemy in the woods that you haven't seen yet, but then the book ends, even though you have not yet achieved anything, and seemed like it was just starting.</li><li> In ''Checkout Time at the Dead-End Hotel", choosing to drink clam juice will lead to the book telling you that clam juice can cause strange affects on people, such as causing the books they're reading to have missing letters.

If you make a wrong choice, the book will sometimes allow you to avoid a bad ending, but then send you back to the first page to start the story again with a different inventory.<ul><li> In one case, information gained from one such wrong ending is necessary to survive the final confrontation, so it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in this case.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Tick Tock, You're Dead!</em> has an ending where you choose to stay and watch a dinosaur hatch, only to find that you were watching a prehistoric chicken hatch. For some reason, this is an ending even though there's nothing to imply that the book ended at this point.</li><li> One ending of <em>Diary of a Mad Mummy</em> has you accidentally drink something that was drugged, so you lose consciousness and wake up to find that the diary was stolen. The story ends there and you're told that without the diary you can't go on any further, since the whole book is <em>about</em> the diary.</li><li> In <em>Secret Agent Grandma</em>, you and your grandmother think that someone is lurking in wait for you inside the bathroom on a train, so you open the door - but someone rushes past you wanting to use the bathroom, and knocks you over, causing Grandma's spy gadget to land in the toilet bowl. You're told that this is the end, although it's not explained why, and this seemed more like a cliffhanger than an ending.</li><li> Should you choose to press a button marked "Time Loop" within <em>Danger Time</em>, you're disappointed to find that the button doesn't do anything - so you press it again, and again, and again and the book ends there.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">No Fair Cheating</a>: In the 'Abominable Snow Woman' path in <em>Zapped In Space</em>, at one point, you need to go through a maze, leading to 2 page numbers, the end of the maze, so to speak. However, you can actually only reach one if you were to do the maze. If you rely on blind guessing and guess the wrong page, then the Snow Woman will show up, declare you cheated, and trap you in the game for good. Something similar happens in <em>Attack Of The Beastly Babysitter.</em><ul><li> <em>One Night in Payne House</em> and <em>Trick or ... Trapped!</em>, which use an inventory puzzle, both have endings that punish you if you claim to have picked up an item that it's not possible for you to have acquired.</li><li> <em>The Twisted Tale of Tiki Island</em> asks you to complete a maze when you are captured by an octopus. The maze has one opening and one fake opening. If you don't bother to do the maze and choose the fake one, the book tells you off for cheating and you end up turning into an octopus when you bite the one attacking you.</li><li> The maze in <em>Attack Of The Beastly Babysitter</em> also does this, telling you that you would have known that was the wrong exit if you'd bothered to do the maze and you end up buried in rats.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</a>: While mainstream media often tell you that you must treat others the way you want to be treated, <em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> series will teach you that there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">vile beings that not even kindness would reach</a>. If you do not thread carefully, prepare for some Bad Endings.<ul><li> A devious example came up in <em>Into the Twister of Terror</em>. During one sideplot, talking animals hunt you down, because you figured out a secret that they don't want any human to know. You try to reason with them a few times to no avail, and they eventually trap you inside a abandoned school. You decide to release a bunch of small animals that were trapped behind cages and glass habitats as a sign that you're a trustworthy human.

You think that a dog he was holding captive is now hidden inside his bag of tricks; but you decide not to take the bag with you, because you believe it's wrong to steal. This punishes you with a bad ending by having the now-invisible dog attack and presumably kill you - even though you were trying to do the <em>right</em> thing by not stealing, and you didn't even know for certain that the dog was in the bag.</li><li> In <em>Deep in the Jungle of Doom</em>, you and your friend Zoe are about to enter a suspicious-looking cavern. If you chose to go first and provide cover for Zoe, you will be ambushed and eaten by a vicious monster as Zoe betrays you to save herself.</li><li> While ignoring your friend's advice may seems like a bad idea, sometimes trusting your friend's words without skeptic thought leads you to Bad End, either because they don't know any better or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">they are trying to backstab you</a>.

Examples include <em>Please Don't Feed the Vampire</em> (where refusing to ring your neighbor's doorbell leads to you being told you are too much of a wimp for the story to go on any more), <em>Scary Birthday To You!</em> (if you choose to talk it out reasonably with the insane entertainer holding you and your friends hostage, you cannot continue because the book says it should have been obvious that there was no way he would ever play fair with you) and <em>One Night in Payne House</em> (if you don't know a certain clue from a <em>Goosebumps</em> book, you can't continue any further as the clue is essential to surviving the story.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMyDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMyDriver">Not My Driver</a>: <em>Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum</em>, <em>Night of a Thousand Claws</em>, and a few others have bad endings where you get into a car that the villain is driving.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingPantsDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingPantsDream">"Not Wearing Pants" Dream</a>: In one bad ending of <em>It's Only A Nightmare</em>, you confront Lord Morphos on a stage in front of a packed auditorium, only to suddenly find yourself in just your underwear.

Most of the events don't exactly make sense <em>or</em> converge with any kind of internal consistency, which makes many of these books feel quite arbitrary with any quest. There <em>are</em> exceptions, but the bulk of the novels tend to go this route.<ul><li> <em>Weekend at Poison Lake</em> doesn't even hide this, since the trope <em>IS</em> part of the book's premise.</li><li> <em>Into the Twister of Terror</em> is one extreme example. The book contains several sideplots that go in many different directions with no cohesive center to tie all the madness together. Even the origin of the twister that causes all these events vary wildly between quests.</li><li> <em>It's Only a Nightmare!</em> tends to randomly shift from event to event, so much so it's difficult to determine what choice will do what (even more so than normally). Kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as the book takes place in a dream world most of the time.</li><li> <em>Trick Or ...

The closest <em>GYG</em> came to reflecting <em>Hark</em>'s game design was <em>Into the Jaws of Doom</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">Spot the Imposter</a>: Happens twice in <em>Secret Agent Grandma</em>, first you have to decide which of the two grandmas is the real one to determine which storyline you will take part in, and later in one of them you have to deal with the more traditional version of the trope with both grandmas warning you that the other is fake, and having to choose.<ul><li> A plot point in <em>Checkout Time at the Dead-End Hotel</em> is the reader having to decide which of two people is Drew Mortegarth, who has promised to help you escape. But because the reader has never met Drew (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Drew's name leaves their gender ambiguous</a>), picking out the real one may prove difficult.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrippedToTheBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrippedToTheBone">Stripped to the Bone</a>: "Return to Terror Tower" has an ending where living skeletons (who were burned alive by a dragon) skin you alive so they can have your skin.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder4" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a>: Used several times as an ending in the books. In <em>The Curse of the Creeping Coffin</em> you are turned into a statue and ghosts 'tease you and pinch your stone nose' until the end of time. In <em>Shop Till You Drop... Dead!</em> two endings turn you into a mannequin and a cardboard cutout.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">This Loser Is You</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum</em>, choosing to not go down a corridor gives you a happy ending, but at the cost of the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> to insult your cowardice. For <em>several paragraphs</em>. Of course, this being an R.L. Stine book, going down the corridor gets you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">decapitated</a></span>.</li><li> Several books will allow you to make a "safe" choice, but the book will mock you for being too chicken to take any risks, and usually punish you in-story. For example, if in <em>Into the Twister of Terror</em> you choose to go into the storm cellar during a hurricane rather than search for your dog, you get out safely but are told what a wimp you are and that as a result, you didn't get to have any adventures. In <em>Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum</em>, if you don't follow your friends into a car (the three of you had broken away from the group during a school trip), the book again insults you, and then your teacher catches you and calls your parents.</li><li> You may also be scolded by the book if you don't complete a puzzle successfully (such as <em>Night of a Thousand Claws</em>; you have to make a list of words from the phrase "Spiral staircase", and if you don't get enough, the book insults you for your laziness in getting such a simple task wrong) or if you deliberately cheat in a scavenger hunt/inventory (<em>Into the Jaws of Doom</em>, <em>One Night in Payne House</em>).</li><li> <em>Please Don't Feed the Vampire!</em> has an ending where, if you refuse to ring a neighbor's doorbell and ask your friend to do it, you are told the story has ended because you are simply too much of a wimp for it to go on any further.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice">Time Police</a>: In the book <em>Danger Time</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Stands Still</a>:<ul><li> In <em>The Curse of the Cave Creatures</em>, one of the talismans you can choose on the Spell Caster path is a watch that can stop time. However, it turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">the most useless talisman you can pick</a>, because the only two times you can use it result in either the watch breaking and freezing you in time forever or it not solving your biggest problem of being trapped in a pit in the middle of the desert.</li><li> In <em>The Knight In Screaming Armor</em>, you can find a three-faced clock. You can then learn the hard way in one bad ending that the handless face of that clock stops time forever if you touch it.</li><li> One bad ending of <em>Danger Time</em> involves you being frozen forever in time when you accidentally break a watch that controls the flow of time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>:<ul><li> Done in <em>Tick Tock, You're Dead!</em> and <em>Danger Time</em>.</li><li> One ending in <em>Revenge of the Body Squeezers</em> has a spaceship accidentally transporting you to the 1960s.</li><li> Annoying a wind deity in <em>Into the Twister of Terror</em> gets you sent back hundreds of years in time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: Pretty much all of the books have at least one ending like this.<ul><li> In the one good ending of <em>One Night in Payne House</em>, you and your friend Trevor managed to escape Payne House, but both of you would've died without the help of two trick-or-treating teens helping you out of the house when you two were dangling from a white sheet. When both of you try to convince them that you survived the worst ordeal, and were bummed out that they didn't believe you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">you two dare each other to go back in and get some proof so people will believe you, despite nearly dying that night in so many ways</a>.</li><li> A particularly bad example happens in <em>Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum</em> where, in a wax museum that you know is full of <em>living</em> wax figures, you stand in front of a statue of a serial killer while bragging that no one would ever murder a nice kid like you ...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyHalves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyHalves">Too Many Halves</a>: One bad ending in <em>The Deadly Experiments of Dr. Eeek</em> has Dr. Eeek discovering the reader after they try to hide under the poorly covered operating table. The deranged doctor then turns the reader into part kid, part dog, and part basketball.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Transformation Trinket</a>: Eating the dog food in Dr. Eek's lab in <em>The Deadly Experiments of Dr. Eek</em> turns you into a German shepherd.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>:<ul><li> An equivalent. Sometimes the book will let you do something immoral, but you are almost always punished with a bad ending. These range from humiliating or self-defeating (in <em>Diary of a Mad Mummy</em>, if you try to leave your six-year-old sister to be killed by the mummy, he calls you out on it and then takes her to safety and makes her rich and famous) to fatal (in <em>Hocus-Pocus Horror</em>, if you try to abandon the dog you were supposed to rescue and save your own skin, the dog will attack and kill you.)</li><li> Another example is <em>Welcome To The Wicked Wax Museum</em>. It gives you a chance to save Axel from the Deboner. You have to make the choice twice, as your friend doesn't want to, but if you don't, he somehow gets away and you become deboned instead. Consequently, if you save Axel, he gives you an object you may need later on.</li><li> Averted in <em>Night in Werewolf Woods</em> when Sharkey and his brothers are being cornered by werewolves, as choosing to save them leads to a bad ending.</li><li> Also averted in <em>Scary Birthday to You!</em> where the only way to get a good ending in one situation is if you choose not to save your friend who's trapped in a ballroom with dancing ghosts. The book tells you it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">his own fault for being boring enough to be interested in ballroom dance.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">Viewers Are Goldfish</a>:<ul><li> <em>Zapped in Space</em> uses this against you in the Abominable Snow Woman storyline. In one part of the book, the right clue to advance in the game was given away with the game's poster when you entered the arcade way back in page 3 or 4. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">There was a minor description of the lights' colors near the game's poster that was irrelevant at the time</a>, but was a major clue for later. This effect is magnified if you do the Abominable Snow Woman storyline <em>second</em>. Unless you have a sharp memory or cheated to see the answer, you'll have to guess the right colors for the lights. Guess wrong, and you'll be led in the wrong direction.</li><li> <em>Ships of Ghouls</em> during the stranded-at-sea plot mentioned a miniature a magnet that you used to create a substitute compass to find your way back home. By this point, most readers forgot about the part when you grabbed the magnet, so the book referenced the page where you picked it up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>: Often, the risky options (such as fighting the monster, where you suddenly gain incredible athletic abilities beyond that of a normal kid) are the correct ones, while the safe options lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> (e.g. walking directly through a puddle leads you to the other side, while walking around it inexplicably leads to the puddle being much deeper and containing a bog monster that pulls you in by the tongue). There are even times where the immoral option (such as lying, being greedy, or abandoning your partner) gets you the good ending.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn">The Walls Are Closing In</a>: Happens to you in <em>One Night In Payne House</em> when you encounter the Pink Room and need to have brought the right item to free yourself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>: One of the really good endings for <em>Trapped In Bat Wing Hall</em> if you pick the red team storyline is that, by successfully completing the scavenger hunt, you've transformed Nick, Debbie, and Connor into humans. Nick then starts telling a story about a group of kids who were turned into monsters and could only be saved if someone completed a really dangerous hunt...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">We Cannot Go On Without You</a>: <em>Night in Werewolf Woods</em> contains a scene where you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">choose to let your friend Todd fall into a bottomless pit.</a> If you do, the book immediately ends without explanation, not even calling you out for letting him fall.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst">Who's on First?</a>: In <em>Little Comic Shop of Horrors</em>, you ask a Professor X parody called Professor Y why he wants to destroy the possibly visitor, which leads to one of these.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWantOurJerkBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWantOurJerkBack">We Want Our Jerk Back</a>: <em>Tick, Tock, You're Dead!</em> is an example of this trope. The jerk is "your" brother.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">With Friends Like These...</a>: Sometimes, your friends don't make you feel appreciated in a bad situation.<ul><li> In <em>Scary Birthday To You!</em>, if you volunteer to stay at your house so everyone else can do the scavenger hunt, they leave you behind with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Death</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">with no intentions of coming back.</a> Fortunately, the story doesn't end badly on your end, since you offer Dr. Death to be his assistant for future birthday parties, and he agrees.</li><li> In <em>Ship of Ghouls</em>, when everyone's evacuating the bombed cruise ship, if you decide to swim hundreds of yards away to reach your best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">instead of getting into a lifeboat that's much closer</a>, he tells you to go away, because your added weight on the plank he's hanging onto would make both of you sink. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">He's not wrong, despite his selfishness</a>, though his choice to reject you causes you to drown.</li><li> <em>Deep in the Jungle of Doom</em> has an ending where your friend taunts you about being to scared to go into a cave before her, and when you do <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you hear her voice acting like she's feeding someone, and then the cave closes, because it's not a cave &mdash; it's a monster's mouth</span>.</li><li> Also, the majority of books have at least one bad ending which is caused by your "friend" even if it means ignoring continuity for it to work.</li><li> Your mom can (accidentally) kill you in <em>Please Don't Feed the Vampire!</em> when she pulls up the blinds in your room.</li><li> In <em>One Night in Payne House</em>, you can die when your friend lures you into falling to your death. He had been killed earlier in the story and you didn't realize that he was a ghost, so now he doesn't want to haunt the house alone.</li><li> Sometimes, <em>you</em> are the dreadful friend, which may lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">a bad ending</a> if other characters get sick of you. One example is <em>Scary Birthday To You!</em> where your friend is trapped in a ballroom with dancing ghosts because he wanted to learn the waltz from them. You decide that anyone who would actually <em>want</em> to learn the waltz is too boring to be worth saving; and escape on your own, leaving him to die.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>:<ul><li> <em>Revenge of the Body Squeezers</em> uses this trope in a mocking manner with the squeeze bomb scenario. You and a friend suspect the bomb is planted in a Rose Bowl float during New Year's Day. The two possible choices was a "Man on the Moon" float and a "Giant Clock" float. Regardless of the choice you make, neither float contains the bomb. However, in the story narrative, you insistently express that the former float has the bomb; with the logic that because aliens planted the bomb, the correct float <em>has</em> to be the one referencing outer space. If you act on that impulse, story "you" gloats about how your solid instincts won't betray you. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Nope</a>.<ul><li> With the "Giant Clock" choice, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>. Your friend thinks the aliens would plant a bomb on the float displaying how much time the bomb has to go off, but she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">only said that to throw you off track</a>, because she's working for the aliens. However, the book rewards your open mindedness for the "Giant Clock" float, since you later notice <em>another</em> float passing by, which has black gumballs that resemble squeeze bomb victims. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">That clue guides you to the bomb's real location</a>.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Scream of the Evil Genie</em>, you are stranded on an island when a parrot appears and you then have the choice of whether or not to follow it. If you figure that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateParrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateParrot">a parrot has to be bad news</a>, the book complains about your ingratitude and says that if you've read the series before, you should have known the parrot was trying to <em>help</em> you. You're allowed to continue only if you say this is your first <em>Give Yourself Goosebumps</em> book.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>: The author does a good job making you feel moronic for making some questionable choices. Sometimes, the book will give you another chance for making a sloppy decision, but others will automatically end the book there. Also done for readers who blatantly cheat, like bring more items than they should have (<em>One Night in Payne House</em> and <em>Zapped in Space</em>) or don't attempt to solve the otherwise simple mazes the way they were meant to, and instead only pick and choose the possible page number. Get it wrong, and something bad happens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">Your Head Asplode</a>: One of the bad endings in <em>Escape from Horror House</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>: A possible ending from <em>Escape from Camp Run-for-Your-Life</em>. Averted by <em>Zombie School</em> (since the "zombies" referenced in the title are living people who have just been brainwashed.)</li></ul></div><hr><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">Your life has been forever ruined by TV Tropes</a>.
