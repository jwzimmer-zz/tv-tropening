With the nuking of the Best Friends line, both dolls were retired, giving them the shortest availability for any Historical Character.</li><li> <strong>Kirsten Larson (1854):</strong> One of the original three, archived in 2010.

A video game is also released, hence the name "Mia Goes for Great".</li><li> <strong>Chrissa Maxwell, Sonali Matthews, and Gwen Thompson</strong> in 2009. Chrissa is the new girl who has to deal with bullying from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Mean Bees</a>. Sonali is a former member of the bees, and Gwen is the (literally) poor girl they used to harass. The first Girl of the Year to receive a movie.</li><li> <strong>Lanie Holland</strong> in 2010. An adventurous girl who loves the outdoors living with a family who prefers the indoors.</li><li> <strong>Kanani Akina</strong> in 2011. A Hawaiian girl who introduces her cousin to her homeland.

The second to have a Girl of the Year movie.</li><li> <strong>Saige Copeland</strong> in 2013.

Grace also got a movie, which tied in with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef">MasterChef</a> Junior</em>.</li><li> <strong>Lea Clark</strong> in 2016. A photographer who goes on a trip to Brazil to visit her older brother and shows interest in wildlife preservation. She was so far the final Girl of the Year to get a movie.</li><li> <strong>Gabriela McBride</strong> in 2017. An African-American spoken-word poet and dancer, whose mission is to save the Liberty Arts Center her mom directs from destruction. She also has a stutter, making her the second main American Girl and first Girl of the Year to have a canonically stated disability of any kind (McKenna's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">ADHD never breaks the subtext ceiling</a>). Gabriela was a return to longer availability windows for Girls of the Year, which had previously ended with Kailey; she was around until mid-2018 (and later Girls of the Year would last <em>three</em> years at a time), with a short return in a Costco bundle in late 2020.</li><li> <strong>Luciana Vega</strong> in 2018.

A surfer who, after a dare from her brother, tries out for the cheerleading team and discovers she can enjoy both sports.

(Fandom often refers to the lines as Historical and Modern.) The line focuses on modern girls and has purchasers choose from among a group of pre-designed unnamed dolls with accompanying clothing and accessories; this updates regularly to stay on top of modern day fashions and activities. In 2017, a line was introduced called "Create Your Own", where purchasers can mix and match features to design a doll to their exact specifications. Both of these lines&mdash;especially the multitude of options in the Create Your Own line&mdash;can lead to some uniquely designed characters.</p><p>Starting in 2016, American Girl released the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/WellieWishers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/WellieWishers">WellieWishers</a></em>, a line aimed at the previously-overlooked 5-7 year old demographic.</p><p>While the larger dolls are targeted towards the 8-12 year old age range, most of the fandom is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">over the age of eighteen</a>; this is due to many of the fans being people who either got dolls as children or wanted them and did not. (The dolls are relatively expensive and originally could only be mail-ordered. It wasn't until 2000 that there was an active website soon after Mattel's purchase or specialty stores; stores are still mostly found in very large American cities.)

The tribe's response is to call in Whipwoman to switch Kaya, but what makes it worse is that <em>all the other children</em> are punished, too. Whipwoman also shames Kaya publicly, saying a selfish magpie would take better care of Wing Feather and Sparrow than Kaya did. While this was acceptable for the time and community, it may make readers&mdash;and plenty of adults&mdash;cringe.

Felicity's family own two slaves&mdash;Rose and Marcus&mdash;and her grandfather owns a large plantation and thus, owns several slaves. Felicity almost never acknowledges the issues with owning people (she finds time on the plantation to be pleasant) and considers Rose and Marcus part of her family.

However, the plotlines and focus on class issues proved controversial; the first author, Susan S. Adler, was replaced for the third book which barely included Nellie and changed Edith from an antagonist to a minor acquaintance. Valerie Tripp wrote the last three books: Nellie is never mentioned by name in <em>Happy Birthday, Samantha</em> (leading to the fan theory that Grandmary, who was still slowly getting through her classism, didn't allow Samantha to invite her to her birthday party and made her invite Edith instead), and is entirely absent from <em>Samantha Saves The Day</em>, before coming back into the spotlight (at the center of a non-class-related plot arc) in <em>Changes for Samantha</em>.</li><li> At the release of Kaya's collection in 2002, Felicity and her collection was made available dominantly online, and she was no longer included in short story releases or compilations. She was partially restored with the release of her movie and best friend, but was retired yet again. Her third return gave her new-style books and a new meet outfit, but she is only available at the largest stores and online.</li><li> Samantha (round one), Felicity (twice), Kirsten, and Molly (twice) were all retired (or, as the company said, "archived") in various years, with their collections fully unavailable. Their books were initially available, but with the release of BeForever, any books in the older style were retired.</li><li> In the books, Molly's major best friends are Susan and Linda. In her collection, she was instead given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Emily</a> as her companion and Susan and Linda were never released as dolls.</li><li> With the releases of Melody, Nanea, and Courtney, Addy, Samantha, Kit, and Josefina have been demoted, as Felicity was before, to online-only and flagship store availability, with only the doll, meet accessories, and books available. Even when Felicity and Molly came back, they were given this treatment on arrival and ended up being archived once again for low sales (not a surprise, given that a doll with no collection is likely to shelfwarm).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment">Denied Food as Punishment</a>: In <em>Changes For Samantha</em>, Samantha's friend Nellie is regularly punished by the cold headmistress and given little to no food during her stay at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Coldrock House</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Didn't Think This Through</a>: In Lindsey's book, nearly all her problems come from the fact that she acts rashly when trying to solve a dilemma and doesn't think of the consequences, even when she's trying to be helpful. <em>Especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHelpingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHelpingMe">when she's trying to be helpful.</a><ul><li> When trying to protest the school's annual pet parade, where the students dress their pets in costumes, she takes Josh's lizard, runs up a tree with it, and refuses to come down.

Ana's arrival helps somewhat but Rebecca maintains the struggle to get her share of attention.</li><li> Averted with Molly for her first five books, but comes up in <em>Changes For Molly</em>, though it's less about relative ages and more about the fact that her father's letter describes the changes he expects to see in the other three, but seems to have tacked her on almost as an afterthought, mentioning her "in the same sentence as pot roast".</li><li> Kirsten is a middle child too, but doesn't display classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleChildSyndrome">Middle Child Syndrome</a> traits as much as Rebecca does.</li><li> Same goes for Addy. In her case, this may actually be because she is separated from her older brother and younger sister in <em>Meet Addy,</em> and effectively spends four of the six books in her series as an only child. Given the horrors the family is living through, it's hardly surprising that they'd develop a different kind of family dynamic and the kinds of issues that lead to Middle Child Syndrome would probably not seem all that serious by comparison.</li><li> Maryellen is a middle child (two older siblings and three younger) and her stories prominently feature her cry for attention.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>:<ul><li> Josefina's mom died a year prior to the first book, and her absense is felt in the family</li><li> Marie-Grace's mother has been dead for four years at the start of Marie-Grace's first book.</li><li> Samantha lost <em>both</em> her parents in a boating accident.</li><li> Courtney's stepsister Tina had her mother, Bonnie, die when she was six.</li><li> Inverted for Addy, as her mother is the only person in her family she's never separated from.

A notable example comes in with C&eacute;cile Rey (of the Historical line) and C&eacute;cile Revel (of the Girls of Many Lands line); they were released nine years apart and one was retired long before the other came out, minimizing any confusion. Then there's Samantha "Sam" Parkington and Sam Walker, Ruthie Smithens and Ruth Walker, Emily Bennett and Emily Holland, the Larson family from Kirsten's stories and Kit's neighbor Mrs. Larson, Sarah Moore and Sarah Barrett...<ul><li> Maryellen's stories averted it completely, having two Karens, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Skips</a>, and two minor characters called Betty.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome">Only Child Syndrome</a>: Strongly averted.

Addy deduces this in defending her name after being accused of theft and Elizabeth wanting to evict their family to hide her past, and part of her understands why the woman did it; the "Looking Back" section discusses this phenomenon and its aftereffects. Oddly enough, her actions to remove the Walkers are what out her as Black; despite the familial link, the Walker family had never met Elizabeth or knew her and probably never would have made the connection despite her becoming cold towards them. But when Elizabeth learned of their connection to Solomon and started to try and drive the family away &mdash; including accusing Addy of stealing a valuable necklace &mdash; Addy's determination to clear her own name led to the truth being revealed.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>:<ul><li> Annabelle assists Elizabeth and their mother in sewing Felicity's blue ballgown when Mrs. Merriman is too ill to do it herself.</li><li> In Kit's Christmas book, her grumpy Uncle Hendrick gets a small moment when he tells Kit to keep the money he was going to pay for a shoe shine after she did it herself (because the store was out of business), and allows her to earn more money in this fashion going forward. It's not exactly a massive expression of generosity (if he were truly generous, he'd help the family out more substantially and without expecting anything in return), but despite his miserly ways, he chooses to treat Kit in a way that he thinks of as fair to her (if she does the work, she gets paid for it) rather than take a clear opportunity to take advantage of a kid who probably won't even see it as such.

(which led to all the early characters having spring birthdays), '___ Saves the Day!' (summer adventure), and 'Changes for ___' (winter and some sort of closure to the story). The books broke the pattern with Kaya because Native Americans pre-contact obviously didn't have things like schoolhouses or Christmas, and all dolls released after her have followed a similarly loose formula (generally keeping the 'Meet ____' and 'Changes for ___' for the first and last book, with the four middle books being more flexible).

This is also seen with Julie's father bringing her a "new" tape recorder to use, and Courtney's books in the Looking Back section talking about how children of the 80's didn't have their own cellphones and social media to connect with each other so often met up at the mall to hang out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Teen Pregnancy</a>: Implied with Ana, Josefina's oldest sister.

About a third of the way through the story, she's caught sneaking out of her home with her maid to go see a play, and is punished by being sent to live with an elderly aunt in the country. Isabel is initially dismayed, believing that said aunt will be the latest in a line of adults trying to teach her to be a lady, but it turns out that her aunt is actually a strong, independent, educated woman&mdash;in other words, pretty much the exact kind of woman Isabel had always wished to become.

Though there's still only been one modern Kwanzaa set (back in the nineties), Julie's holiday book centered more on Chinese New Year than Christmas (but the collection has been Christmas stuff), Rebecca's on Hanukkah, and Kaya, as mentioned, has no holiday book but practises native spirituality.</li><li> This may have something to do with Melody's gold and cream outfit (which the books says she wears for New Year's Eve and Day "Watch Night" services) being advertised as a Christmas outfit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGoGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGoGirl">You Go, Girl!</a>: Julie's efforts to join the basketball team serve as a kid-friendly representation of second-wave feminism.
