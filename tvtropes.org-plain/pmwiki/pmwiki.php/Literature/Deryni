The first installment in the series was published in 1970, making it a relatively early example of modern fantasy, and one which is not modelled on Tolkien.</p><p>Most of the stories take place in Gwynedd (pronounced "<strong>GWI</strong>-neth"), intended to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">mirror</a> Britain, including clear fantasy counterparts to Scotland and Wales. In some ways, however, Gwynedd feels closer to Germany or Poland, since it is in central Europe, sharing a border with Torenth, a realm which is the counterpart of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Russia</a> with aspects of Hungary (such as the vineyards of Arjenol and Komn&eacute;n&euml;). Gwynedd and Torenth have a history of conflict that spans centuries.</p><p>The Deryni (pronounced "d&acirc;r-<strong>IN</strong>-ee" The word is both singular and plural, both noun and adjective.) are all empathic, and mildly telepathic. Sufficiently powerful Deryni can perform full mind control, telekinesis, and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RitualMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RitualMagic">Ritual Magic</a>. They can't teleport freely, but they can construct portals, and teleport from a portal to any other they know well - a fairly unusual restriction in fantasy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Extensive and/or repeated use of the powers in a short timeframe is also physically exhausting.</a> While the simpler psychic powers can be developed without special training, the ritual magic has to be formally taught. Since the Deryni have been persecuted for centuries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">they've forgotten much about their powers</a>, particularly the ritual magic and Healing. Though the Deryni are treated by the characters as a separate race, patterns of inheritance suggest they're more like redheads, and there is intermarriage between Deryni and ordinary humans. Deryni have never been as numerous as the ordinary humans with which they live, and the persecution has further reduced their numbers.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The church in Gwynedd, and many of the surrounding kingdoms, is very closely based on medieval Catholicism (minus a Pope equivalent), with liturgical services in Latin and using the real world's Bible. Torenth is depicted with an Eastern Orthodox style Christianity, complete with services in Greek, churches with icons, and metropolitans (as opposed to bishops) headed by a patriarch. Very rarely are other religions mentioned, although Judaism exists (a bishop refers to Jewish religious practices on one occasion), and a few minor characters are Muslims and pagans.</p><p>The majority of the protagonists are Deryni, and many of the villains are senior churchmen, but some of the Deryni are bishops, some of them are villains, and some of the bishops are good. The power struggles are largely political, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality">no side having a monopoly on virtue.</a> The overarching challenge of the books is that of building a just and stable social order for humans and Deryni despite their differences, their historical baggage and their capacity for evil.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The books were mostly published as a sequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trilogy">trilogies</a>. In publication order (dates in parentheses), they are:</p><p></p><ul><li> The Deryni Chronicles<ul><li> <em>Deryni Rising</em> (1970)</li><li> <em>Deryni Checkmate</em> (1972)</li><li> <em>High Deryni</em> (1973)</li></ul></li></ul><p>As this trilogy starts, the Deryni in Gwynedd have been persecuted by the church for two centuries, unfortunately for the new king, whose mother is Deryni <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism">(and suffers from internalized guilt and self-loathing because of this fact)</a>. Matters are further complicated by threats from a rival royal house of highly-trained Deryni from Torenth who use their arcane powers in an attempt to reconquer their neighbours.</p><p>The first trilogy includes some forms of magic (specifically summoning nasty creatures) which have never been seen since. This in a sense justified since persecution of Deryni is still ongoing in some areas and openly advocated by some highly-placed people, laymen and clergy. Also, it's Deryni villains past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> who do most of this sort of thing (Charissa in the coronation duel and Rhydon at the behest of Wencit of Torenth while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">torturing a captive</a>).</p><p></p><ul><li> The Legends of Camber<ul><li> <em>Camber of Culdi</em> (1976)</li><li> <em>Saint Camber</em> (1978)</li><li> <em>Camber the Heretic</em> (1981)</li></ul></li></ul><p>This was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> series set over two centuries before the first trilogy, providing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>.

Kelson also helps the heir to Torenth (another 14 year old boy) defeat an attempted <em>coup d'etat</em> and releases him from his oath of fealty, forging a new alliance of equals after centuries of rivalry. The victory is not complete however, for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> Teymuraz escapes</span>. Kelson and his courtiers also continue the work of reestablishing Deryni heritage; Duncan consecrates a chapel dedicated to Saint Camber using magic with an archbishop at each elbow, and Kelson enlists assistance in founding a school for training Deryni to use their powers.<p></p></li><li> The Childe Morgan trilogy<ul><li> <em>In the King's Service</em> (2003)</li><li> <em>Childe Morgan</em> (2006)</li><li> <em>The King's Deryni</em> (2014)</li></ul></li></ul><p>This trilogy begins about three decades before <em>Deryni Rising</em>.

While Kelson personally fights an arcane duel against Charissa to resolve the issue, Alaric asks Duncan to help him Heal himself. It's only the second time Morgan has ever done it, and he's lost some blood, while Duncan has never even tried to Heal before and doesn't know if he can do it at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeFamily">Alliterative Family</a>: In <em>King Kelson's Bride</em>, Savile Saint-Pol, Baron Kishknock, is married to Princess Sivorn (sister of L&eacute;tald, Hort of Orsal, and widow of Prince Richard Haldane, Duke of Carthmoor) and their children: Savilla, Sivney, Siany, and Sorley. This must be something between the couple, for Sivorn's daughters by Prince Richard are named Richelle and Araxie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>: As a series of books set in countries run by monarchies in a feudalistic society, this recurs frequently. Among the many examples:<ul><li> The last independent Prince of Meara negotiated a marriage between his eldest daughter and the Haldane king of Gwynedd, in hopes that his principality would be protected from rivals. Others among his nobility (including his wife) valued Meara's independence more than any hoped-for security, and decades of intermittent rebellion followed. Kelson attempted to solve this problem by his "marrying Meara" with disastrous results; he later arranged two other marriages with descendants of the old Mearan royal line with better success.</li><li> Kelson is also said to have arranged a pair of marriages between members of his family and those of the Torenthi royal family. The <em>Codex</em> notes that Liam-Lajos and his sister marry a couple of Kelson's near relatives. This seems to be part of his long-term plan to resolve the long-standing conflict between Gwynedd and Torenth.</li><li> King Donal Haldane himself twice married princesses from neighbouring kingdoms, and he arranged the marriage of Alyce de Corwyn with Kenneth Morgan. Kenneth was loyal to Donal and "a safe pair of hands" to protect the wealthy and strategically-placed Duchy of Corwyn. Alyce herself knew and understood the king would decide her choice of husband, especially after deaths in the ducal family line left her the only heir. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">the marriage did become a love match</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed">Altar the Speed</a>: Duncan McLain and Maryse MacArdry fell in love in April 1107 and planned to ask thier parents' permission to marry at the end of the summer. A McLain man killed Maryse's eldest brother, and the clan chiefs decided to separate their clans to avoid a full-on blood feud. The night before Caulay MacArdry was to leave Culdi, Duncan and Maryse secretly wed in the castle's chapel, then consummated their union in the stable loft.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">Ambadassador</a>: Alaric Morgan is one of these offscreen as <em>Deryni Rising</em> begins: The reason he's absent from that ill-fated hunting trip is that Wencit of Torenth has been trying to annex Cardosa, a key Gwyneddian city that guards a major pass through the Rheljan Mountains between Torenth and Gwynedd. King Brion tells his son Kelson that Wencit has already broken two treaties in his efforts to get the city, and "Morgan is keeping an eye on it." After Kelson summons Morgan back to the capital <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because of Brion's last order</span>, Wencit takes advantage of his absence and the valley's uneven run-off patterns to take Cardosa before Kelson can send relief forces, and he's in residence there early in <em>High Deryni</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">And Now You Must Marry Me</a>: Sometimes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> has <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

In ordinary humans, it only produces a mild drowsiness. In earlier times, Deryni were exposed to it as part of their training; after the persecutions began, knowledge of it, like so much else, became fragmented and contradictory.

(This may be one reason why Morgan didn't heal the exhausted McLain page boy before all those Christian clerics in <em>High Deryni</em>; he may have expected the clerics would get wrapped up in a debate after witnessing him perform a miracle and forget all about Wencit's impending invasion.) How does that undercut the rationale (such as it is) for persecuting Deryni? Was Christ Deryni?</li><li> Was Camber really a saint? Perhaps a guardian angel?

Also, the linked monarchies of Howicce and Llanedd have separate laws and customs (particularly regarding inheritance) akin to those of Aragon and Castile in the real world.

They are frequently denigrated as "rogue half-breeds", and despite showing great promise as mages (including manifesting a Healing talent lost for centuries), they are extended official Counciliar protection only after much acrimonious debate in <em>High Deryni</em>.

After Nigel is reconciled to his granddaughter (Conall's illegitimate daughter Conalline Amelia), the two go into Meraude's private apartments, and Jehana describes them thus: "They looked like a pair of newlyweds."

He rises to Auxilary Bishop of Rhemuth (the secular capital) and later to the See of Dhassa (third-ranked in precedence in the kingdom) as well as serving as an advisor to King Brion and King Kelson. He works secretly to find and ordain more Deryni priests, and he takes a secondary role to Cardiel's in the schism over the Corwyn Interdict in 1121. He's a also a member of the Camberian Council, which entails keeping yet more secrets. Though he has a more confident framing of his penchant for secrecy when confronted by Cardiel, he finds it harder to face another Deryni: "I did what I dared, Duncan. I would that it had been more....I dared not jeopardize what greater good I might achieve by acting prematurely. You can understand that, can't you?"</li><li> Mixed Type 1 &amp; 3: Bishop (later Archbishop) Thomas Cardiel is a charismatic leader with an honest curiosity and a scrupulous conscience that will not let him condemn Deryni out of hand. He rises within the ranks to be the (traditionally neutral) Bishop of Dhassa, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenPrincipledStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenPrincipledStand">takes a stand on conscience by leading a schism over the Corwyn Interdict</a>. As a result, he becomes Archbishop of Rhemuth (second only to the Primate, the Archbishop of Valoret), and he goes back to working within the system. After Duncan outs himself, Cardiel orders him to disappear for a while; when Duncan asks "For how long?" Cardiel replies, "Until I can get the bloody law changed, goddammit, man!"</li><li> Type 3: Monsignor (later Bishop) Duncan McLain is first introduced as King's Confessor, and he later rises to Auxiliary Bishop of Rhemuth under Cardiel. The Laws of Ramos force him to begin his career in secrecy, but events help blow his cover. His relationship to his infamous cousin Morgan and his own ducal inheritance push him into the limelight, and he eventually embraces the Icon role to live as an open example of an upright Deryni priest. As he tells Arilan: "And just how long was I supposed to have waited? Twenty-odd years, like you? Is that how long you've been a priest? And you <em>still</em> haven't owned up to what you are! <em>Someone's</em> got to be first, if there's ever going to be a change."</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd>Both sides of the debate have a point. Time and experience are both needed to overcome the fear and stigma that have been promulgated as holy truth and enshrined in law for generations, and it's far easier to get to know people as people if the Deryni powers don't come up. Yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld">the ultimate goal is to live openly as Deryni</a>, and for that to happen, the secrecy must be abandoned. This seems to be underlined in <em>King Kelson's Bride</em>; during the consecration of the Saint Camber chapel when Duncan extends his aura over the altar to consecrate it, Cardiel is at his elbow and Arilan is in the back, wearing the plain black working cassock of a simple priest.</dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheEndYouAreOnYourOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheEndYouAreOnYourOwn">In the End, You Are on Your Own</a>: Whatever assistance Kelson and Liam get from their friends, at some point, they each find they must cope with some things by themselves:<ul><li> In one step of his empowerment ritual, Kelson has to pierce his own hand with the clasp of a large Haldane brooch.

The bishop arrogantly points out the horse is his property, suggests he's motivated by a desire to feed the poor, and refuses all offers to purchase the horse. While de Nore nurtures a particular grudge aginst Alaric due to the role the boy's mother played in the conviction and execution of his brother, he is also well-known for persecuting Deryni generally.

Some of the younger people even act on their different notions of the proper and the just. In particular:<ul><li> <em>Deryni Checkmate</em>: During the meeting of the Curia on the Corwyn Interdict, Archbishop Corrigan (then Archbishop of Rhemuth and Loris's ally) reacted to the defiance of the younger Cardiel and his allies by "[throwing] up his hands in dismay and asking if they are 'now to be schooled by [their] juniors'".</li><li> <em>High Deryni</em>: In a meeting of the Camberian Council, its youngest member Tiercel de Claron mounts an eloquent defence of Morgan and Duncan when two other members deride them for being half-breeds. Tiercel starts with the proposition that they should be sought out "on bended knee, begging them to share their great knowledge with us" (referring to the pair's rumoured rediscovery of Healing, a talent lost for some two centuries). He goes on to suggest, based on what they know of the powers, that being Deryni may be an all-or-nothing proposition like other traits.

A few examples:<ul><li> In their second effort to slip into Dhassa, Morgan and Duncan question a number of fellow travelers and erase their memories before releasing them. They also question a group of children who try to steal their horses, leaving them with false memories to explain their possession of the animals (which they must leave behind to take the path one boy described).</li><li> The clergy assigned to Rhemuth's Cathedral of Saint George and Saint Hilary's Basilica (including Brother Jerome, the sacristan and Duncan's chaplain Father Shandon) are regular victims of this trope in several books. A Transfer Portal is located in the cathedral sacristy, and another is in Duncan's study at the basilica; inconvenient clerics often must to be dealt with to maintain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> and allow Deryni to secretly use them.

Imre and Ariella display their auras to underline their power; Kelson and his closest courtiers only gradually come to do so, and only in certain formal settings. Some of the worst villains are Deryni, in part because the powers, especially those involving mind control, offer so many opportunities for cruelty that are unavailable to ordinary humans.

Rhys Michael Haldane pressed an enameled brooch into service for a self-designed triggering of his powers; this piece was used later in the timeline for the more structured rituals of his successors. Donal Haldane used a silver bracelet to encode his son's ritual; Alyce de Corwyn Morgan triggered part of the process on her deathbed, and her son Alaric finished it years later. Later still, Kelson's ritual used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOfPower">Ring of Fire</a> in addition to the Eye of Rom and the Haldane Lion Brooch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">The Magocracy</a>: The Festillic Interregnum was characterized by Deryni nobility dividing the spoils of conquest; lands and titles were redistributed among Festil's followers, giving mages effective control of the government.

Hostile clerics and other humans don't like to see a wealthy and beautiful "sorceress" wed and reproduce; High Deryni Lords and Ladies who worry about protecting their heritage against hostile forces would prefer she wed another mage instead of a mere human, who will only father "inferior half-breeds".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>: Played with extensively throughout. Once the anti-Deryni backlash begins, many Deryni go underground. Camber's son-in-law accidentally discovers he can block Deryni powers, and after some testing, a baptism cult is set up to turn off the powers of many Deryni so that they can go into hiding (this cult goes on for two or three years as depicted in <em>King Javan's Year and The Bastard Prince</em>). After a couple of centuries, the dispute over when and how to open the closet door turns on the question, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">"Is the world ready yet?"</a> (Given the long and recent history of persecution, the answer may be "No.") The demands of exigent circumstances (particularly the need for Deryni clerics to conceal their magical activities) lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">human witnesses having their memories altered</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">often without their knowledge or consent.</a><ul><li> On the other hand some humans taken into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> are completely comfortable with having their memories altered.

He and Morgan get into an argument and Arilan finally reveals to the cousins he is also Deryni. He offers Morgan the chance to read his mind (which Morgan accepts) in an effort to make peace.</li><li> In <em>The King's Justice</em>, Arilan finds Jehana guilt-stricken after she warned Nigel of an assassination plot, knowledge she acquired thanks to her powers. First he tries to teach her through a couple of parables that she had an affirmative duty to reveal what she had learned, and when she retorts that he doesn't understand, he displays his Deryni aura to show her that he actually does.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a>: Some of Camber's twelfth-century appearances are accounted for by a living person. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Some aren't</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">May&#150;December Romance</a>: Jehana, Dowager Queen of Gwynedd, and her second husband Lord Barrett de Laney are some three decades apart in age.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulFuneral">Meaningful Funeral</a>: A selection:<ul><li> in <em>In the King's Service</em>, Marie de Corwyn is decked out as if for her wedding (including a floral wreath) because she died a virgin. Her brother Ahern's funeral reflects his status as heir to Corwyn (not its duke) because the anti-Deryni laws prohibit Deryni from succeeding to their titles until they're twenty-five (a full eleven years later than ordinary humans).</li><li> In <em>Childe Morgan</em>, the new King Brion Haldane recoils when he sees clerics kneeling in prayer around his father's bier and demands to know why they're there. He's told the Archbishops ordered it as a mark of respect. It's possible Brion recalled how Donal was flogged by order of the Church for executing a priest who was an accomplice to the rape and murder of a small boy.</li><li> Alaric Morgan's beloved sister Bronwyn and her fianc&eacute; (Duncan's elder half-brother Kevin McLain, Earl of Kierney) have a joint funeral in <em>Deryni Checkmate</em>. Duncan celebrates the funeral Mass at his father's request despite his suspension from the priesthood. Like her aunt before her, Bronwyn is bedecked as if for her wedding, which had been planned to take place that same day.</li><li> In discussing arrangements for Lady Vivienne de Jordanet's funeral in <em>King Kelson's Bride</em>, her fellow councillor Barrett recalls how another of their number was carried to his grave:</li></ul><div class="indent"> Six vowed Knights of the Anvil carried him to his rest, Azim, all of them arrayed in the full panoply of your Order&#151;and none of them laid a hand on the coffin.

The Camber trilogy and the short stories "Catalyst" and "Healer's Song" cover a period when Healers were relatively numerous and had well-established training schools, complete with characteristic garb ("Healer's green" clothing) and schools with differing approaches to the Healing trance. Fast forward two hundred years, and the talent is so rare only four people are known to have it (as of <em>King Kelson's Bride</em>), so all bets are off. Alaric Morgan rediscovers the talent first, and he's definitely a combatant. His cousin Duncan is a cleric, but he's also known to fight when circumstances demand it (first when atttacked, later to save Morgan's life after an ambush, later still as a combat leader commanded by his king in time of civil war). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His son</span> Dhugal is also a combat leader, but he has more typical training as a battle medic, in part because his clan isn't very wealthy. Warin de Grey is also a combat leader, heading a rebellion against Morgan in particular, Deryni in general, and King Kelson by extension. It could also be argued that the novels are set in a feudal society which lacks modern population numbers and niceties like well-developed laws of war; certainly some things are beyond the pale, but fighters with medical skills is a comparatively minor detail.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">Medieval European Fantasy</a>: The books are set in a world with feudal social structures in most known countries, and the technology is on par with that of the real world's Western Europe in that period.

Also, the terms of the duel will keep all of them there in the circle until all of one side are dead. Wencit himself asks for death.

Gorony was an enthusiastic inquisitor, and Kelson likens reading Gorony's mind to "taking a swim in the castle middens in the summertime." When it's Loris' turn, Kelson finds reading Loris "even more loathsome than reading Gorony had been"; Loris gave explicit instructions to Istelyn's executioners and revelled in their grisly work, and he engaged in inquisitions and burnings in many outlying areas of the kingdom prompted by his "long-standing and unreasoning hatred of the Deryni."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>: Wencit of Torenth uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">a combination of mundane and psychic/magical techniques</a> against Sean of Derry in <em>High Deryni</em>, in the process also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">casting a powerful spell to control Derry's mind</a>.

Jehana objects, then casts a vote against him since Kelson is presiding in person. Once Kelson hears the clock chime the hour and knows he's turned fourteen, he asserts "I rule today!" and appoints Morgan's aide Sean Earl Derry to the vacant seat (one of the members was killed in an ambush days earlier); this forces a tie vote and Kelson breaks the tie, freeing Morgan and insisting that any resubmission of the charges will require further proof. Jehana is not happy to be defeated by a suddenly-grown son: "Kelson had stood before the Council and defied her&#151;not with childish threats and impotent taunts, but with decisive, adult action...now that Kelson was King in fact as well as in name&#151;a development she hadn't even considered before&#151;how could she possibly lure him away from Morgan's evil influence?"</li><li> When Istelyn delivers Loris's notice of Kelson's excommunication and Interdict for Gwynedd to the king at Dol Shaia, Kelson reads it and loses his temper.

(Arilan is not only the first ordained Deryni in Gwynedd in two centuries, he is also a member of the secretive Camberian Council.) Arilan shares what he can with Cardiel so they can both lead their side of the schism against Archbishop Loris (which is over Deryni in general and certain ones in particular). Together, they help reconcile the Church with King Kelson before the coming Torenthi invasion.</li><li> In <em>King Kelson's Bride</em>, Liam and M&aacute;ty&aacute;s escort Kelson, Morgan and Dhugal to visit the Nikolaseum, a great memorial tomb for a Torenthi prince who saved the life of his king in battle against the forces of Gwynedd a century earlier. There, Liam and M&aacute;ty&aacute;s ask for Kelson's help to foil a plot against Liam. In deciding what to do, Kelson says, "<em>Someone</em> must trust, if we are ever to end what brought Nikola to his death." In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBeam">mental conference with Morgan and Dhugal</a>, Kelson asks if he should trust them, and Morgan replies, "<em>As you say, my prince, someone must trust.</em>" M&aacute;ty&aacute;s offers the location and pattern of a Transfer Portal nearby, and Kelson and Morgan allow Liam to bring them to one of M&aacute;ty&aacute;s' private chapels via Portal (with Liam in control, since he knows their destination) to confer in detail.

In <em>High Deryni</em>, Morgan tries to contact Derry mentally (sending a Call) during the reconciliation service for himself and Duncan and faints from the effort; Duncan makes the excuse that his cousin isn't used to fasting.

His son Brion is attacked shortly after his ascension in <em>Childe Morgan</em>, and years later he is murdered by a Festilic pretender to his throne. His grandson Kelson is also targeted a week or two later when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the same Pretender, Charissa Duchess of Tol&aacute;n,</span> sends a poisonous creature to attack him in a garden and personally challenges him at his coronation ceremony.</li><li> In Torenth, Wencit of Torenth comes to the Torenthi throne by disposing of his nephew.

This resets the clock on the power of the Torenthi regents, the boys' uncles, since Liam-Lajos is under age at the time. It is later revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> two of those uncles actually murdered Alroy to extend their power</span>. Later, there is some inkling that the assassins sent to kill Nigel while Kelson was away fighting rebels were also tasked with killing Liam-Lajos while they were at it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivilegedRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivilegedRival">Privileged Rival</a>: <em>Deryni Rising</em> has Kelson (young, inexperienced, labouring under a religious and social system that persecutes Deryni) facing Charissa, who's about a decade older, highly trained in arcana, wealthy and related to the royal family of the neighbouring kingdom that has no such history of persecution.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>: Morgan wears a stiletto up his sleeve and chain mail under his clothes, even at his own ducal state dinners (in his own castle!).

The next morning, Rogier is found stabbed to death by Brion's ransacked tomb, "with his own hand on the dagger and a terrible expression on his face, as though he fought whatever it was that made him do it," as Nigel puts it.</li><li> Minions sent by Deryni often have death-triggers or death-compulsions implanted in their minds. To give only one example, the assassins who attacked Kelson and Liam outside the Hort of Orsal's palace both had these, as well as mind-wipes to prevent anyone from reading their memories after they died.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: a full range of telepathy from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">an empathic sensing of emotions</a> through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">Truth Reading</a> through compelling targets to speak the truth (Truth Saying) and all the way up to total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>.

The more skilled a Deryni is, the more control s/he has over the adjustment. Since Deryni are also empathic, the shields are quite necessary to protect them from the strong emotions of others as well as keeping their own thoughts and feelings private. Shields can be affected by head injuries or drugs like <em>merasha</em>, and they rapidly degrade when a Deryni dies. A few people thought to be human (Sean Lord Derry and Sir Kenneth Morgan, Earl of Lendour <em>de jure uxoris</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1d9je');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1d9je" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1d9je');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in right of his wife</span> among them) are found to have rudimentary shields.

Morgan has a bigger role in the events of the <em>Chronicles of the Deryni</em> trilogy, but Kelson comes more to the fore in the next trilogy (called <em>The Histories of King Kelson</em>). It's justified in that Kelson is introduced as a boy of fourteen at the start of the <em>Chronicles</em>, and that entire trilogy takes place within the following year, so he lacks age and experience. The <em>Histories</em> take place a few years later, after Kelson has grown a bit and been on the throne for a while, and the third volume centers around Kelson's knightly accolade and the coming of age that represents. Morgan is still alive and well as a friend and advisor (the <em>Codex</em> lists him as such several years after the events of <em>King Kelson's Bride</em>), but his presence isn't as large as in the earlier works.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler">Reluctant Ruler</a>:<ul><li> King Cinhil Haldane was happy as a cloistered priest, and he came to resent Camber for his misery after he was persuaded to accept a dispensation from his vows, together with a wife and a crown.</li><li> Centuries later, Prince Regent Nigel Haldane is this in prospect; he prepares for his empowering ritual with a heavy heart because he doesn't want to confront the possibility he'll become king, and later on he insists on postponing his coronation for a year when his nephew is reported missing.</li><li> Liam-Lajos and Kelson have this exchange (together with Nigel), while Liam holds the jewelled circlet his uncle M&aacute;ty&aacute;s brought for him:</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Liam:</strong> I don't want this.

In particular, Denis Arilan and Duncan McLain have to resolve a basic personal conflict (between their arcane abilities and their vocations) which is tied to church politics and a later schism; they both choose to be priests, but Denis keeps his secret as far as possible, while Duncan eventually lives openly as a Deryni priest. Alaric Morgan has spent years cultivating an ominous reputation, yet he has to adjust when a new king (Kelson, himself half Deryni) takes the throne and works to end the persecutions and regain lost knowledge. Kelson has to grow into his own as a man and a king, cope with his heritage on a personal level and cope with rebellions, church schism, and the rival kingdom to the east.

Cardiel argued that it was unjust to punish the people of Corwyn for the actions of its duke and left open the possibility that Morgan and Duncan were morally innocent. The conflict escalated as other bishops, including Arilan and Tolliver (Corwyn's bishop) joined in, accusing Loris of supporting a rebellion against the king and promoting genocide against the Deryni.

King Kelson Haldane in particular holds that his arcane powers (which he distinguishes from those of Deryni in general) are a manifestation of divine favour, signifying his right to rule. He says as much during an archiepiscopal tribunal investigating Duncan McLain's marriage:<div class="indent"> "Deryni are not the only ones to have this power, Bishop Arilan....We Haldanes can tell when a man is lying.

Some highly skilled Deryni can disguise their shields, making them seem transparent. Ordinary humans lack these shields, so their surface thoughts are easily apparent to Deryni. Transfer Portals have a residual signature that Deryni can feel and recognize (described as a tingling sensation coming from the area of the floor/ground where the Portal is located). Other objects and places associated with arcane rituals take on psychic energies over time, and Deryni can feel these power traces as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a>: Both the ability to manifest Deryni powers and the Haldane potential (apparently a variant) are transmitted genetically; the trait is dominant, so only one parent needs to have the trait for an offspring to inherit it. Thus, so-called "half-breeds" are just as powerful as full-blooded Deryni. Deryni generally need to be taught to use their powers; carriers of the Haldane potential need no training, but must have the potential triggered by a outside action. This is usually done in a ritual, the specifics of which vary slightly from one generation to the next; certain heirloom objects are used, and new ones may be added.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolMotifClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolMotifClothing">Symbol Motif Clothing</a>: Kelson Haldane has in his wardrobe a tunic of red covered with tiny golden Haldane lions.
