John Marcone, crime lord and Accorded Baron of Chicago, has been kidnapped by forces unknown, and Mab wants him freed.

Wanting to take away that impressive title, Harry calls them "Nickleheads."</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Eldest Gruff</span> asks Harry what he thinks is going through Mab's head regarding her actions during the book (such as wanting to save Marcone), Harry replies he has a hard enough time with mortal women. It would take a wiser man than him to understand a <em>fae</em> woman. After a minute, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Eldest Gruff erupts with a baying laugh</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: Harry meets one of the strongest <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of the Archangels</span> in the form of a janitor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">Always a Bigger Fish</a>: Harry is running like hell to get away from Magog <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and off the island.

Michael is used to the idea that <em>he</em> as a Knight would bear and suffer burdens so others do not. However, Harry lies by omission to the White Council in order to gain their support against the Denarians, just to give Michael and Sanya an edge against these ancient enemies, knowing that Michael would never and could never lie to get help. According to Sanya, Michael considers the fact that Harry would risk his life&mdash;as, if the Council found out he lied, it could be called treason&mdash;for Michael's principles and goal a messianic act.</li><li> Later, Harry references this side of himself again when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he has incapacitated Nicodemus by strangling him with the Judas Noose</span>. A man like Michael would have stopped, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nicodemus couldn't fight back. Harry just keeps going.

Even if they have a job at the moment that doesn't involve the other, odds are they will end up getting into a tussle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is used by Harry when he lures some of the hobs assaulting Grand Central Terminal to attack Tiny Gruff.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Archmage</a>:<ul><li> The Archive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Using only the magic she could draw in before all magic was cut off at the Shedd Aquarium, she holds her own against half a dozen Denarians effortlessly. Harry watches her use two different spells at the same time in each hand. If not for the limits of her child-size body, she would have outlasted all of them and left more dead on the floor.</span></li><li> Tessa is the mastermind behind constructing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the greater circle which binds the Archive, tapping into the power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine">Ley Line</a>.

According to Nicodemus, he is the one teaching magic in Tessa's team, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is in the Black Council</span>, and he is (or was) an expert in the use of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> soulfire</span>.</li><li> The Eldest Gruff. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite standing only five feet tall, this ancient powerful fae holds three purple stoles he claimed after defeating three different Senior Council members in what was most probably duels to the death.

Considering what is inside, Harry wants the ones he took from dead Dearians in a contained space. He worries there could be some effect of the Fallen to ensure Murphy's luck hits and the coin "just happens" to land on open skin or roll away from capture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseReligion">Artistic License &#150; Religion</a>: Uriel is said in this book to have killed the first-born of Egypt. However, the Bible explicitly notes that God <em>personally</em> did that, not an angel (though it's possible that Bob was misinformed, since this was well before his time).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>: Sanya admitted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathMasks">in his debut</a> that despite being a Knight of the Cross, he was once a Denarian. He finally gives the whole story in this book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">An Axe to Grind</a>: Gard is seen with one early on.

He loses half an ear in the process.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucifer</span> twice gives his agents Super Hellfire in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bind the Archive. Because of this fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel">Archangel Uriel</a> is able to endow someone on the side of good with a greater power.

By tossing her coin at Harry Dresden and Harry Carpenter a few years back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathMasks">Death Masks</a></em>, he planned on one of them becoming infected with Lasciel. Either little Hank would grow up having Lasciel whispering in his ear and turning him into his parents' worst nightmare, or Nicodemus would gain a powerful Wizard in his ranks. The only thing he failed to take into account was just how thick and stubborn Harry Dresden was when he grabbed the coin to save Little Harry, since as far as both the Denarians and the Church know, no one has ever resisted a Fallen's Shadow before. Michael implies that this wasn't the first time Nicodemus made such plans.</li><li> Titania has played one since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProvenGuilty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProvenGuilty">Proven Guilty</a>.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That silver oak leaf that grants Harry a boon from Summer was something she knew he would keep on him, in the event that he needed it in the war, and which is valuable enough to not waste frivolously. So it would provide her and her people an ideal tracking method when Mab eventually comes to Harry with another favor to ask of him. Even with the strongest blizzard going around Harry, the leaf's signal still gets through.</span></li><li> Harry runs one himself. Knowing what sort of man Nicodemus is, Harry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gives Luccio some of his hair to allow her to track him in one of Marcone's helicopters for a rescue mission when the deal goes south. He also brings the silver oak leaf to draw Summer into the fray. And then set up a second escape route with Thomas on the <em>Water Beetle</em>.</span></li><li> Nicodemus again, asking Harry for a private talk in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he indirectly reveals their plan to kidnap Ivy, knowing that Harry's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> tendencies would nake him lash out first, allowing Nic to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a> since he never said anything concrete while pinning the blame of breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a> on Harry who has a history of doing so</span>.</li><li> Tessa and co. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after failing to catch Ivy, decide to capture Kincaid and Harry, the only people who love Ivy as a person and vice-versa. It works, much to the guilt of the pair</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">Batman Grabs a Gun</a>: Harry's strange behavior, in particular <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lacking his blasting rod and barely using any fire magic</span>, makes <em>Luccio</em> grab it by permitting Molly to enter Harry's mind and see if his thoughts have been tampered with, knowing she is fully guilty of breaking the Fourth Law of Magic (using mind magic to bend or break a person's will to hers). While technically speaking, a passive observation of Harry's thoughts isn't breaking the Fourth Law, in much the same way that walking into a bank vault and just <em>looking</em> at the money isn't bank robbing, the Council still frowns on these "grey areas," and for a high-ranking Warden to give it the go-ahead is a difficult decision.
