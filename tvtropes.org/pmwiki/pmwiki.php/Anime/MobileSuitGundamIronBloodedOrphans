While they were all built around the same high-performance inner frame, the difference in appearance between the Kimaris and Barbatos (the two suits closest to their original designs) indicates that their seventy-two elite pilots were given considerable freedom to customize their machines.<ul><li> We get to see this unfold with the course of the Barbatos' modifications. It goes from being a half-salvaged mess (Forms 1-3), to how its pilot preferred during the Calamity War (Form 4), to being built more to Mikazuki's preferences (Form 6), culminating in the Barbatos Lupus in Season 2, which is truly Mikazuki's machine.</li></ul></li><li> Via a series of extensive (and messy) modifications, Crank's standard-model Graze eventually gets turned into Norba's Ryusei-Go, a lethal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> with a fancy paintjob, an Alaya-Vijnana system, and a whole lot of Teiwaz technology under the hood.</li><li> The Gusion piloted by a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirate</a> turned out to be a <em>heavily</em> modified Gundam Frame, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">very bulky and thick armor</a>. Tekkadan recover it and tear everything down to the frame and rework it into the Gusion Rebake, which barely resembles the suit that it used to be.</li><li> The Schwalbe Graze is a modified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> for Gjallarhorn officers who can handle its high mobility and tricky control scheme to its fullest.</li><li> The Graze Ritter is a sister unit designed for both ceremonial purpose and orbital combat, they are geared with swords for its swift moment under gravity.</li><li> And then there is Graze Ein, which is a case of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine">the pilot himself</a></em> becoming <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a>.</span></li><li> Julietta got her Reginlaze Julia as her mid-season upgrade, which is a prototype high mobility suit based on the Reginlaze.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>: Downplayed by the series as a whole. Although some pilots are highly skilled, even the best pilot around in the most advanced mobile suit available usually isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> (in contrast to other Gundam shows, where ace pilots can slaughter mooks by the cartload). That said...<ul><li> Mikazuki is hands-down the best pilot in Tekkadan, defeating every opponent he has faced with a minimum of fuss, even when he is severely outnumbered, facing a much more experienced enemy, fighting against another Gundam, or some combination thereof. This is largely due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface">Alaya-Vijnana system</a>. Even a single implant allows its user to control their mobile suit with exceptional skill compared to a conventional pilot &mdash; and Mika has <em>three</em> implants, with the Barbatos tuned to use the extra "bandwidth" to its fullest.</li><li> Resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> McGillis is the other main example. He manages to keep up with Mikazuki and the Barbatos despite lacking both an Alaya-Vijnana implant and a Gundam of his own. Even Mika, who generally doesn't care about anything in combat except the fight right in front of him at the time, is impressed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's also one of only two characters to defeat a Gundam with a single-reactor suit in a straight duel, and once he finally gets an Alaya-Vijnana implant, he becomes a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> - though admittedly one whose spectacular combat performance is often a result of his enemies putting up less of a fight in order to lure him into traps.</span></li><li> Amida Arca, head wife of Naze Turbine, 100% natural human and main pilot/resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> of the Turbines.

They're powerful enough to be banned by international convention, and while they're unwieldy and slow-firing on their own, any army that can put together the ludicrous amount of resources required to deploy them en masse is functionally invincible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Arianrhod Fleet arms themselves with them in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> moment in Season 2, and from there onwards, it's all downhill for our heroes.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a>: Kudelia is subjected to a lot of ogling by the camera for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> purposes; and if you're uneasy about her actual age, not to worry: the Turbines bring <em>even more.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a>: Several characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as Crank, Masahiro and Aston</span> who seemed important during their introduction are eventually killed off a few episodes later.

Few characters get a chance to be properly identified with a particular mobile suit, so it becomes more a matter of finding which mobile suit they prefer and sticking with it. The Gundam pilots themselves tend to stick with their Gundam, with minor modifications made along the way rather than big overhauls. Gundam Barbatos has no fewer than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">four minor armor and weapon packages</a> throughout the first season, when it is upgraded to Barbatos Lupus, Nadi starts calling it the Lupus but Mikazuki assures him it is still Barbatos.<ul><li> Because mobile suit combat focuses on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit">Sniping the Cockpit</a>, this leaves what is left of the mobile suit salvageable. Episode 17 has the characters win out against a group of pirates and claim their gear, with the sole exception of Mikazuki most of the named characters switch to better gear, including one surprise Gundam which they refurbish into the Gusion Rebake.</li><li> The second season opens with Gundam Barbatos and Gusion Rebake getting a general overhaul by Teiwaz and are renamed the Barbatos Lupus and Gusion Rebake Full City <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later, Barbatos Lupus Rex</span>.

They produce "Ahab waves" that (as is typical for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>) act as a wide-spectrum jammer, making long-range targeting impractical and necessitating the close-range combat that mobile suit specialize in, while also being involved with battle strategies. There is a general ban of mobile suits within any city, as it tends to shut down conventional power supplies. The Ahab waves themselves can be detected, however, and each reactor has a unique signature, meaning that different reactors (and thus different mobile suits and ships) can be identified at a distance by their Ahab waves alone. Ahab reactors have several other properties as well: they're able to generate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a>, and the enable to use of nanolaminate armour.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">Moral Myopia</a>: Brought up in the second episode when Ein calls Mika a coward for attacking their mobile workers. Mika promptly points out that Gjallarhorn's mobile suits had been attacking CGS's mobile workers until Mika stopped them.<ul><li> Gjallarhorn seems to succumb to this in general. Later episodes have other members of Gjallarhorn (and Ein again) furious at Tekkadan for actions they themselves committed previously, such as Carta becoming angry at them for lacking manners while still trying to murder them all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> may have something to do with this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>: When the &#256;laya-Vij&ntilde;&#257;na spinal cybernetics implants are introduced, we see a flashback of Orga getting his in a rather painful process. Another character notes that the soldiers performing the procedure beat the crap out of him for having the cheek to not cry out in pain while it was being inserted. Orga just says that if he <em>had</em> made any noise, they would've beaten him for being a crybaby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionCaptureMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionCaptureMecha">Motion Capture Mecha</a>: The &#256;laya-Vij&ntilde;&#257;na implants that the various kids use to pilot the mobile suits are implied to be something of a hybrid between this and a traditional interface.

First of all, the Alaya-Vijnana system works in a way that makes it similar to the Psycoframes. Second, the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a> isn't outright evil (we've seen him fight on Tekkadan's side once or twice, like Quattro Bajeena fought alongside the AEUG). Then there's the fact that several Mobile Suits in IBO look like their designs were based on mobile suits from either 0079 or Z (such as Carta Issue's Gaplant-lookalike). And now, in Episode 24, during the heroes' first fight in a city, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Graze Ein appears out of nowhere, taking Tekkadan by surprise, much the same way the Psyco Gundam appeared in Z, except Graze Ein didn't have to transform before wreaking havoc</span>.</li><li> The new Shiden mobile suit of season 2 is a pretty obvious one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Kai Shiden.</a></li><li> Episode 34, which features the debut of the Gundam Vidar, is called "Vidar Rising".

Even after being informed of their real names, he keeps calling them such.<ul><li> Shino's bad habit is renaming every mobile suit he owns as <em>Ryusei-Go</em> (Unit Meteor), even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his Gundam Flauros (which became <em>Ryusei-Go IV</em>)</span>.

By the time Tekkadan reached Edmonton, the residents have been evacuated so that Gjallarhorn could make a defense against Tekkadan. But Ein entered the city to kill Kudelia until Mikazuki stopped him and their fight caused so much collateral damage in the city. In the end, no one calls out on both sides for this. But again, Ein was a <em>Gjalllarhorn soldier</em> who started it so that's probably added on the list of crimes filed against the group.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a>: Mikazuki, in particular, is fond of this. Unlike some of his opponents, he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">whatever it takes</a> to defeat his enemy. Against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, this usually translates to quick (if spectacularly messy) shots to the cockpit, but anyone who can survive against him without being instagibbed will frequently find themselves subjected to an eye-wateringly brutal beatdown as he gradually wears them down until he can finally manage to kill them.

Violence is an unwelcome and relatively infrequent intrusion into the cast's lives, and generally consists of traumatised children engaging in bloody gun-battles as towering war-machines rip their enemies (and their squishy, vulnerable pilots) apart with huge, evil-looking weapons. Most of the rest of the show consists of exploring a world ravaged by war, and the downright alarming psychological/physical impact it has on those forced to fight.

While they had fought plenty of skirmishes and fairly minor engagements up until that point, episode 24 opens on the tail end of a three-day battle, with Tekkadan taking heavy casualties among their rank-and-file (rather than a handful of losses during especially dangerous missions, such as boarding actions on enemy ships) for the first time.
