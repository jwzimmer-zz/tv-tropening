With advances in technology, dueling has evolved into a popular spectator sport known as "Turbo Duels". Such duels are conducted astride specially-equipped motorbikes known as "Duel Runners". However, traditional-style standing duels are still conducted just as often.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The show presents a juxtaposition between the technologically-advanced Neo Domino City and "Satellite" - the common name for the now-derelict location of the original series. Satellite is where all of Neo Domino's trash goes - both literal and human. Two years before the start of the series, protagonist and Satellite resident Yusei Fudo constructed his own <em>white</em> Duel Runner. In a flashback, Yusei lost a duel to his friend Jack Atlas, who took Yusei's Duel Runner and ace monster (Stardust Dragon) and escaped to Neo Domino City. Jack has subsequently been established as the "Master of Faster", with the help of his own ace monster (Red Dragon Archfiend) as well as the backing of the mysterious Rex Goodwin. After building a new <em>red</em> Duel Runner, Yusei makes his way to Neo Domino to duel Jack and retrieve his ace monster. Meanwhile, other events bring Yusei to the enduring attention of Neo Domino Security officer, Tetsuo Trudge. As the series goes on, there turns out to be much more at stake than realized, all tying to Yusei's past and how the city became the way it is.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Depending on who you ask, there are either three to five seasons (Episodes 1-26, which include the Prison Arc and the Fortune Cup, as the first season; episodes 27-64, or the Dark Signer Arc, as the second; episodes 65 to 103 as season three, 104 to 137 as the fourth, and 138 to 154 counting as a fifth) or two seasons (consolidating the entire 1-64 stretch as the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> and 65 and beyond as a second.)

This is really, <em>really</em> jarring, especially after you've just seen the low anime framerate cause the drawn D-Wheel to jerk onto the track in a rapid series of 1-metre hops. Jack's and Yusei's dragons are also frequently shown in CGI. Though as the series has gone on, this has gotten progressively less jarring.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: A lot of plot lines got abandoned in between Seasons 1 and 2, mostly due to the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

This would be ignored for quite some time once Crow became the Fifth Signer and he got Black-Winged Dragon in Season 2, with the identity of the fifth dragon not being revealed until the series was concluding, where it was revealed that the dragon was Power Tool's true form, Life Stream Dragon, and that Leo was not the <em>Fifth</em> Signer, but the unheard of <em>Sixth</em> Signer</li><li> Towards the end of Season 1, Carly gives Jack a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDeclarationOfLove">Dying Declaration of Love</a> once he defeats her as a Dark Signer.

Akiza's psychic powers are largely ignored outside of physically manifesting monsters, and abruptly disappear mid-season in time to bench her against Team Catastrophe, and only return near the series conclusion with little explanation. The Arcadia Movement itself is never brought up again, despite <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

This never gets brought up again for the rest of the series afterwards.</li><li> Two early Season 2 episodes have Akiza get her riding duel license and her own D-Wheel, while Rua and Ruka debuted the "Duel Board" which allowed them to Riding Duel as well. After the initial episodes showing these developments, Aki got to Riding Duel <em>once</em> in the WRGP, and was defeated in one episode. Leo and Luna didn't get to Turbo Duel again <em>ever</em>.</li><li> Thanks to the dub ending during the duel against Aporia, the outcome of the duel, the Ark Cradle, Z-one and Bruno's true identities, and the mysterious sixth Signer Dragon are never explored.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero">Action Hero</a>: Yusei briefly goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a> on a couple of guards in one episode.

Episodes 94 and 95 are also pretty bad, upgrading a (non-supernatural) card's threat from reasonable in this series (the special effects are too realistic and cause actual, possibly lethal damage) to ridiculous (causes real damage and <em>can send victims to the netherworld</em>.)</li><li> Episode 1 rewrites the plot to have it so that Jack set Rally up in an elaborate plot to take a chip for Yusei's D-Wheel. It may seem like Jack is changed to be more malicious, but this was done all to simply ignore the fact that Rally just <em>stole</em> the chip in the Japanese version where Jack was not involved at all.</li><li> In the episode where they explain how Jack got Stardust Dragon from Yusei, the scene where in the Japanese version he knocks out Rally by Vulcan Neck Pinching him is changed so that he... kind of sticks something in his neck that makes a beeping sound, I guess. It looks he he pressed a button and turned him off somehow.</li><li> It's kind of subtle, but the dub doesn't make Satellite out to be as much of a gritty and depressing hellhole as the Japanese version does (including cutting out Ushio's "Satellite scum" slurs). But hey, this is a kid's show, right?</li><li> Several episodes edit out the blood when people get injured, no matter how little it is. Yusei's rather obvious injury in episode 35 with a large piece of sharpanel <em>sticking out of his gut</em> is also changed to him having an internal injury... or something.</li><li> Various forms of torture are cut out or downplayed, including Yusei receiving his criminal marker in episode 6 (from a laser causing him to collapse in pain is to a harmless spray instead that he asks if it's "supposed to tickle"), Takasu shocking Yusei to see if his Dragon Birthmark would reveal itself (omitted), and video of a kid in the Arcadia movement in episode 42 (from being electrocuted to generating the electricity itself - ignoring the fact that the kid is clearly <em>in pain</em>), and Kiryu receiving his criminal marker and getting beaten up in jail (episode 55, also omitted).</li><li> Aki's cleavage is erased. (Her skirt is lengthened and her garters are usually erased as well, which in turn give her Grade-A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki">Zettai Ryouiki</a>.) Aside from the editing often being inconsistent between shots, it was poorly done at times (Why does Aki have shading from cleavage when she doesn't even have cleavage?!) This edit becomes especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> after Aki dons her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">cleavage-errific</a> riding suit for the first time in episode 75. Misty's (huge) and Angela's (not quite as huge) cleavage is likewise censored, and scantily-clad Duel Spirits like Ruka's Sunny Pixie are covered up.</li><li> The flames, (as in, <em>on fire</em>) that make up the geoglyphs where battles with Dark Signer battles are held are referred to as mist instead. Which seems kind of strange in episode 34 when Yusei is thrown in to the "mist" and starts howling in pain (I guess it's scalding like a steam geyser?). Of course, it helps these flames are already colored purple. The "purple mist" resurfaces much later, in the flashbacks from episodes 94 and 95, where Crow investigates a friend's <strike>murder</strike> disappearance.<ul><li> On a related note, Episode 44 omits a scene where the Dark Signers' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfDoom">Fog of Doom</a> vaporizes everyone in Satellite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except Crow.</span> This edit seems a little strange because it explains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where the Satellite citizens sacrificed to the Earthbound Gods came from.</span></li></ul></li><li> All the references to the Goodwins' severed arms in the Dark Signer arc are cut. Rudger only removed his Dragon Birthmark (the rest of the arm is digitally edited out), and Rex's mechanical arm is implied to only be a gauntlet over his real arm that helps transfer the mark. And of course, Rex never lost his own arm riding off the Daedalus Bridge.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rudger's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> moment with Yusei</span> as the former dies is changed around for the dub. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the Japanese version, after his loss against Yusei, Rudger pulls a switch on his mechanchial left arm, blowing up the bridge he and Yusei are on and sending Yusei plummenting into the Old Momentum itself.</span> In the English Dub, footage is awkwardly moved around so that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bridge blows up when Stardust Dragon attacks Earthbound God Uru. Which seems a little strange, becuase when, Uru, a friggin' giant, attacked Yusei directly earlier, the bridge didn't break or anything. And of course, it's unlikely that Stardust Dragon's attack would blow up the entire bridge or put its owner in danger.</span></li><li> Episode 59 removes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack and Carly</span>'s mutual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a> to leave their relationship on a more platonic level. Then again, this may be because later episodes have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of an estrogen brigade fighting over him, which wouldn't work so well if one of the girls was his official love interest.</li><li> The scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack's robot double is destroyed (in Episode 84) is cut, so instead of watching the robot's "skin" graphically melt off, Yusei and crew figure out that the culprit was a robot because...it made a "robotic"-sounding scream when defeated.</span></li><li> The Crash Town arc, full-stop. Kiryu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> attitude is replaced with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a> one (somewhat, as he's still obsessed with punishing himself), the shock collars that electrocute the miners have their shocks removed (<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">so it looks like the collars are ''strangling'' them</a>), and the gun-themed monsters are of course edited to look different, and in Gatling Ogre's case, removed entirely (the footage of it attacking Ramon is obviously removed to the point of paining the viewer). And, in true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">Never Say "Die"</a> fashion, the "graveyard" where the dead miners have their Duel Disks thrown is revised as memorials to their lost freedom, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the shot of Nicko and West's father falling to his death is cut entirely, replaced with him yelling for them to escape with the end of the arc stating he survived</span>. Particularly bad is the climax of the duel with Lotten&mdash;in the original Japanese Kiryu turned Lotten's effect damage back at him and tricked him into destroying himself, while in the English version, due to the gun monsters present in said climax, the <em>entire</em> sequence is removed, and Kalin just hands Lotten over to security deciding he's too much of a coward to be defeated in a fair duel. The <em>only</em> thing that isn't edited in this arc, surprisingly, are the gun-shaped Duel Disks.</li><li> Episode 108 cuts out a few instances of falling glass, which considering no one is actually shown getting hurt, is somewhat silly, and 109 cuts out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Placido making a tornado with Wisel, and Aki trying to save a little girl from the winds</span>. Consequently, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shooting Star Dragon could not disperse the tornado, so the footage had to be cut</span>.

The trope reaches it's natural conclusion when Ushio and Yusei end up having a very friendly heart to heart talk about what Yusei will do at the end of the series, a very stark contrast to the first episode where Ushio calls him trash and seeks to bring him down for riding a D-Wheel.</li><li> And Rua. He starts off an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">naive kid</a> who admires Jack and cried whenever he lost a duel. Across the second season, he deluded himself with a want to be the final Signer, only for that to get smashed by Divine. He begins to grow up and realises the seriousness of the situation, going with the Signers although it pains him that he can't do anything to help his sister, then throws himself into a duel against Demak so she won't have to fight (despite numerous claims from Demak that a non-Signer can't win). Partway into the third season, he gets a chance to prove himself again, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using himself as a shield to protect Ruka and almost dying.

Rua uses alot of cards with references to popular childrens anime as a base. Deformer Chakkan is pretty obviously a reference to "Golden Warrior Gold Lightan".</li><li> In an interesting example, there have been several one-shot characters whose designs are clearly taken from the Toei <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> series, the 1998, 27-episode "Yu-Gi-Oh: Shadow Games" (commonly known in fandom as "Season Zero").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a> gets its fair share of shout-outs.</li><li> In the dub episode with FAKE!JACK, before REAL!JACK used his last attack, he says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">"It's time for the real Jack Atlas to stand up"</a>. The origin is an old game show To Tell The Truth, which Eminem was referencing.</li><li> Heck, there's even a reference to Mobile Suit Gundam 00. The design of Seven Swords Warrior is very similar to the 00 Raiser's design, except without the main-section of the 0 Raiser (the part where Saji usually sits with the Red Haro). Its name alone is a reference to both Exia and 00 Raiser's upgrades (though the latter only appeared in the manga sidestories): the Seven Swords System. Seven Swords Warrior seems, however, to be using a mix between Exia's swords and 00 Raiser's swords, most notably Exia's two extra physical swords and the 00 Raiser's GN Buster Sword II. Speaking of Gundam, Katsumi Ono (the director of 5D's) has said that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yusei turning gold during the Delta Accel Synchro summon</span> came from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G-Gundam's</a> hyper mode.</li><li> Jack's got the need. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">The need for speed.</a></li><li> There's a good one lost completely by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a> of Bomber to Greiger. During his duel with Crow, he activates a trap called Basara. It sacrifices a monster, turns said monster into fire and the monster destroys another and deals 800 damage.

Examples include Mimi in 2010 (has a card that cant be destroyed by battle, easily summoned with 4000 ATK, supported with a relatively good Spell/Trap/Monster line-up) and Minegishi in 2011 (A Chaos DAD deck with good Spell/Trap line-up with quality on par with a Tournament level deck)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The player</span> in Chapter 1 of WC 2010. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Okita and Liquid</span> in Chapter 4.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a>: "Don't touch the computer on your right.

They turn blank again after the duel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">Compressed Adaptation</a>: Story Mode in each of the World Championship series games adapts each season of the 5D's anime. Due to the player having little to no common backstory with the established cast and taking part in all the plot-important duels, several backstory-relevant conflicts are left out of the narrative. <em>Over the Nexus</em> ends at the defeat of Yliaster in the finale of the WRGP, and doesn't go into the Ark Cradle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>: Any card that requires a coin flip or die roll will almost always turn out in the computer's favor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>: Many of the Hairstyles in World Championship resemble those of characters in the previous series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection">Copy Protection</a>: Pirated copies of WC 2010 and 2011 has the game start with an anti-piracy warning before the title screen. Continuing past that will result in certain plot-progressing events missing, and the computer never making its move in Duels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a>: The Story Mode of <em>Over the Nexus</em> ends with the Yliaster trio's defeat at the end of the WRGP, without touching the Ark Cradle. Justified as, at the time of the game's release, the card game had yet to include Aporia's cards and Z-One's cards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sim</a>: A mild version in the Tag Force games</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>:<ul><li> Crow in World Championship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In 2010, He was suposed to be the fifth Signer, but was scrapped so the Player can become it instead. And in 2011, he is injured through most of the final chapter (Alongside everyone else, minus you, Yusei and Jack), forcing you to take his place.</span></li><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bruno, whose role is replaced by Misaki.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>: Inverted/Averted in WC 2011, who keeps Team Satisfaction and Team Ragnarok's names as is. The former were called by their dub name (The Enforcers) in WC 2010, and the latter hadn't appeared in the dub at the time of the game's release.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Dude Magnet</a>: Angie across all three World Championship games is seen tagging with a different boyfriend each time. There's even a sidequest in WC 2011 where her boyfriends from 2009 and 2010 Duel her and the player to try and win her back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness">Evil Tower of Ominousness</a>: Yggdrasill in <em>Duel Transer</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The player</span> in Rudger's story in Tag Force 4.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamBoss">Final-Exam Boss</a>: The final boss of WC 2010 is challenged in a Riding Duel, Tag Duel, and then a standard Duel. Fortunately, you get opportunities to save between each.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>: The Junk frame &mdash; a D-Wheel body available in WC 2010 and 2011 &mdash; is available very early on, offering excellent handling and is fully customizable (whereas other fully customizable frames become available only in the final few chapters), but has terrible endurance. One collision with it can easily force the player to start their race segment again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>: It's supposed to be extremely difficult to construct a deck full of cards with any sort of power for those who live in the Satellite, but when you're actually playing not only does every person have a full deck, but they tend to be extremely powerful ones at that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>: WC 2011 has a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">female Bruno.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodMorningCrono" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodMorningCrono">Good Morning, Crono</a>:<ul><li> <em>Reverse of Arcadia</em> and <em>Over the Nexus</em> begin with the player character awakening in their quarters.</li><li> Most of the events in Tag Force as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenEyes">Hidden Eyes</a>: The main character of Tag Force.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou">It's Up to You</a>: While it has become standard for the player to be the one involved in all the important Duels, the trope becomes exaggerated with the WRGP duels in WC 2011. The player <em>must</em> sweep through the remaining opposition for their team, even in instances where there is a third member who could pick up their slack should they be defeated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">The Magic Poker Equation</a>: Destiny Draws in Tag Force, which allow you to draw a card you need to get out of a tough situation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>: Present in World Championship. After clearing the main storyline, you can start the game over with the same cards, recipes and character that you used in your previous playthrough.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>: It's often difficult for those who aren't well versed in the game or without cheating devices, to get off the ground as the starting decks are crap and you must progress in the game a fair bit in order to unlock the packs with decent cards. It is not uncommon for the player in WC 2009 to find themselves using only the three Synchros they begin the game with until the end- or post-game. 2010 and 2011 got better in that regard by making Synchros and Structure Decks accessible sooner.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>: You can port in recipes from Tag Force 3 to Tag Force 4 and the same goes for 4 to 5. And use UMD recognition for both games using the old Tag Forces to unlock cards and characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a>: WC 2009 and WC 2010 are simplified versions of the first two seasons of 5Ds, though the Dark Signer arc had a <em>lot</em> of twists and turns and the game still manages to include most of them. WC 2011 is even more pragmatic; most of the third season of 5Ds was a bunch of personal growth stories for side characters before Yliaster showed up, so instead they made up their own group of unique characters for the video game's protagonist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>: The Duel Puzzles in each game pit the player in a situation with a fixed board state and hand, with the challenge of winning that very turn. <em>Over the Nexus</em> introduces a Duel Puzzle editor to allow the player to make and share their own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a>: The heart system for Tag Force.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>: Crow and Kiryu in Chapter 2 WC 2010 go through one after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Team Dirty Works attemps to kidnap Itsuki</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsertFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsertFic">Self-Insert Fic</a>: The entire game plot of both World Championship games is essentially the same as the anime with your character inserted. Mostly averted in <em>Over the Nexus</em>, which has you as a totally unrelated character from Crash Town with his/her own friends unique to the game. The final few chapters, though, force your character into Yusei's role like with the rest of the games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Sequential Boss</a>:<ul><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">four clones of yourself</span> in 2009.

Both you and your opponent's fields now carry over to the next Duel, making it easy to snowball to victory if you establish board dominance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>: The ending of pretty much every single female character's storyline in the Tag Force games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>: In Tag Force 5, Sherry mentions that she was living in your own apartment for quite some time, and that she can't sleep well at night because "She has no one to hold her".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a>: At certain point in WC 2009, both your deck and D-Wheel are taken by Securities, so you have to sneak in the Securities Impound to get them back.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>. Carried over to 2010, but this time, it's only your deck.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a>: Chapter 2 of WC 2011 is all about this.

And no, You can't avoid <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being lured into a fake D-Wheel shop, buying fake D-Wheel parts and getting said parts stolen by the same person who took you there in the first place</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a>: Okita and Liquid in Reverse of Arcadia, West and Nico in Over the Nexus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">&iexcl;Three Amigos!</a>: The player, Toru and Misaki in WC 2011.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">Video Games Always Spoil</a>:<ul><li> In the English release, WC 2010 spoils the conclusion of the Dark Signer arc <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Minus Crow getting the tail birthmark</span> and Aki learning how to ride a D-Wheel. It also (for both the Japanese and Americans) shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the heart birthmark almost a full year before the anime</span>. Tag Force 5 manages to spoil a lot of things in season three for English players as well.</li><li> Tag Force 6 will reveal to dub watchers Zone's identity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or at least who he appears to be</span>. It'll be the only way they learn due to the anime ending prematurely just before the Ark Cradle appears. That is, assuming dub watchers can even get their hands on and play Tag Force 6 (see No Export For You above).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a>:<ul><li> Any of the racing segments in the WC games. Your Deck will not help you progress if you can't outrun Trudge.</li><li> When dueling in Crash Town, instead of the usual rock-paper-scissors routine, the player to decide who goes first is determined by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickTimeEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickTimeEvent">Quick Time Event</a>. This is an adaptation of Crash Town's quick-draw rule in the anime, where the player to first deploy their Duel Disk gets the first turn.</li><li> The Ghost attack in WC 2011 applies this to the racing segments. Speed and handling of the bike suddenly becomes less relevant in favour of durability to withstand the Ally Salvos.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">When She Smiles</a>: Misaki in the 2011 ending. <a class="urllink" href="http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t125/gagagio/07c56133bf074f81dffe23fd7f9063ce.png">Oh, when she smiles,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> indeed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>: The player can be this in Tag Force, as he's not limited to using a specific type of deck.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>: Dark Signer Misty in Tag Force 4.</li></ul></div><hr>
