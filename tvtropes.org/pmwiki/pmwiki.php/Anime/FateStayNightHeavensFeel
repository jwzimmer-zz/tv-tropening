First announced in 2014, <em>Heaven's Feel</em> was originally going to be released as a single film, but was split into a trilogy so as to include all - or at least most - of the vast amount of story contained in that story arc of the visual novel, which is by far the longest one in the game.</p><p>The story starts off more or less the same as the previous two routes: at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fourth Holy Grail War</a>, Kiritsugu Emiya rescues and adopts a young boy named Shirou, but passes away a few years later, leaving young Shirou trying to leave up to his adopted father's ideal of becoming a "Hero of Justice" who can save all people, despite having learned only some basic magecraft to do so.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Ten years later, the Fifth Holy Grail War starts, and Shirou, now in his late teens, gets dragged into the conflict by accident, including inadvertently summoning his own servant: Saber, the same servant who served his own father in the previous war. He also forms an alliance with fellow classmate and secret mage Rin Tohsaka, who also participates in the war, and her mysterious servant, Archer. From there on, the story completely deviates from what was seen in the previous two routes.</p><p>This trilogy presents an alternate take on the Fifth Holy Grail War from that seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightUnlimitedBladeWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightUnlimitedBladeWorks">Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]</a></em>. This time, the story focuses on Shirou's budding romance with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SempaiKohai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SempaiKohai">junior schoolmate</a> Sakura Matou, but in the process, he uncovers a dark secret about her and her family that threatens to destroy the world. In this situation, Shirou will have to choose between upholding his ideal of "Hero of Justice who can save everyone" and his desire to protect the girl he loves over everything else.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The story of <em>Heaven's Feel</em> is, by far, the darkest in all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, both in tone, themes and imagery, being often akin to a horror story. Expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>, even for characters who seemed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> in previous routes. And since, this being a movie, the creators didn't have to hold back on the graphic material like in previous adaptations, you can also expect those deaths <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">to NOT be pretty</a> and the movie to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">every excruciating detail</a>. This also applies to the sexual content (particularly in the second movie), which in previous adaptations was infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">tip-toed around</a>, partly because in previous routes, the sex scenes were a bit tacked-on due to the visual novel having originally been an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HGame">eroge</a>. However, Shirou and Sakura's relationship has a strong sexual component that is much more central to both the plot and their character development, so it would have been much more difficult to adapt out. Although the films never get as graphic as the visual novel in this respect, they don't shy away from showing it either.</p><p>The first preview can be viewed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X7JEFF9mvs">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the second preview <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnkDLYf8mro">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and third preview <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsdsOWs9nWw">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>The first film, titled <em>Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel I. presage flower</em>, was released on October 14, 2017. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AniplexUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AniplexUSA">Aniplex USA</a> has, naturally, picked up the movies and screened the first film in U.S. theatres, with the L.A. debut on November 3, 2017, with wider limited release beginning on November 18th. The English dubbed version was screened in theatres on June 5 and 7, 2018.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadmanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadmanEntertainment">Madman Entertainment</a> has picked up the movies for Australian &amp; New Zealand release and premiered the first film at their MadFest Melbourne convention on November 4, 2017, with a wider release following after on November 16.</p><p>The second film, titled <em>Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. lost butterfly</em> released in Japanese theaters on January 12, 2019. A premier screening took place in Los Angeles on February 23, followed up with a wider release in North American theaters on March 14.</p><p>The final film, titled <em>Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel III. spring song</em> was initially scheduled for release on March 28th, 2020, but was then delayed to April 25th due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusDisease2019Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusDisease2019Pandemic">the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</a> before finally being released on August 15th.

In the visual novel as it was originally written, each instance of sex results in Shirou losing a significant amount of mana to Sakura, which is a serious problem because this causes Archer's transplanted arm to take over more of his body and mind, which a human cannot handle. He wakes up after each session feeling weakened and as if something was taken from him, but cannot remember because of the brain damage accumulating within him. Sakura is fully aware of how much she is hurting him but is too selfish to stop. The movie doesn't imply any of this and opts instead to portray it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex">a loving couple enjoying themselves</a>, with no ill effects upon Shirou.</span></li><li> Also another instance in the same movie, Rin is much less snippy and antagonistic towards Sakura than she was in the visual novel.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: In the first movie, a lot of scenes were either changed or removed from the original VN to fit into the time slot. These scenes were either scenes that were already in other routes or stuff that wasn't essential to the plot.<ul><li> In the second film, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> part where Illya sings Die Lorelei</span> along with other parts of the VN are cut and put in a montage. And all of these cut scenes are very essential to the plot, among others that also weren&#146;t included in the film.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The films add some scenes that were not present in the VN.<ul><li> The beginning of the first film shows Shirou's First Year, how he met Sakura, and how his relationship with Sakura grew. All of these were either just flashbacks or briefly mentioned in the VN.</li><li> The fight between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lancer and True Assassin</span>, is a lot more elaborate in the film then it was in the VN, where it was mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As opposed to meeting True Assassin at the Ryuudou Temple and quickly pressuring him near the lake, the movie goes out of its way to showcase what Lancer is capable of when he's out to <em>kill</em> his opponent. True Assassin is no slouch in this regard either, as both run, jump and attack each other in the city's highway and skyscrapers. One can tell that the most of the budget for this movie went into this battle.</span></li><li> A minor one that helps keep Saber as a strong fighter is how she was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">grabbed and corrupted by the Shadow. In the VN, Saber gets grabbed and that is it. In the movie, Saber gets grabbed by it and actually resists, using Excalibur, Mana Burst, and her Magic Resistance to try and push the corruption back. Unfortunately, True Assassin strikes during this, and she allows herself to be consumed</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The film shows us more about how the Shadow corrupts Saber by having her be confronted by Saber Alter. With the implications being that it's all taking place inside her mind, this explains more about how the corruption works for Servants, and how Saber's beliefs do get twisted</span>.<ul><li> For that matter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Saber Alter comes across as more of a character with personality and agency, albeit very stoical and emotionless, unlike the game where she was little more than a killing doll</span>.</li></ul></li><li> While its implied in the original novel, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Berserker's final battle against Saber, after she becomes blackened, showcases the hero's last stand against her overwhelming might and all of his desperate attempts to kill her before he falls to her sword and then consumed by the Shadow.</span></li><li> The Shadow stabs Archer and then blows up like a balloon; the resultant explosion leading to Shirou losing his arm and Archer's death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The film goes further as it shows Archer actually <em>resisting corruption from the Shadow's touch</em> and using the last of his strength in a futile attempt to protect everyone from the boom: generating Rho Aias and holding back the explosion before it overwhelms him.</span></li><li> Gilgamesh gets one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when facing off against Sakura. He is <strong>furious</strong> at her for almost making him kneel before her and stands his ground, whereas in the visual novel he felt fear and even considered fleeing.</span></li><li> When Shirou views the ancestral memories of the Einzbern thanks to Illya, we get to see the initial ritual that led to the creation of the Greater Grail, in full detail as Justeaze is sacrificed to become the core, while Zelretch supervises everything.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg">Ain't Too Proud to Beg</a>: Shinji pathetically begs Zouken for another chance after he loses his first battle as a Master. Zouken hears none of it and practically admits that he never expected <em>anything</em> from his grandson.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">Always Save the Girl</a>: Shirou's main conflict in the trilogy in a nutshell. Shirou realizes his feelings for Sakura and becomes determined to protect her even as it becomes obvious that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura living will kill countless innocent people thus conflicting with his singular desire to become a hero</span>. This is even shown as Shirou changes his goal of becoming a hero, to becoming only Sakura's hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">no matter the cost</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndShowItToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndShowItToYou">And Show It to You</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">True Assassin's Noble Phantasm.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>: Several times in this trilogy.<ul><li> Archer saves Saber by cutting off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caster's arm, which held Rule Breaker.</span></li><li> Berserker <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">loses his limbs several times against Saber Alter before God Hand restores him back to normal.

Despite Sakura's wishes not to fight and harm her loved ones, Rider will do everything in her power to keep her Master safe, even if the world <em>burns</em>.

Given the amount of violence and darkness our characters go through, this is a given. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in a refreshing turn of events, the second movie adds in an original scene where she visits Shirou's house to cheer Sakura up during one of her sick spells. As Sakura is going through major self-depreciation, Taiga reassures her that she is loved by those around her (Shirou, Rin, herself, etc) and that it's okay to rely on others, especially Shirou, since he is emulating his father, Kiritsugu, as a "Hero of Justice"; this conversation also inadvertently causes Illya to finally forgive her father for "abandoning" her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a>: Zouken is a master of this trope, gleefully smiling like the lunatic he is whenever he confronts his enemies.

She even goes into more detail regarding Kiritsugu's "business trips" and how he, despite being in failing health, never missed an opportunity to travel in search of his <em>precious person</em>. That person was Illya, who was eavesdropping on their conversation, making her realize that her father never stopped loving her and was always trying to reunite with her.
