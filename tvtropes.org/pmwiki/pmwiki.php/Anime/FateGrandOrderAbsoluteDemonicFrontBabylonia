Here, he lets his actions and capabilities speak for himself. Furthermore, whereas he always goes into a fight expecting to win/be superior, here he fights about as good as his opponents deserve&mdash;commenting only on whether they are useful or not.</li><li> His self-respect: Originally, the Archer Gilgamesh expects everyone to bow/follow him, and will openly destroy/kill anyone who seems to be treating him beneath his own self-belief. Here, he has no issues praising people more openly, treating them with kindness/encouragement (especially the children), and even takes comments on his attitude in stride.</li><li> His view on fakes/imitations: He is best remembered to massively despise anyone who aspires to reach his level (as his disdain for both Archer and Emiya Shirou in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightUnlimitedBladeWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightUnlimitedBladeWorks">Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]</a></em> suggests).

She also easily defeats Ana in the throne room of Uruk and only halts her assault when she realizes who Ana is and what her role is. Given that she's the goddess of power and war, this is to be expected.</li><li> Jaguar Warrior, a <em>bunrei</em> related to the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca, mops the floor with both Mash and Ana upon first meeting her despite being <em>doubly</em> handicapped; one by having to possess a human and two by not being on the land they originated on. Merlin states plainly that they have no hope of fighting her unless they also have someone with divinity on their side, and the group is forced to retreat.</li><li> Gorgon is a bit of a strange case. She is a monster but is also a god which is strictly speaking impossible. The higher one's monster value is the lower your divinity values are. She gets around this by using the grail to grant her the divinity she had before becoming a monster.</li><li> Much like Jaguar Warrior, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quetzalcoatl</span> is doubly handicapped by not being a native to the land and also not being in her original form. However in her mythology she is holds the same seat of power as Zeus or Amaterasu and she also controlled the sun at one point.

Since her character development happened in the previous singularities that were not part of the anime, the ending of episode 0 provides a montage of those stories while characters from them speak to Mash about why humanity is great (all of which are real things they said during the game).</li><li> Episode 3 has Fujimaru and Mash helping out around Uruk like in the game. Unlike the game however, where the chapters were combat chapters where the characters helped out with a seemingly innocent task only for there to be battle for the sake of gameplay, the anime simply skips the middleman and actually shows them busy at work. Since those chapters in-game are quite lengthy (and even then there's a lot implied to be abridged as they report to Gilgamesh) and engage in a more tone-breaking sense of humor, this gets across Uruk as a fully living city, why Mash and Fujimaru are going to protect it, and what exactly Gilgamesh values from his citizens.</li><li> Episode 4 shows Da Vinci and Romani discussing how Rayshifting to the Age of Gods is almost impossible for Chaldea.
