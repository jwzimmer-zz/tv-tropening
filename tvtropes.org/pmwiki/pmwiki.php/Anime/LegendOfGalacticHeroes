(It is, therefore, longest-running OVA of all time, although it <em>was</em> later shown on TV.) This is in Japan, of course, as neither the anime, nor the manga, nor the huge series of novels written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshikiTanaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshikiTanaka">Yoshiki Tanaka</a> which spawned the franchise have ever been released in America... until Anime Expo 2015, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> licensed the novels and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a> licensed the OVA which is now available on Hidive. (A noble yet feeble attempt at licensing a dub version of the anime was made many years ago, but no one bit, and thus the <em>only</em> way the series was accessible in English until recently was via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSub">Fan Sub</a>.)</p><p>The meat of the story is this: sometime in the 36th century (the narrative of the main series takes place between January 3596 and July 3601), humanity has spread out amongst the stars and has split off into two great superpowers which are now sadly engaged in a decades-long knock-down, drag-out war with each other. Fighting in the forces of the Galactic Empire (whose government and society are based on 19th century Prussia) is the ambitious young noble named Reinhard von M&uuml;sel, better known by the name granted to him later, Reinhard von Lohengramm. Fighting for the opposing Free Planets Alliance (a government which resembles a crumbling, bloated 20th century democracy) is Yang Wen-li, an easygoing historian who only reluctantly joined the military because he was broke. Together, these two men, both tactical geniuses, are destined for greatness. They become the series' titular <em>Galactic Heroes.</em></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The story is played straight and seriously and is crammed with detail. It's also crammed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">characters</a>, from the big players at the top of the government to the lowly farmers and grunt soldiers at the bottom who get everything done. There's so many, in fact, that each episode always shows a character's name when they first shows up on screen in case you forgot who they were. At times, this can become confusing, to the point where you need a scorecard to keep all of the character's names and ambitions straight. The pace of the story can also be slow. It's possible to watch an episode in which the heroes prepare for an invasion, skip ahead three episodes, and find the heroes <em>still</em> preparing for it.</p><p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-12/legend-of-the-galactic-heroes-novels-get-anime">A new anime adaptation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by Production I.G., subtitled <em>Die Neue These</em>, was released in April 2018.

Most notably, the anime introduced the concept of Iserlohn Fortress having liquid metal armor, which is arguably much more memorable than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Death Star</a>-esque solid metal fortress in the novels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: At the same time some situations are given much more attention in the anime adaption than in the books. The entire situation of the Alliance invading Imperial space and trying to liberate and supply the population lasts a few pages at most. In the anime an episode was created focusing on an Alliance officer helping to grow crops and bonding with a town's mayor and his daughter. Once the supply lines are destroyed and the Alliance need to seize back their supplies the situation becomes far more harrowing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer">The Aggressive Drug Dealer</a>:<ul><li> The Terraist Church will spike the food and beverages of pilgrims to their headquarters with the highly addictive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Thyoxin</a> to transform them into mindless slaves. And if they catch up, the Church will just bring them to the infirmary and forcefully addict them there.</li><li> Some of the side stories reveal that Thyoxin dealing was also a problem within the Imperial Fleet, with some officers pushing it on their soldiers to keep them compliant.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">Alternative Calendar</a>: The Empire uses a calendar that began with Rudolf von Goldenbaum's coronation, the "Imperial Calendar" or in gratuitous German, "Reich Calendar" (RC) With Reinhard's coronation they take the opportunity to reset the calendar and begin a new era. The Alliance resurrected the calendar used by the old Galactic Federation, the Universal Calendar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">UC</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: A downplayed, but accurate trope for Yang's fleet later on in the story. Due to certain circumstances, many notable soldiers who should be of much higher rank are unable to get promoted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>: Played both ways. Reinhard is directly compared to Rudolf von Goldenbaum. Both are/were brilliant yet frustrated with current conditions, but Rudolf's ambition drove him to declare himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">Emperor</a>. As an inversion, Reinhard's ambition that stems from his desire to reform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">protect his big sister</a> is shown as a positive trait. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't live long enough to succumb to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">Motive Decay</a>, though.</span><ul><li> Yang lacks ambition for power, money, and things like that and he is shown to be more humane and moral than Reinhard. Reinhard is a virtuous guy but sometimes his ambitions make him do some more questionable things.</li><li> On the other hand, Yang's complete lack of personal ambition mixed with his reluctance to set himself up as any sort of dictator, even a benevolent one, leaves him constantly hamstrung by the Alliance's politicians, which ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> results in the Alliance's destruction.</span> It's left up to the viewer to decide whether Yang's principled stance or Reinhard's pragmatism made for the greater man.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Terraist Church has apparently been using Fezzan to manipulate both the Empire and the Alliance for over a century.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: One of the games has two little omake parodies of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Momotaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Momotaro">Momotarou</a> story, one for the Empire's side and one for the Alliance's side, in which the characters are wearing animal costumes (with the exception of Reinhard and Julian who play the role of Momotarou). In the Empire version, Kircheis is a dog (and can't say anything other than "Yes, Annerose-sama/Reinhard-sama"), Reuenthal is an eagle, Mittermeyer is a wolf, Bittenfeld is a tiger and Oberstein is a bat. In the Alliance version, which sticks a little closer to the Momotarou story, Attenborough is a dog, Sch&ouml;nkopf is a monkey and Poplin is a pheasant... and Karin is the Queen of the demons.<ul><li> In the series proper there are quite a few, too. Mittermeyer's title of Gale Wolf, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lohengramm Dynasty's</span> winged lion and Bittenfeld's flagship <em>K&ouml;nigstiger</em>, just to name three.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>: Episode 7, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first capture of Iserlohn Fortress</span>, is noticeably better produced and animated than all preceding and many later episodes.<ul><li> The DVD editions onward feature redone animated scenes spliced with original, albeit sharpened footage, which while consistent can be jarring at times.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: Characters die, often unexpectedly, regardless of their minor or main status. Of the speaking roles in the first episode only a few characters live to see the finale. (A number don't make it past the second episode.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">Armchair Military</a>: Many of the Alliance army's top brass who got there by smooching posterior. In the Empire under the Goldenbaum dynasty, many nobles got command positions because they were from the right families.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limbs</a>: Cybernetic replacement limbs for amputees are apparently quite common in the setting, but offer no obvious advantage over natural ones. Wahlen gets one of these when his left arm had to be amputated due to an assassination attempt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFangirl">Ascended Fangirl</a>: Frederica Greenhill joined the Alliance military in part due to Yang's exploits in El Facil. To work alongside <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventually <em>marry</em></span> him must have been a dream come true for her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>: During the Third Battle of Tiamat, this was Vice-Admiral Holland's main battle plan, which he called "revolutionary tactics". While it worked for sometime, when he refused to withdraw and his fleet reached a breaking point for overextending themselves, Reinhard and his fleet obliterated him with a single barrage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>: Played straight AND subverted. In both sides of the conflict, there's people who use their authority for heavy loads of badassery and people whose authority is actually a detriment to their society.

He had dreadful grades in the military academy, but that's mostly because he never wanted to be a soldier, he wanted to be a HISTORIAN.

The former is a career naval officer wearing only his regular uniform and carrying a service pistol, the latter is the battle-hardened commander of an elite unit of infantry with a fearsome reputation wearing armour and wielding an axe.

He further assumes that the commander will assume it's a trap to get him to leave the fortress (it is; he does), and that he will leave anyway in an attempt to trap Yang's fleet (which he assumes Yang will send to the fortress as soon as he leaves; he does) between the fortress and its defense fleet. This all happens. The only thing the commander failed to realize, is that Yang planted a code in the fortress the last time he abandoned it, which allows him to disable the fortress, and capture it.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">Barbie Doll Anatomy</a>: In one of the historical documentary episodes, the naked bodies of fallen soldiers have conspicuous shadows obscuring their crotches.

This series' most distinguished characters tend to be high-ranking officers in their respective army, at least Admiral or above. There's a REASON they got that far. The most literal example of the trope, however, would be General Sch&ouml;nkopf, commanding officer of the Rosenritter, an elite assault infantry regiment recruited from exiled Imperials. Facing him in battle is a DEATH SENTENCE.<ul><li> Oskar von Reuenthal, one of only two men to fight Sch&ouml;nkopf head to head and live to tell the tale (and without armour to boot). No wonder he's one of Reinhard von Lohengramm's elite admirals.</li><li> The other, of course, being Siegfried Kircheis, who was able to face Sch&ouml;nkopf for an EVEN LONGER period of time. He was using armour, though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>: Reuenthal is a textbook case of Oedipus Complex.

The Terraists are an ancient cult that has been secretly manipulating the universe.

Her personality is the same, though, and she's just as bald as his male counterpart. (She's a lot prettier, though.

The same applies to most of the Old Guard nobles in the Empire as well; those who are not either ally themselves with Reinhard eventually or flee the country.<ul><li> Somewhat subverted with the Alliance. A good example is Vice Admiral Paetta, Yang's commanding officer at the start of the series. While he looses the few battles he appears in, according to several characters he was by all means a competent officer.

Sure, it takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a regime change</span> to fully subvert this trope since the Galactic Empire isn't precisely a bowl of peaches at the start of the series, but the Alliance starts out as mostly rotten and stays that way.<ul><li> It is actually played straight, but in a very subtle way: The Alliance is at the lowest point of its decadence at the beginning, while the empire gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a new, competent, charismatic, popular leader who crush the former rotten imperial nobility and put better, more honest people in charge of his administration</span> and reach its apex. Even so, the Alliance at its lowest, with less people, a smaller territory and less resources is more prosperous than the empire at its peak and manage to fight its militaristic enemy to a standstill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and it takes dozens of plans and the Alliance leaders screwing up with their best admiral at every turn to finally allow the empire to have the upper hand</span></li><li> In reality, the show doesn't take a true stance on which form of better. Really, it shows the positives and negatives to both sides, but doesn't single one out. Like Yang said himself, there is nothing inherently wrong with a dictatorship, it just matters who the dictator is.<ul><li> Yang Wen-li even goes so far as to say that if the Alliance was formed to oppose a ruthless dictatorship, and that it is now a BENEVOLENT dictatorship, that there's no real reason for there to be an Alliance anymore. Considering the dreadful state of the Alliance government and his position within it, those are words DANGEROUSLY similar to treason. But then again, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Yang Wen-li</a> we're talking about.</li><li> And on the other side, during the third season, Reinhard states <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that he would never have won if the idealistic people who still believed in the founding principles of the Alliance had been allowed to lead</span>. What is interesting here is that it is stated that the empire was decadent because it was ruled by aristocrats who believed to be the embodiment of value and greatness, and became better <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> once Reinhard, who was a lot more cynical even about himself, but also way more <em>competent</em> took over</span>, while the Alliance which still had some efficient politicians and intellectuals among its leaders (Trunicht was a full fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>, but was way smarter that the Empire's nobility) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but their lack of idealism was what caused the Alliance downfall</span>.

The character of a republic, even a corrupt one largely controlled by an oligarchy, is generally going to be determined by the nature of its citizens, and people on the whole trend towards the average in both abilities and morals.

This is, in fact, the reason that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yang manages to get him at gunpoint</span> in the first place, as instead of taking advantage of his present overwhelming advantage to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">end the war once and for all</span> Reinhard instead decides to set a trap for Yang using himself as bait so that he can settle once and for all who's the better commander in a head-to-head confrontation on relatively equal terms.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">Hopeless War</a>: See also the Forever War entry above. The war between the Alliance and the Empire has already killed off a substantial amount of the human population as a whole, and the Alliance is specifically mentioned as having been bled dry to the point that continuing the war will eventually cause their society to collapse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This happens sooner than later, in part due to the Alliance's high command gambling on a massive offensive after taking Iserlohn and losing spectacularly. Fezzan and the Terraists had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides">hoping to keep it going for their own reasons</a> and were likewise caught flat-footed by the Empire's sudden success</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGuyTinyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGuyTinyGirl">Huge Guy, Tiny Girl</a>: The historical document that Yang listens to while researching Bruce Ashbey's 730 Mafia specifically refers to this. Vittorio di Bertini (9th Fleet admiral) is described as a huge intimidating (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">but gentle</a>) scarred man. The document directly calls this out, referring to his wife being half his height.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite">Humans Are White</a>: The Empire seems to be all light-skinned European folk with German and Nordic names - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">for a reason</a>. The Alliance is dominated by the same light-skinned people, though with a number of dark-skinned and black people and some East Asian types (including Yang himself), which is justified as they're the descendants of both the original Heinessen settlers and Imperial dissidents. Their names suggest a wide variety of ethnic origins but the culture seems to be quite uniform, although there are traces of the original nationalities as seen by the presence of Italian cuisine and Chinese trinkets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick">Hyper-Competent Sidekick</a>: Subverted, in that, while Siegfried Kircheis is this to Reinhard, Reinhard is nowhere near ineffectual (he's the most formidable character in the series, in fact). The first time Kircheis's fleet of 2000 is sent out, it's completely on its own against a ring of satellites that decimated a fleet twice their size in seconds. The second time, he has a force of 40,000 against 50,000 enemy ships. He wins both times with minimal effort and almost never losing the soft smile on his face.<ul><li> And what about Hilda? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> having the only person able to outsmart Yang has his lover/wife/right-hand-man/heir was what allowed Reinhard to emerge victorious and alive during the second season</span>. In fact, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick">Hyper Competent Sidekicks</a> is Reinhard's MO and what differentiates him from the rest of the petty nobility of the Empire: <em>they</em> want servile underlings, <em>he</em> wants efficient officers. Reinhard even goes as far as forgiving blunders from his officers and merely requesting they do a better job next time to prove themselves. His officers are more than happy to oblige.<ul><li> "Outsmart" is perhaps too strong a term since Yang, being who he is, is most likely already aware of this option but it is one of the many disadvantages that Yang cannot or will not do anything about. Reinhard is also aware that that is the most efficient path to victory but his pride and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">worthy opponent</a> complex wants a direct victory against Yang. He felt he had lost, in terms of tactics, to Yang in all of their previous encounters and wanted to prove to everyone and to himself that he could beat Yang. If he wasn't confident he could win then he wouldn't had faced Yang but Hilda realized that the chances of Reinhard losing to Yang was high and took the appropriate actions.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>:Many High noble admirals complain that Reinhard only got his promotions because the Emperor like his sister, but most High noble admirals got their promotions largely because of their family names, not their actual merits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllKillYou">I'll Kill You!</a>: Lang learns the hard way that Mittermeyer is not as laid-back as he usually seems like.<ul><li> Even the cultured Mecklinger briefly acts like this towards one of the doctors tending to Reinhard.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">Impoverished Patrician</a>: Reinhard's family were low-ranking nobles who barely counted as among the nobility. A number of the Imperial exiles in the Alliance likewise are described as coming from disgraced or impoverished noble houses. Examples include those in the Rosenritter regiment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a>: Played straight and subverted. Reinhard and Siegfried not only made it to the admiralty at age twenty, they also had their first commands at fifteen or so and were apparently able to make the decision to enter the military academy at age <em>ten</em> without having to get approval from their parents (it's kind of justified in that their country is in the middle of a war). There is also the Alliance practice of letting 15-year olds like Julian and later Katerose pilot starfighters and participate in combat, although this too is consistent with several historical aristocratic societies. However, in the story Reinhard and Kircheis' military career is treated as extraordinary, and the Alliance tends to be strapped for soldiers (in fact, it's an in-story problem that most of their youth die at the battlefield).<ul><li> The Imperial admirals seem rather young to hold such high rank: Mittermeyer is 32 or 33 at the end of the series, Oberstein 40, and none of the others seem to be older than them (Lennenkampf is older, but he dies during the series). This is however explained in-series: Reinhard handpicked his officers based on their competence and lower background. The older (and more hidebound) officers were often promoted due to their noble background, rather than their actual merits, making them both utterly useless and contemptuous for Reinhard due to his lower background. Reinhard instead chose younger, talented officers from lower noble (just Reuenthal at first, Oberstein, Fahrenheit and Eisenach later) and commoner backgrounds(everybody else). This did several things: It gave Reinhard the support of quality admirals, the officers would be highly motivated to fight against the corrupt high nobility and fight tooth and nail to make sure it would never come back. Reinhard promotes officers based on their distinguished service, seniority be damned.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality">Infant Immortality</a>: Brutally averted.

As such, private feuds between different commanders run the risk of turning into ugly brawls or even escalating to open firefights as their followers feel motivated to back them up against their rivals. While the Goldenbaum-era division of command at Iserlohn and the Lippstadt Rebellion are the most obvious examples early in the series, not even Reinhard's best and brightest admirals are fully immune.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>: The story is teeming with all kinds of it.<ul><li> Iserlohn, an Imperial fortress cutting off the Alliance from the Empire and a symbol of Imperial might, ends up becoming a bastion of Republicanism.</li><li> Yang is a subdued and peaceful man who despises war. He figures that the more often he wins, the sooner the tide of war will change and he will be able to quietly retire. He is also one of if not <em>the</em> deadliest of military commanders alive, and his superiors soon find him indispensable on the warfront. In other words, his sheer talent prevents him from retiring early.</li><li> Reinhard, whose military career was fast tracked because of the Kaiser's love for Annerose, is despised by all sorts of nobles and high ranking military officers who take every opportunity to send him on suicide missions as an attempt to be rid of him. However, through his tactical genius, emerges victorious from every assignment and earns even more influence. Those who are smart recognize Reinhard's talent and get out of his way. Those who are not... well.</li><li> Further compounded by the fact that without Reinhard at the helm, even the unintelligent and outdated tactics used by the Alliance before Yang Wen-li had any real authority would have given the Empire a run for its money. This is possibly the one thing that kept the Empire from being outright conquered by the Alliance's crusade. Thus, by attempting to kill Reinhard, those imperial officers were inadvertently saving their nation.</li><li> Reinhard originally joined the military and aimed for power to free his sister Annerose from the emperor. Friedrich IV knows and approves of his ambitions, including to become emperor - and died before Reinhard had gained enough power to move against him.</li><li> Yang is a tactical genius who recognizes the value of strategy. Reinhard is a brilliant strategist who places greatest value in military conquest. As a result, both men envy and admire each other. If circumstances allowed them to combine, they would be the most powerful force in the universe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Wolfgang and Eva Mittermeyer</a> are unable to have children, to their sorrow. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">Reuenthal and Elfriede</a></span>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">Plenty able.</a></li><li> Rebelo grimly warns Yang that he may have to take military action opposite the Free Planets Alliance in order to protect himself, and that he wishes the time may never come. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Eventually, it is Rebelo himself who puts Yang into this very predicament.</a></span></li><li> Lennenkampf's flagship is the Garga Falmul, a mistransliteration of Farmr Galga, a name of the God Odin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The name means "Burden of the Gallows".

He never wears anything like the formal civilian wear used by his ministers while in public, even when functioning as the Prime Minister prior to his coronation or as the head of state afterwards - he seemingly always emphasises his role as a military leader.

Do not take this for a lack of competence or discipline: they know the horrors of war, and have chosen to enjoy life as much as they can between battles.

Aside from wall- or desk-mounted picturephones and personal vehicles with optional autopilot, their material culture seems to be very similar to what you would find in first-world countries during the 1980s, down to the hairstyles and fashions.

The main difference is that Reinhard, while taking him as the model for his rise, is tearing down his regime and setting up the Empire for a democracy, and Yang found himself capable of setting himself up as the dictator of the Alliance whenever he wants (and it's the reason the Alliance politicians fear him so much) and consciously <em>refuses</em> to do so.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar">Not So Similar</a>: When on the receiving end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a> offer from Reinhard, Yang rebuffs him, saying that while Reinhard wants subordinates bound to him by loyalty, Yang wants <em>friends</em> bound by mutual trust.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo">Nuclear Weapons Taboo</a>: Averted.

As far as most people are aware, he's a rather mundane monarch and former hedonist who is much more interested in gardening and culture than in actually governing the Empire, a task that's largely given to Lichtenlade. It's shown however that not only is he much keener than his unassuming persona suggests but is very much aware that the Goldenbaum Dynasty's days are fast ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And that he's always known about Reinhard's ambitions when he could have ended it all from the very beginning, believing nonetheless that Reinhard would be the one capable of bringing change to the Empire.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a>: The Alliance is so full of these, it's a miracle they get anything done.<ul><li> It is a testament to his patience worthy of the Buddha that Yang Wen-li does not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">get medieval</a> on his nation's leaders, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">how much they go out of their way to fuck with him and his plans.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome">Tall, Dark, and Handsome</a>, filthy rich aristocrat Oskar von Reuenthal who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>, all sorts of psychological issues, and is a well-known womanizer; and short, blond, commoner Wolfgang Mittermeyer who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">a paragon of all male virtues</a> (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">mostly</a>) and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to his teenage sweetheart.

Many of the larger pitched battles are brutal stalemates with millions of casualties on each side, no matter who wins in the end. The camera frequently switches to the gory deaths of mooks from both sides to highlight the horrific human suffering caused by war.

But it resurfaces in the form of the Terraist Church, as well as the somewhat hilarious Imperial penchant for invoking "the great god Odin" and Valhalla. The latter seems to be mostly a vestige and/or formalities, though, since no Imperial character is shown to be religious.<ul><li> Not quite. In the novel, Mittermeyer is shown genuinely praying to Odin at least once. Many Imperial characters actually do believe Valhalla is waiting for them in the afterlife. Moreover, only the Nordic pantheon is allowed to thrive in the Empire, while other 'gods', 'mythologies' and 'religions' are outright banned. This also applies to the Terraist Church, where they have far more success in Alliance territories but otherwise driven underground in the Empire.</li><li> In one of the side stories it is mentioned that Whit Sunday is still being celebrated, but has lost all religious meaning and is nothing but an early summer festival.</li><li> Even the Terraist Church could be a double subversion. They revere the Earth because it is the original home, the "mother" of humanity, but they do not seem to really believe in anything supernatural. Despite calling themselves "Church", they are an ultra-nationalist movement rather than a religious cult.</li><li> It's also mentioned though that most people still cling on to some idea of an afterlife as well as vestiges of old-world religions, whether it's Christianity for the Alliance or the re-purposed Odinism of the Empire.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Overly Long Name</a>: Despite the penchant for long, important-sounding names in the Galactic Empire, the winner here is actually Alliance politico Enrique Martino Borges de Arantes e Oliveira, who shows up in some six episodes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverrankedSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverrankedSoldier">Overranked Soldier</a>: Though he <em>is</em> very capable, Emperor Friedrich IV promoting twenty-year old Reinhard to Fleet Admiral in charge of half the Imperial fleet seems absurd, especially considering that there were many more experienced commanders available and the military establishment and the High Nobles oppose the appointment. Reinhard's handpicked admirals are also rather young for their posts, with the youngest, M&uuml;ller, starting out as Vice Admiral at 25 or 26 and the others not being much older, mid-30s at the most. The Alliance also does this, but to a lesser degree.<ul><li> It helps that Reinhard's sister was the emperor's favorite concubine, and Reinhard himself was in a very privileged position.
