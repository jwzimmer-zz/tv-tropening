It tells the story of Public Security Section 9, a covert counter-terrorist task force working for the Japanese government in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk">Post-Cyberpunk</a> future.

Although the plot leans action-heavy and contains loads of political intrigue, it also features a strong focus on philosophical discussions of dehumanization through technology and synthetic life.</p><p>The world of <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> differs from the worlds of the two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> feature films and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell">the original manga</a>: The feature films and the manga focus on Motoko Kusanagi and her evolution into something beyond human after her encounter with the Puppetmaster. <em>Stand-Alone Complex</em>, though, doesn't have the Puppetmaster show up in any form and Section 9 (including Kusanagi) exists as a fully functional team.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Stand Alone Complex</em> has two twenty-six episode seasons, <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em> and <em>Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C: 2nd GIG</em>. Fans often abbreviate both seasons (for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonCancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonCancer">obvious reasons</a>) as "<em>GITS:SAC</em>" (pronounced "Git-Sack" by the uncouth) and "<em>2nd Gig</em>".

The series identifies these various episodes by two letter code in their titles as being "Stand Alone" or "Complex" in season 1 and "Individual", "Dividual", or "Dual" in <em>2nd Gig</em>. The first season's "Complex" story arc focuses on the Laughing Man incident, a highly publicized kidnapping by a master hacker who can hack cyberbrains in real time, and a government coverup that led to the original event. The second season's "Individual" story arc focuses on a terrorist cell known as the Individual Eleven, led by the mysterious Hideo Kuze, as well as a "Dual" story arc that focuses on Section 9's conflict with Kazundo Gouda's Cabinet Intelligence Service. <em>GITS:SAC</em> and <em>2nd Gig</em> are available on disc either as full series, or as single discs edited down to focus on the main story. The edited versions last about two and a half hours each.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplexSolidStateSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplexSolidStateSociety">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society</a></em>, takes place two years after the end of <em>2nd Gig</em>; the story follows Section 9 as it struggles to deal with both Motoko's departure and a volatile refugee situation triggered by the actions of an entity known as the Puppeteer.</p><p>As noted above, the <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> franchise has four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">separate but equally legitimate continuities</a>: 1) the original manga, 2) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii">Mamoru Oshii</a>'s films (which themselves recreate and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">compress</a> specific parts of the manga), 3) <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> and 4) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise">Ghost in the Shell: Arise</a></em>, a prequel of sorts to the whole franchise. None of the individual continuities have any direct relation to one another aside from variants on the setting and characters, although both movies and <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> make references to/offer recreations of specific scenes from the manga.</p><p>In 2011, Kodansha Comics released a <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">manga</a> written by Yu Kinutani. Volume One is a shot-for-shot manga interpretation of the first episode, and Volume Two is a retelling of the second episode, "TESTATION". Volume Three is a retelling of the 7th episode: "IDOLATOR". Volume Four covers episode 14: "&yen;&#128;$", and Volume Five is "NOT EQUAL".</p><p>Game developer <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nexon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nexon">Nexon</a></em> had developed an online <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> based on the series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostInTheShellFirstAssaultOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostInTheShellFirstAssaultOnline">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: First Assault Online</a></em> launched in December 2015, and was available through Nexon's website and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>, but came to a close on December 6th, 2017.</p><p>You can watch the series on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hulu.com/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex">Hulu<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (only in the U.S.).

The Japan of GITS, while being something of a police state with government and intelligence service controlling the propaganda permeating the media, still has an urban middle class, nature resorts and traditional society.

His popularity, or at least his widespread social influence, is reflected when him merely making a threat against the Police Chief's life leads dozens of others, with no other prompting, to try murdering him. The South American revolutionary hero detailed in an earlier first-season episode might also qualify, though we only have Section 9's word to go on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility">Visible Invisibility</a>: Transitions between total invisibility and translucent distortion invisibility. There's at least one instance where the Major seems able to see a cloaked mech suit even when it is using its optical camouflage, and the narc squad in the same episode is explicitly stated as using cloaking technology that isn't perfect, so it seems that both types are viable. The protagonists usually don't employ their invisibility for long periods of time, presumably because it drains the batteries quickly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoicesAreMental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoicesAreMental">Voices Are Mental</a>: The cyber-telepathic "voices" of the characters sound just like their speaking voices with an electronic reverb added.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot">Vomit Indiscretion Shot</a>: "NIGHT CRUISE" shows Gino throwing up on screen.

They get tasked with shoveling dirt, which they protest because they're far more advanced and capable of doing more advanced tasks. They decide to challenge a power loader to prove they're worthy of stronger tasks, but all become overconfident and are easily beaten by the site foreman. They go back to shoveling dirt with a new appreciation for the task they're doing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>:<ul><li> While the members of Section 9 are shown using various weapons across the series, in heavy combat situations, they are mostly seen using the standard issue Seburo C26a assault rifle, and environmental variants. The weapon was inspired by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtImitatesLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtImitatesLife">FN F2000</a>. Even Togusa, who prefers to use his Mateba Autorevolver, uses this weapon in gunfights.</li><li> Additionally, most Section 9 members wield the Seburo M-5 pistol (chambered for the 7N7 5.45x18mm pistol cartridge) as their primary sidearm, exceptions being Togusa with his afore mentioned Mateba 2008M (a futuristic version of the real life 2006M) and Batou, who wields a futuristic Browning BDA variant chambered for .45 ACP and called the M-7.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingRingDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingRingDefense">Wedding Ring Defense</a>: Chief Aramaki assumes the friend he meets in London is married, she's actually using this trope to keep men at bay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillNotUsePhotoshopInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillNotUsePhotoshopInTheFuture">We Will Not Use Photoshop in the Future</a>:<ul><li> Averted when the Tachikomas point out that because it's so easy to falsify data and memories, that not even <strong>live broadcasting</strong> over television or the net can be taken as the truth.</li><li> The Laughing Man is such an expert hacker that he does this in real time by hacking into the cyberbrains of anyone who witnesses anything he does and makes them see the infamous logo or otherwise erases himself out of the viewer's eyesight, such as what he did to Batou.<ul><li> Batou himself does almost exactly the same thing afterwards; hacking a mech pilot's eyes to show his (Batou's) decapitated body where the pilot was expecting it to be. In the future, Adobe is clearly the world's most powerful corporation.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> In "NOT EQUAL", the Major and Togusa realized that something was wrong after they <em>rescued</em> Eka Tokura in Okinawa.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Old Lady:</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You got... the wrong girl.</span></div><ul><li> When the Major asks Kuze if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he can fold origami cranes left handed</span>, revealing to him that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was the little girl who became his childhood friend after they both survived a plane crash</span>.
