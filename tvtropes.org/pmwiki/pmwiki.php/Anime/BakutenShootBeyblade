"Spinsplosion" works as a translation.</span> aired from 2001 to 2003 with a season each year in Japan. American audiences got their share of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Beyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Beyblade">Beyblade</a></em> from 2002 to 2005. The first season was produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse">Madhouse</a> and the last two were done by Nihon Animedia, with some outsourcing to Synergy. The story was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">adapted</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakutenShootBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakutenShootBeyblade">manga</a> by Takao Aoki, which itself was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">reboot</a> of the events told about in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JisedaiBeigomaBattleBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JisedaiBeigomaBattleBeyblade">Jisedai Beigoma Battle Beyblade</a></em>. Also included in the anime lineup is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> <em>Beyblade: The Movie - Fierce Battle</em>, which can be considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> to the third season.</p><p>The first season narrates how the protagonists, the BBA Team, rise to the top. It starts out on neighborhood level, with a local gang of beyblading bullies terrorizing Akebono, moves to the Japanese Tournament where the protagonists become a team, then enters a series of tournaments, and finishes with the BBA being the world's last chance against a hostile takeover by Borg and Hiwatari Enterprises. Along the way, each member of the team faces a personal demon and grows both as a person and as a teammate.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Season 2 (<em>2002</em> in Japan, <em>V-Force</em> elsewhere) shifts gears, moving largely away from the tournament narrative to provide a story of the BBA Team having to defend their four sacred bit-beasts &mdash; Dragoon, Draciel, Dranzer, and Driger &mdash; from two organizations trying to steal them: the Saint Seals and Zag&#257;to Industries, which are at odds with each other too. The BBA Team's numbers increase with the addition of Hiromi, who provides support to the team alongside Ky&#333;ju.</p><p><em>Beyblade: The Movie - Fierce Battle</em> follows on Season 2, but cannot lead into Season 3 on account that Daichi has his introduction in both of them. The movie sees the BBA Team travel to Kyushu for a tournament and to spend a few days on vacation. However, on a nearby island a group of four children accidentally set the Four Holy Beasts of Darkness free and it's up to the BBA to save the world from the creatures' wrath.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Season 3 (<em>G-Revolution</em>) returns to the tournament-heavy format, but with one major twist: the BBA Team is no longer together. Max, Rei, and Kai all go to their alternative teams for their own shot at becoming the world champion. This leaves Takao to join forces with season-newcomer Daichi and his bit-beast Gaia Dragoon. The former teammates face off against each other in various rounds, but ultimately become allies again for another effort to stop the world from being taken over.</p><p>The differences between the anime and the manga are significant and plentiful. Firstly, the flow of time is different. Where in the manga everything happens within one year, each season of the anime represents a year, making for three years total. To this end, the length and amount of battles got vastly upped: the manga features a one-battle-only mode while the anime uses a best-out-of-three setup. Furthermore, in the manga, many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">team-type bladers</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">bodies at best</a> whereas the anime fleshes out as many characters as it can. One important thing to note is that the manga and anime were in part produced concurrently and Aoki did do work for the anime too. This means that on occasion it's the manga which is the adaptation rather than the other way around.</p><p>Much like other localized kid-oriented anime of the time, the English version of <em>Beyblade</em> was given a number of changes including Western names for characters, the character Dizzi's very existence, music adjustments, and removal of certain parts of the show that wouldn't fly on U.S. TV. The anime was licensed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>Bakuten Shoot Beyblade</em> contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaAdaptationTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaAdaptationTropes">adaptation</a> examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>:<ul><li> Played Straight. Many characters in the manga suffer from underdevelopment, ranging from only existing for one panel to never getting a name or a battle to participate in. The anime went on to give every single team its own set of bit-beasts and each member at least one on-screen battle.</li><li> <em>V-Force</em> is the very definition of this trope. It takes a fairly short part of the manga involving the Saint Seals, Team Psychic, and Zeo Zag&#257;to and adds characterization, two trial teams, several bit-beasts, and a minor subplot for Kai. Meanwhile, where the manga features Volkov as Zag&#257;to's subordinate, the anime utilizes new characters Gideon, Doctor B, Doctor K, and Dan. The latter two would go on to temporarily manage a new team, the Parts Hunters, when they go rogue.</li><li> Inverted. Daichi's long-running arc before meeting Tyson is not included in the anime. As a result, he comes across as a pesky ball of arrogance rather than someone who worked hard to achieve what he did.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>: Team Psychic starts out real-evil in the manga instead of becoming possessed-evil as it does in the anime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJobChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJobChange">Adaptational Job Change</a>:<ul><li> Tyson is the BBA Team's captain in the original version, as it was he that won the Japanese Tournament. In the dub, Kai is the team captain.</li><li> Jeff McKenzie goes from vice director of the PPB Research Center to director, thereby becoming Judy's peer instead of her direct subordinate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>: No doubt the manga version of S&#333;ichir&#333; Hiwatari deserves to get clobbered in the face for what he inflicts on his family as if they're his property, but he does genuinely care for Kai and, you know, he's not out to conquer the world like he is in the anime. Barthez is not a villain in the manga either, notwithstanding that it's fair to ask about his standing in the Barthez Soldats falling under the Heavy Metal System's influence. In the anime, he's an abusive, controlling creep who's in league with Volkov.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication">Adaptation Explanation Extrication</a>:<ul><li> In the manga, Kai's goal early on is to destroy as many beys as possible and the sport in general because he blames it for his father abandoning him. Hence why calling his gang "Shell Killers" makes sense. In the anime, his early goal is changed to wanting to find bit-beasts. "Shell Killers" still works for intimidation purposes, but the intended meaning has fallen out from under it.</li><li> Ever wondered why the other Shitenn&#333; call Hiruta a traitor for taking them out of the game, even though he was thrown out of the gang earlier and they were the very people who destroyed his bey? This is because in the manga, they were thrown out too after losing to Takao and it was Kai who destroyed Hiruta's bey. They understandably call him a traitor in the manga, but with their plot simplified, it makes little sense they do so in the anime.</li><li> From the same arc, if you only watch the anime, Kai taking off his gloves for his battle against Takao is weird. He takes them off, they drop to the ground the way gloves can be expected to do, and you'd think there's some sort of significance to it but nothing that can be discerned. In the manga, the Shell Killers, still loyal to Kai, hold the gloves for him and comment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">how heavy they are</a>. Ultimately, this scene would be redone correctly in the anime's third season when Kai reveals his scarf to be weighted.</li><li> The manga isn't shy to drop characters quietly, but in the case of Ivan no longer being with Borg, the manga actually provides an answer where the anime does not. He lost his team qualification match against Kai.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationRelationshipOverhaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationRelationshipOverhaul">Adaptation Relationship Overhaul</a>: There's a big one that we'll call the Volkov-Zag&#257;to tree. In the manga, Borg is a small army of bladers headed by Volkov. Borg is defeated by the combined might of the BBA, the B&aacute;i H&#468; Z&uacute;, and the All Starz. Its members go in hiding, except the four elite bladers, who break with Borg and become Neoborg. Volkov returns to the true mastermind behind Borg: Doctor Zag&#257;to, head of the Zag&#257;to Ichimi, whose true goal is to acquire the most powerful bit-beasts in existence. To this end, he hired the Saint Seals, aware they meant to betray him, but would be useful regardless. Knowing that the Saint Seals work for Zag&#257;to, Yuriy confronts them, but is defeated by Ozuma. Meanwhile, Zag&#257;to brings together a new elite quartet: Team Cyber. Both the Saint Seals and Team Cyber were defeated, after which Zag&#257;to and Volkov invest their final resources in ZO. When ZO is also defeated, Zag&#257;to turns a new leaf and Volkov is just never heard from again. In the first season of the anime, Borg is an organization that aims to take over the world by means of stealing bitbeasts. Borg is headed by Volkov, who takes orders from and whose organization is financed by S&#333;ichir&#333; Hiwatari (who in the manga wants nothing to do with beyblading). Borg is defeated during the Russian Tournament, its elite bladers break with Borg and become Neoborg, while the other bladers are implied to walk out too. Neither Volkov's nor Hiwatari's fates are given. Then comes the Zag&#257;to arc in the second season and it has no ties whatsoever with Borg. Rather, Volkov's main henchman is Gideon, who, until his death, oversees Psychic, more or less the anime name for the Zag&#257;to Ichimi. Rather than evil, the elite team of Psychic are mind-controlled into their roles. The Saint Seals never work for any branch of Zag&#257;to's organization. Zag&#257;to's goal remains to acquire the most powerful bit-beasts in existence and he eventually bets on Zeo to get them. When Zeo is defeated, Zag&#257;to turns a new leaf. Then in the third season, Volkov returns by himself and, after his henchman Barthez fails with the Barthez Soldat, sets up BEGA to gain control of beyblading. His elite team are the Justice 5, whom are confronted by Yuriy, Boris, and Sergei, but the three are readily beaten. When the Justice 5 learn what Volkov is truly like, they cut ties with BEGA. Volkov is left with nothing as BEGA ceases to exist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>:<ul><li> Any character that is introduced in the side section, that is to say, Daichi's storyline, is not included in the anime. Daichi himself is the obvious exception. His father's heroic death scene was part of the movie, but he's not so much as mentioned in the third season. Hikaru, Kennosuke, and Tenmaru get a slide in the Japan-exclusive ending of <em>G-Revolution</em>. The fake Daichi has a counterpart in J. That's about it.</li><li> Notable absences from the main storyline are Mister B and Ken Daiba, both core members of the BBA in the manga. In Mister B's case, what appears to have happened is that both he and his partner Hitoshi were omitted from the first season. By the time of the third season's development, Mister B had already been phased out of the manga, but Hitoshi had been upgraded to Takao's coach. So, Hitoshi was included finally during the third season, but not Mister B. Ken Daiba, meanwhile, is the last character introduced in the manga and all he really does is bring in the heavy metal system. All in all, it's his arc that ends the manga and it's the BEGA arc that ends the anime.</li><li> Zigzagged with Kai's parents. With S&#333;ichir&#333;'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> upgrade for the first season, it seems Kai's parents aren't alive anymore. They'd hopefully have objected to Kai being raised as a weapon for his grandfather's plans of world domination if they were still breathing. But there is a line in the Japanese version of S2E5 where his father is mentioned as still being in Kai's life, just that their relationship is horribly strained. In the manga, Kai's mother barely qualifies as a character, but she takes care of him, while Kai's father more or less walked out on them for the sake of beyblading.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyChangedDubName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyChangedDubName">Barely Changed Dub Name</a>:<ul><li> The English dub usually opted for names that have the same first letter as the Japanese names (such as changing "Takao" to "Tyson"). Rei Kon however just became Raymond "Ray" Kon.</li><li> The Italian dub changed Max's surname from "Mizuhara" to "Mizihara".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a>: In terms of beyblade teams, the anime adds Team Who, the Team Psychic mooks, the Parts Hunters, the Children of the Four Holy Beasts of Darkness, and the Justice 5. Then there's various individuals, whether good or bad, like Akira, Hiromi, Alan, Gideon, and Doctor K. The dub jumps even further and adds three more characters in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice">The Voice</a>. Primarily Dizzi, Ky&#333;ju's talking bit-beast that resides inside his computer. The two bey-battle commentators Brad Best and AJ Topper are also exclusive to the dub.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">Dub-Induced Plot Hole</a>:<ul><li> In the original version, the Majestic 4 do not have a name. They're simply the Euro Team. The dub gave them the name Majestics. However, the story as it is has the members form a team for the first time, which specifically occurs in S1E38. A.J. Topper and Brad Best introduce them as the Majestics, which Ralf is surprised by and Johnny indifferent to, while Olivier and Giancarlo talk about how beyblading is not a team sport. Which leaves the question just who came up with "Majestics"? There's some implication Johnny created the name, but that would be at odds with him being the one insistently opposed to what's going on in the first place.</li><li> The big one is Hiromi's inability to see bit-beasts at the start of the second season. In the Japanese canon, the ability to see bit-beasts is rare. In the dub, at least during the first season, everyone can see them. Then in comes Hiromi with a few episodes worth of "I want to see bit-beasts too!". The dub went with it, opting to forgo addressing the established dub canon. Which caused <em>another</em> problem in regards to the dub-exclusive Dizzi. She's a bit-beast, yet during all Hiromi's asking, Dizzi's identity is somehow ignored. This is exceptionally blatant in S2E11 when Hiromi asks Dizzi if she could tell her what a bit-beast is (and is ignored because there are more pressing matters at hand).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>: So many...<ul><li> Almost every character gets a name change. In most cases, the change turns a non-American name into an American name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalizedNameInANonLocalizedSetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalizedNameInANonLocalizedSetting">even when there's no pretense that the character is American</a>. In other cases, a non-American name is changed into another non-American name that's more recognizable to an American audience.</li><li> Kai's trading card makes mention of the Shell Sharks, a weird in-between of "Shell Killers" and "Blade Sharks" that suggests the team's name was changed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">avoid the "killer" part</a>.</li><li> A confusing part of the Japanese version of the anime is that a bit-beast and a bey may or may not have the same name. Most are referred to by the same name, but there are bladers who address their bit-beasts differently, namely by their "species" name. These include the BBA's bit-beasts (Seiry&#363;, Suzaku, Byakko, Genbu, K&#333;ry&#363;), Giancarlo's bit-beast (Amphisbaena), the Team Psychic's test bit-beasts (Digital Dragon, Digital Bird), and at least two of the Team Zag&#257;to's bit-beasts (Spider, Kamaitachi). On top of that, a bit-beast with a separate name can be addressed by the bey's name, but the reverse is not possible. The anime technically inherited this from the manga, but it was less in-your-face there because there were less bit-beasts. The dub team apparently had issues with it too and renamed the affected bit-beasts to have the same name as the bey.</li><li> The second season. It received the additional title "2002" in Japan because it aired in 2002. But it didn't air in 2002 elsewhere. The English dub changed "2002" to "V-Force" and most translations followed suit. For the third season, Japan got the hint and gave it the more versatile addition title "G-Revolution".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>: One episode of the first season got named "Last Tangle In Paris" in the dub. Not a kid-friendly reference.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalizedNameInANonLocalizedSetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalizedNameInANonLocalizedSetting">Localized Name in a Non-Localized Setting</a>: Aside from the above Japanese-to-English dub changes, there's actually one example present in the Japanese version of Season 1. In the manga, the Chinese team is called "B&aacute;i H&#468; Z&uacute;", "B&aacute;i H&#468;" being "(the) White Tiger" and "Z&uacute;" being "clan". In the anime, the team is renamed "Byakko Zoku", which is exactly the same name but in Japanese. The clan's home country isn't changed. In Season 3, they go by "B&aacute;i H&#468; Z&uacute;" once more.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedByTheAdaptation">Named by the Adaptation</a>: Two cases.<ul><li> The manga gives less characters a name than the anime, and the original version of the anime gives less characters a name than the dub. For instance, Nobuo is nameless in the manga, and Bianca and Rosetta are nameless in the original version of the anime.</li><li> In the early part of the franchise, teams technically don't have names. They are referred to either by nation or by organization. The anime was produced with the same setup, but for the localization proper and separate team names were created. This in turn influenced the Japanese franchise to also introduce team names.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a>:<ul><li> Poorly done in the dub in regards to Rei's and Mao's relationship. All scenes and dialogue regarding their romance are removed or replaced to assure the audience that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend">BFFs</a>. The icing is that the dub doesn't change Rei's and Rai's relation, so Rei ends up restoring bestie status with Rai too.</li><li> There was only so much the dub could remove from Giancarlo's interaction with Bianca and Rosetta to try and make it look platonic, and ultimately it threw in the towel and went with romantic. Next episode though, the dub has the gall to let Olivier refer to the girls as Giancarlo's "friends".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSmoking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSmoking">No Smoking</a>: During the briefing between Douglas and Judy in S1E26, Douglas starts smoking once the topic turns to the BBA in the original version. In the dub, all shots of him with a cigarette are removed. As a result, the briefing in the dub is about half the length of the original version.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelatedInTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelatedInTheAdaptation">Related in the Adaptation</a>: Several characters are related in the dub when they weren't in the original. The B&aacute;i H&#468; Z&uacute; Elder becomes Rai's and Mao's grandfather in the dub. Blood and Howling become brothers. King and Queen also become siblings, but in their case it's possible they were meant as siblings in the original too.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrelatedInTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrelatedInTheAdaptation">Unrelated in the Adaptation</a>: Genta and Ganta are no longer specified as being brothers in the dub. Just like in the manga, Takao and Daichi aren't cousins anymore (and by extension Yoshie and Rinko aren't sisters).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a>: Hangs around in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> area for the shift from Season 1 to Season 2. Whereas the manga is continuous, the second and third season were done by a different company than the first. Some of the things Season 2 did against Season 1 expectations are:<ul><li> In the original version of S2E7, Hiromi believes Kai to be a spy for an organization that wants to take over the world. She's wrong then, but it is what Kai was raised to be before going in a healthier direction. You'd expect Ky&#333;ju to tell her not to bring it up, but no. The dub fixes this flub by omitting the specifics of her accusation and adding a line for Ky&#333;ju where he acknowledges that Kai went evil in Russia once.</li><li> In S2E28, the BBA Team returns to New York on Judy's invitation and get a tour through the PPB facility. Everything references the American tournament arc of the first season except that not a peep is spent on the All Starz. Not even an offhand remark that they're off training somewhere else or visiting their families! The original version is worse in this matter than the dub because at least the dub states that the facility they visit is different from the one where the All Starz trained in the first season, while the original version implies it's the same building.</li><li> In S2E30, Rei is on the verge of being beaten by Foxy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerSpin">Doppelg&auml;nger Spin</a>. Rei is familiar with Kiki pulling that same stunt and didn't drop a sweat when Paula went with it. He's literally the one BBA'er who should be as good as immune to an attack like that.</li><li> Even worse is S2E35, in which the opponent has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">kamaitachi</a>-type bit-beast. None of the BBA Team can figure out how the beyblade and/or bit-beast can attack without hitting Kai's beyblade at first, and it's Rei of all people who utters the line that it can't be the wind doing the damage. Yes, that Rei, the one who nearly got murdered in S1E49 by Boris's Falborg's knife-like wind-based attacks.</li><li> The final part of the second season features a World Tournament again. It's in name only, though, as there's nothing "world" about it. It's exclusively the teams that appeared prior in Season 2, most of which members are Japanese or Chinese. The grand exception is the Central American duo, which are such awful stereotypes you just know they were only thrown in to give some pretense of "world". Nobody takes them seriously and they are defeated promptly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Spared by the Adaptation</a>: Y&#363;ya's fate after using the cyber bit-beast in the original is ambiguous, which among others makes it a possibility he perished. The dub removes this possibility by stating he "was never the same again".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou">You Don't Look Like You</a>: The Brazilian Team in the anime is little like the Brazilian team in the manga. The points of resemblance are clear enough, but the anime diversified the group by a lot.</li></ul><p></p><h2><em>Bakuten Shoot Beyblade</em> also contains examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects">2D Visuals, 3D Effects</a>: Starting with the second season, the beyblades were animated in CGI, while the rest of the show remained drawn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedWarehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedWarehouse">Abandoned Warehouse</a>: The hideouts of the Shell Killers in Season 1 and the Saint Seals in Season 2. The manga specifies that the Shell Killers' hideout belongs to Kai's family's company, but this is not stated in the anime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcronymAndAbbreviationOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcronymAndAbbreviationOverload">Acronym and Abbreviation Overload</a>: There's a number of acronyms that are easy enough to remember what they refer to, but the full name or term is mentioned maybe once or twice. So to sum it up:<ul><li> Organizations: GBC - Great Beyblade Cup; BBA - Beyblade Battle Associaton; PPB - Project Power of Beyblade; BEGA - Beyblade Entertainment Global Association; ABK - Akebo Blader Kids; F-Sangre - Fernandez Sangre</li><li> Mister B, Doctor B, Doctor K, and J are only known by their initials.

Not exactly the least of names. "Driger" was originally said as "Drai-ger", but was changed to "Drih-ger". "Draciel" was originally pronounced as "Dra-shell", but was changed to "Dra-seal".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphabeticalThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphabeticalThemeNaming">Alphabetical Theme Naming</a>: A major name system in Season 1, but absent in Seasons 2 and 3.<ul><li> <strong>Dra</strong>goon, <strong>Dra</strong>nzer, <strong>Dra</strong>ciel, and <strong>Dr[a]</strong>iger.</li><li> <strong>Gal</strong>uon, <strong>Gal</strong>zy, <strong>Gal</strong>man, and <strong>Gal</strong>ux.</li><li> Canari<strong>as</strong>, Pirani<strong>as</strong>, and Sam<strong>as</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Try</strong>gle, <strong>Try</strong>pio, <strong>Try</strong>horn, and <strong>Try</strong>gator.</li><li> Either Dracu<strong>os</strong>, Wolf<strong>os</strong>, Bande<strong>os</strong>, and Franke<strong>os</strong> (original) or Dracu<strong>lo</strong>r, Lycan<strong>lo</strong>r, Sarcopha<strong>lo</strong>n, and Shamb<strong>lo</strong>r (dub).</li><li> Griffo<strong>lyon</strong>, Salama<strong>lyon</strong>, and Amphy<strong>lyon</strong> and Unico<strong>lyon</strong>.</li><li> Wol<strong>borg</strong>, Sea<strong>borg</strong>, Fal<strong>borg</strong>, and Wy<strong>borg</strong>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: Combines with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents">Invisible Parents</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoAdults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoAdults">There Are No Adults</a> on a case by case basis. There are only some 20-30 adults in the entire franchise, of which a significant portion true villains (as opposed to all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> child villains). The rest are family, who are generally useless, or people involved with beyblade, who are generally useful. Of the main cast, Rei never gets so much as a mention he even has parents, and the rest have parents that don't actually seem to be too concerned about them. A notable instance is S2E11, which sees the BBBA Team saved from an island fully controlled by Team Psychic. The only "parent" to pick them up? Takao's grandfather.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a>:<ul><li> The English dub and international dubs based on it have a different opening theme song. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if8YvZG800c&amp;feature=related">"LET'S BEYBLADE!"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> The Italian dub used the original Japanese version as the basis for translation and thus retains the original BGM. However, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08oB86uPQSk">it still uses an original theme song.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">Ambiguous Gender</a>: Bit-beasts waver between being outright genderless and just never having their gender specified. The exceptions in the anime are Dragoon and Driger, who are male, and Wolborg and Galux, who are female. The dub generally claims that all bit-beasts are male, with the obvious exception of Dizzi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">Analogy Backfire</a>: For the better, in the original version. In the first season Ralf views beybattles as spiritual successors to the life-or-death duels his ancestors engaged in. As such, he only ever battles an opponent once, because after that they're "dead". Despite that Ralf already defeated Takao once, he ends up agreeing to join forces with his fellow European champions in an exhibition match against the BBA because an exhibition match "doesn't count". The Majestic 4 gets massively defeated during said match, which not only knocks some humility into them but also forces them to reflect on their attitudes to other bladers and to their own bit-beasts. Then steps in Team WHO, who've also underwent a change of heart after seeing the BBA care about their bit-beasts, but still demand retribution from the Majestic 4. Ralf assents, which prompts Team WHO to stand down and Blood to reply that Ralf's old self already has died and that that's enough, thereby redefining the "death" that comes from losing a beybattle as a "rebirth".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalBattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalBattleAura">Animal Battle Aura</a>: This is how the bit-beasts are often portrayed during especially dramatic battle sequences. The beybladers themselves are also commonly portrayed with their respective bit-beasts as their battle aura.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl">Anime Chinese Girl</a>: Mao and Ming-Ming are prime examples of the trope.

Just like the manga ends without saying who, between Takao, Kai, Daichi, and Yuriy, wins, the anime doesn't reveal who emerges victorious from the beybattle between Takao and Brooklyn. The official Japanese website, however, states that Takao won.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">Armor-Piercing Slap</a>: There are a few, but of course they've all been edited out for the international version.<ul><li> Ky&#333;ju slaps Giancarlo in S1E35 for not having proper control of Amphilyon, which resulted in the bit-beast attacking Takao and causing massive destruction.</li><li> In S2E35, Dan tries to encourage Doctor K to continue her work and to not let that day's failure bring her down.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a> from <em>V-Force</em> to <em>G-Revolution</em> was more subtle, and the characters looked their age once again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">Back for the Finale</a>: Done at the end of the first season, when literally every blader Tyson and the BBA ever met cheers Tyson on during his match against Yuriy.

There are two teams of which the members form a band: the Central American champions in <em>V-Force</em> and the Ming Ming Band in <em>G-Revolution</em>. Both employ their instruments during battle. Of course, their opponents aren't bands, but they do have to follow along with the rhythm if they want to win.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops">Battle Tops</a>: The premise of the show.

To put it simple, anyone without a bit-beast, which are rare (and in many cases inherited), has no chance against someone who does, regardless of skill.<ul><li> Team WHO seems to have been added to the anime specifically to address the matter in-universe. The imbalance doesn't get solved, but bit-beast ownership is emphasized as a matter of responsibility.</li><li> Becomes utterly ridiculous in <em>V-Force</em> when the BBA calls the cyber bit-beasts illegal modifications. Exactly how are they more illegal than "natural" bit-beasts, which most people can't even see and thus don't know about?</li><li> There's an implication that of all bit-beasts, the ones wielded by the BBA Team are the strongest.

The horror movie the BBA watches while on the train help them figure out the weaknesses to Blood's and Howling's vampire and werewolf bit-beasts. As well, Rei happens to find a silver coin that someone left behind on the train, which he uses to augment Driger with silver to take down the werewolf bit-beast.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a>: Hiromi is the only female on the main team.

Enough so that it's easier to list the ones that don't fit the definition. The trope-high hitters are Kai, Borg, the Barthez Soldats, and the Justice 5. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> is taken into account, the Children of the Four Holy Beasts of Darkness can be listed too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>:<ul><li> In Season 1 and 2 of the dub, Ky&#333;ju has a bit-beast, Dizzi, who is trapped inside his computer.

For Ivan, no explanation is given in either the original version of the series or the dub, though he's shown back with his team in the Japan-exclusive slideshow ending. (The manga explains Kai beat him for a spot on the team.) For Steve, the Japan-exclusive slideshow ending shows he's been in the hospital all this time.

They say they were turned into monsters after losing to the European champions, but there doesn't appear to be any consequences to that in the dub. The sold their souls in the original, true, but what that entails is not dwelled upon.

He cannot have died in Kai's arms because Kai envisions him later in hospital clothes, which only makes sense if he'd actually been brought to a hospital for a longer stay. However, it is the last time Y&#363;ya actually appears in the show and in the original version is the last time he's confirmed to have been conscious.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>:<ul><li> There is a somewhat odd example near the end of season 1. Rei's bit-beast Driger apparently sacrifices itself in order to save Rei's life. According to Kai, while Driger was able to protect Rei from taking further damage from Falborg's wind attacks, the attack was too much for Driger, which caused it to disappear after the fight. Near the end of the season finale, it is shown that Driger has returned to Rei.</li><li> Similarly, in <em>G-Revolution</em>, Dranzer's bit-chip shatters and you hear it cry and yet come the epilogue, here it is again. Then again, Dranzer is a phoenix, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">an animal depicted to be reborn from it's own ashes</a>...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivingSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivingSave">Diving Save</a>: Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TuckAndCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TuckAndCover">Tuck and Cover</a>. In S2E10, Hiromi and Ky&#333;ju are in the path of a rock slide and too caught off-guard to move out of the way in time.

To this end, he goes to a bar where he orders milk on the rocks, much to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFault">disbelief</a> of the other patrons. Him ordering milk is both a gag because it contrasts with the trenchcoat-and-hat badass way he enters the bar, but it also is a gag because the whole atmosphere doesn't fit Ky&#333;ju to begin with. He's a nerd, somewhat prone to stress, and shy and polite. Of course he'd order milk!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullEyesOfUnhappiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullEyesOfUnhappiness">Dull Eyes of Unhappiness</a>: After being defeated by Brooklyn, Kai is seen aimlessly walking around and slouched on the ground of an alley with these.

Needless to say, Kai singlehandedly defeats them both.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial">Fastball Special</a>: In S2E47, Takao's and King's solution to get rid of Dr. K's interference with their match is to have Dragoon throw Ariel at her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">Females Are More Innocent</a>: Of any given team that has a female member, she's near-guaranteed to be the most innocent of the team. Emily is the only one of hers who didn't bully Max about Judy and who tried to get Judy to admit to some love for her son. Mariam was the first of hers who objected to bit-beasts being hurt and who opened up to the BBA. Salima was the only one able to resist the cyber bit-beasts and refused to abandon her team even if they might hurt her in their state. Similarly, Mathilda was pivotal in getting her team out of Barthez's influence. The only archetype that forms any competition to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGirl">Token Girl</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>, which Mao and Gaoh showcase.

Some wear them all the time, others, like Max and Ky&#333;ju, wear them when blading. Sometimes, the gloves aren't fingerless (or partially fingerless: Max's gloves in season 2-3 still cover his ring and pinky fingers) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandwrapsOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandwrapsOfAwesome">Handwraps of Awesome</a> is in effect. The look is more prominent in the last two seasons than in the first one.

But the second season, movie included, in particular has a problem not investing in its cast. It brings back Daitenji and Judy, but makes them doormats compared to their Season 1 selves. It fills up the episode count with several one-shot evil bladers with near no defining traits and certainly no audience investment. Despite that Gordo holds the position of a character that should have a story, he's really only there so Zeo has the partner required for a tag team tournament. Then there are the children that get possessed by the Four Holy Beasts of Darkness... at the end of the movie there's more to say about their caretaker than about them and the bit-beasts combined!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALadyOnEachArm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALadyOnEachArm">A Lady on Each Arm</a>: Giancarlo's ability to manage two girlfriends on the surface is just a show of his playboy-ism, but it's also a first glimpse towards him handling a two-headed bit-beast and utilizing a strategy that involves "doubling" his bey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceOfSpades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceOfSpades">Ace of Spades</a>: In S1E38, Ralf draws this card.

Luckily, Ry&#363;nosuke hasn't and whips him up a party. This is a departure from the original, in which the party being thrown is a pre-battle encouragement attempt. Plus, Takao is ten.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a>: The protagonists' bit-beasts are Genbu (Draciel), Suzaku (Dranzer), Byakko (Driger), and Seiry&#363; (Dragoon).

Spirits and the like exist in the form of Bit-beasts and whatever gave the Dark Bladers their bit-beasts. Many if not most bit-beasts are inherited and while they can come under another's control, they do have a preference to stick with one bloodline or meritline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a>: Subverted.

The two most glaring ones are the Saint Seals, who were legitimate threats in their first appearances, and Yuriy, who fought Takao for the World Championship at the end of the first season. Then he returned in Season 3, and was demoted to Kai's second banana.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaHaHaNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaHaHaNo">HA HA HA&#151;No</a>: In S2E32, Zeo drags Takao to the Aoki River and only there tells him he needs him for a beybattle.

In S2E4, Takao is forced to race across the city on threat that Ky&#333;ju and Hiromi will be killed. To make one of the deadlines, he takes Keiko's bike (and her dinner ingredients still in the basket). He gets into a traffic accident that may or may not have wrecked the bike. In S2E28, he takes a bike to go after the people who stole the tablet from the PPB. It's not said whom it belongs to, but is implied to be a police agent's, possibly Scott's.

The island then ends up sinking, ensuring the bit-beasts will never be set free again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>: Kai prefers to keep to himself, but he's only just joined the BBA when he's already showing signs of a protective streak, especially towards Max. As well, in S1E21, he's willing to train Antonio in part because his determination reminds him of Takao's.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>: Strangely, it's the second season with the cutesy art style that does this.<ul><li> Dr B. in the second season gets accidentally killed in a fit of insanity. The death itself is offscreen but the implication is clear.</li><li> As much as nothing is said about it, no way that there weren't <em>many</em> deaths at the hands of the Shadow Bladers in the movie. For instance, one scene has a positively packed mass of civilians marching through the main street to evacuate when they are hit in full by a tsunami. Another scene has the entire city on fire.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a>: Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> nature of <em>Beyblade</em>, every once in a while the geniuses of the story come up with the new evolution in beyblading. The systems of the first generation are the Spin Gear System (4-Layer &amp; 5-Layer), the Magnacore System, the Engine Gear System, and the Hard Metal System. The Spin Gear System was present from the start and got its importance sidelined in favor of bit-beasts. The Magnacore System was introduced in <em>V-Force</em>. In S2E6, Doctor B develops the Magtram to give Team Psykick an edge. They hadn't counted on Ky&#333;ju recording Snakey's battle against Takao and analyzing the tech used by the former. Ky&#333;ju then joined forces with Judy and the PPB for the development of the Magnacore. The Engine Gear System and the Hard Metal System were introduced in <em>G-Revolution</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGirlDarkBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGirlDarkBoy">Light Girl, Dark Boy</a>: With the sole exception of Ming-Ming, every girl in the anime is either light-skinned, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">becomes light-skinned</a>, or has a lighter skin tone than a related male character. Mao started off with the same skin tone as her teammates, but became paler than them, including her brother, in <em>G-Revolution</em>. Paula is the only member of Spintensity noted to have native ties, yet she's also the only one with light skin. This stands out even more when one considers her unnamed manga counterpart has the same dark skin as her teammates. The difference between Mariam's and Yusuf's skintones is small, but still lighter on Mariam's side. Between King and Queen, Queen is the one with light skin while King has dark skin. Moses's younger sister is also nowhere near his level of melanin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">Limited Wardrobe</a>: The cast generally sticks with one outfit per season, which you can consider either played straight or averted. Alternative outfits do incidentally show up for specific occasions, like nightwear, training outfits, and in the case of Team Psychic uniforms vs casual clothes. Ming-Ming, Hiromi, and Hitoshi stand out for wearing a few different outfits throughout <em>G-Revolution</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>: There are many beyblade teams &mdash; enough teams to warrant three tournament arcs in the series &mdash; which numbers can range from two to six members.

The worst of the second season is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlinessUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlinessUpgrade">Girliness Upgrade</a> of Judy and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> second outfit of Doctor K, but at least these are still adult women. In the third season, even the ten-something year olds aren't safe. Among others, Mathilda and Ming-Ming have a squeeze-boobs-up-between-arms part in their more elaborate attack sequences, there's the "Egyptian" dresses Hiromi and Julia wear for a single shot in S3E18, and odd bits here and there like a focus shot of Hiromi's torso while she's running in S3E51. Needless to say, where they could the dub team removed these parts.

The GBC title essentially reused sprites from earlier games produced by Hudson Soft, some of which humanoid, that arguably don't count, but it also featured Saiz&#333;, Hitoshi's ninja bit-beast, that was one of Takara's designs. For the manga, the Rokumendo bit-beasts were omitted and Hitoshi's bit-beast was replaced by metal versions of the BBA Team's bit-beasts. Then the anime created Team WHO, of whom bit-beasts Dracuos and Frankeos returned the concept of humanoid bit-beasts.

Egypt is located in Africa, not Europe.</li><li> In Aoki's notes, Team Psychic's members are said to have been scouted from all over the world. Kane is Japanese-Australian and G&#333;ki is full Japanese. Salima and Jim were not designed with a particular background in mind, though Salima's name was taken from an African travel guide while her nationality in the anime is Canadian, and Jim's name suggests him to be either American or European.</li><li> The Barthez Soldats are a European team. Michael is named after an F1-racer, which is also how the Majestic 4 got their names. Therefore, Michael would be German. Aaron is Jamaican, but it can go either way whether his deal is like Rei's or Max's. Mathilda is from the United Kingdom since <em>Rising</em>, and Claude's name suggests he's from a (partially) French-speaking country. The French name suggests they might battle specifically on behalf of France.</li><li> The BEGA Team features Garland, Ming-Ming, Mystel, Moses, and Brooklyn. Garland's appearance suggests South Asian roots, Ming-Ming seems to be Chinese, Mystel is Indonesian according to Aoki's notes, and Moses would have to be from somewhere in Africa.

Customized launchers that give an advantage but still depend on the skill and strength of the user, like Paula's fishing rod launcher or Emily's tennis launcher, could still be part of a fair match, but guns like Borg or Psychic use? Not so much, and just like with bit-beast ownership, the fiction works to avoid the subject. In fairness, the aforementioned teams are depicted as evil, but the launchers themselves are legal and they keep them even after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMoreHoldingBackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMoreHoldingBackSpeech">"No More Holding Back" Speech</a>: This from Kai's second battle against Brooklyn in the dub:<div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsInigoMontoya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsInigoMontoya">Kai.

The original four, anyway; Gaia Dragoon's status is somewhat ambiguous. This is particularly clear from Zag&#257;to's insistence he has to have those bit-beasts even when he's full of praise for the bit-beasts he already has.

Throughout the American tournament arc, Judy gives Emily the affection she withholds from Max and Max outright wonders if that is because Emily easily beat him in a sample match.

That is, the PPB's science is presented negatively to the BBA's hard work and good spirits go at beyblading. It is presented positively when Takao needs the backup to have a chance against Yuriy.

Lampshaded by Brooklyn to Kai, who on several occasions made remarks about how serious Kai was about the game. Also lampshaded in the German <em>Beyblade</em> opening, were a line in the lyrics essentially is "The whole world revolves around Beyblade". This aspect of the series is actually justified. At one point you do see Kai's beyblade chop down about 6 trees in one go and in another situation, he demolishes four brick pillars so you can probably imagine what it'd do to a human. Several of the blades even contain powerful bit-beasts and are covered in very sharp metal spikes, so they're much more dangerous than simple kids tops.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>: The entirety of S1E16 was this for Rei and Mao, even more blatantly in the original than in the dub.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoePhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoePhone">Shoe Phone</a>: As the series goes on, it introduces more and more ludicrous ways to launch a Beyblade. Hell, halfway through the first season, we see the All Starz using various sport applications to launch. Including a baseball (which splits apart) and one on a tennis racket. That last one actually makes sense given the dubious physics used, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">all of which were thrown out the window for the second half of ''G-Revolution''</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">in favour of pure awesome.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShorterMeansSmarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShorterMeansSmarter">Shorter Means Smarter</a>: In effect for Ky&#333;ju of the BBA (at least prior to Daichi joining), Emily of the PPB All Starz, both of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShortGuyWithGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShortGuyWithGlasses">The Short Guy with Glasses</a>, Jim of Team Psychic, and counting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSneakyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSneakyGuy">The Sneaky Guy</a>, Kiki of the B&aacute;i H&#468; Z&uacute; and Yusuf of the Saint Seals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow">Shouldn't We Be in School Right Now?</a>: Some 90% of the cast are teens and preteens, yet there are only two times, three if we stretch it, their current education is addressed. After not going to school for the whole of Season 1, Season 2 starts with Tyson and Ky&#333;ju in school, and Hiromi is introduced to the main cast on account of being their classmate. Kai is later revealed to be off to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchool">Boarding School</a>, which introduces his classmate Y&#363;ya for a plotline later on. It all lasts for 12 episodes, and then no one goes to school anymore. Another mention occurs in the first season regarding Giancarlo, who is introduced while sneaking away from his private lessons about to start. Similarly, Zeo in the second season is shown to get violin lessons from his valet, which opens the possibility he gets private lessons in other subjects too. Then there are various characters for whom it's not hard to theorize how their education works, but that's only theorizing and still leaves plenty of character that just... don't seem to get an education at all. Since then, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakutenShootBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakutenShootBeyblade">Rising</a></em> has addressed these issues too, but just as ambiguously. In the fifth chapter, Daichi has been made to study harder by his mother because his grades have been slipping. Needless to say, he's never been shown to go to school before, but here he gets a private tutor in the form of Hitoshi. Ky&#333;ju speaks of preparing for his high school entrance exams in the second special chapter, which is a new kind of concern of his.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization">Tuckerization</a>: In the original version of S1E1, Hiruta tells Tyson and the others to meet him at the Aoki River, a reference to the mangaka Takao Aoki.</li><li> Bruce of S1E8 and S1E9 is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLeeClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLeeClone">Bruce Lee Clone</a>.</li><li> In the original version of S1E32, the horror movie the BBA watches is <em>The Devil's Bloody Miserables</em>, a heavy rewrite of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Mis&eacute;rables</a></em>.

They operate on nothing but the whims of their emotions and don't seem to be familiar with the concept of stress. In other words, the All Starz aren't able to profile them, and that unnerves them. Emily admits to the BBA that her team's glad it's the BBA that has to deal with these weirdos.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a>: Welcome to the Abbey, kids!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a>: Kai blames himself for Y&#363;ya's fate after using Digital Bird, because if he had given the boy the attention he craved from his idol, he'd never joined Team Psychic. It isn't until he gets to battle a mind-controlled G&#333;ki, who handles the completed Cyber Dranzer and mercilessly taunts Kai over Y&#363;ya's suffering, that Kai can escape his guilt cage and avenge Y&#363;ya.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>: The bit-beasts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk">The Talk</a>: Occurs in the dub of S1E1 when Tyson hopes his grandfather is not going to give him the 'birds and bees' speech, to which Ry&#363;nosuke replies that's scheduled for next week.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWereOnlyTheirScouts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWereOnlyTheirScouts">Those Were Only Their Scouts</a>: Pulled a lot. A-LOT! In Season 1, there's Bruce for the B&aacute;i H&#468; Z&uacute;, Andy &amp; Tony for the PPB All Starz, and Alexander for Borg. In summary, almost every core team has a scout in the first season. In Season 2, half the bladers the BBA Team has to fight are scouts. That is to say, there's twelve scouts, split in two groups that precede Team Psychic and Team Zag&#257;to, while the amount of non-scouts in Season 2 is fourteen. The third season has the Ming-Ming Band and the BEGA Training Squad for the Justice 5. The Barthez Soldat have this function in relation to the Justice 5 too, but only because they themselves chose not to be the true danger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">Thousand-Yard Stare</a>: Kai after losing to Brooklyn.

Which, somewhat surprisingly, works. The shots of the glove being thrown are missing in the dub, so the trope doesn't apply there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>: Most of the series, with the exception of a bulk of the second season.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">Tragic Dream</a>: Zag&#257;to's and Zeo's shared dream of the latter becoming flesh and blood instead of nuts and bolts. Even if they had succeeded in capturing all four sacred bit-beasts there was no guarantee they'd actually be able to make the boy human.

But he was too young, around 7 or so, to control the bey and beast. The resulting experience caused either emotional trauma or physical trauma and it wasn't until he returned to Borg's abbey at the age of 10 that he got that part of his childhood back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnCoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnCoat">Turn Coat</a>: Kai wears the crown that comes with this trope. Over three seasons, he switches sides a grand total of <em>six</em> times. He's allied with the Shell Killers, the BBA Team, Borg, the BBA Team again, then Borg again, then BEGA, then the BBA Team once more.

Takao carries him the rest of the way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">Warrior Therapist</a>: It seems like this series is ripe with both kinds of this trope. Apparently, no matter how many battles you've won in the past, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">all it takes to get you doubting yourself is a well-timed comment</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: The background of Zag&#257;to's and Daitenji's lost friendship is that 30 years ago they got their hands on a tablet containing bit-beasts. Then Zag&#257;to stole it and disappeared. The two cross paths again when Zag&#257;to has another such tablet stolen. For the rest of the season, bit-beasts are extracted from this second tablet, but the fate of the first tablet after its theft is never touched upon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> In S1E16, Mao is not appreciative of Rei letting their history cloud his judgment during their battle in the Asian Tournament Finals, despite it working in her favor. She makes sure to call him out for fighting "like such a coward" and forces him to take the match seriously.</li><li> In S2E20, Tyson gets this from Hiromi for yelling at Ky&#333;ju all because he was trying to help and he gets this from Max too after he yelled at Hiromi. He also gets this from Rei and Kai to an extent, when they accuse Takao of cheating.</li><li> In S3E13, Tyson gets this from Hiromi, Ky&#333;ju, and his own brother Hitoshi when he blames his loss on Daichi.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>: The bit-beasts waver between being treated as living, sapient beings and as tools. It's not a matter of the good side's view or the bad side's view either, although it is sometimes played like that. Season 1 was generally considerate, spending the last two arcs on the need to respect bit-beasts, but even then Black Dranzer got the shortest end of the stick imaginable. Season 2 was not so kind. The cyber bit-beasts got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAMachine">Just a Machine</a> treatment, the shadow bit-beasts got an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> fate, and the bit-beasts taken from the sealed rock were as easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">ripped apart</a> by insufficient extraction methods as discarded with literally no one batting an eye at it or taking measures to fix the damage. All things said, a bit-beast's people-value is only consistent along the lines of who owns them. Hence the story cares about the BBA Team's bit-beasts because it cares about the BBA as bladers, but Team Zag&#257;to's bit-beast's get no cruelty protection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithOurSwordsScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithOurSwordsScene">"With Our Swords" Scene</a>: Tyson gets to be the wielder at the end of Season 3.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearsTooEarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearsTooEarly">Years Too Early</a>: In the original version of S3E5, Tyson tells Ky&#333;ju he's a 100 years to early to be his rival, which Ky&#333;ju agrees with even though Tyson's words hurt him. When at the end of the A-Block Ky&#333;ju helped Tyson win against a tricky adversary that deceived them both, Ky&#333;ju shyly asks if the 100 years have shortened to 50. Tyson apologizes for what he said and declares Ky&#333;ju his rival, no ifs or buts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: For completeness's sake, non-anime colors are included in italics.<ul><li> Blue: Tyson, Hitoshi, Kai, Suzuka, Mariam, Bat, Kane, Ming-Ming, <em>Sh&#333;go</em>, <em>Ayaka</em></li><li> Off-red: Mao, Michael (S1), Mathilda, Chiru-Chiru, <em>Kurumi</em>, <em>Emily (Bakuten Shoot Beyblade GBC 2001)</em></li><li> Purple: Rei (manga) Paula, Ralf, Volkov, Ivan, Boris (S1), Gideon, Daryl, <em>Seichi</em>, <em>Haruka</em>, <em>Mutsuki</em></li><li> Green: Kiki, Steve, Gye, Olivier, Yusuf, Zeo, Claude, Izam, Ming-Ming's bassist, <em>Kaoru</em>, <em>Makoto</em>, <em>Mutsuki</em></li></ul></li></ul><hr>
