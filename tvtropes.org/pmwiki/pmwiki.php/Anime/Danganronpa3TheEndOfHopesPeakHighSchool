It has a very fancy campus, its students are allowed a lot of freedom and practically guaranteed success upon leaving school, and it's renowned across the world. In reality, the teachers really don't care about education, the whole school is a glorified laboratory for research on talent, they treat their Ultimate students like performing animals, and the whole thing is bankrolled by the badly-treated Reserve Students, who are inadvertently providing plenty of data on what happens when your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a> is allowed to rampage unchecked.

Both feature the victim surrounded by other students as Junko looks down and mocks them. Her bullying of Juzo is cruelly, uncomfortably close to a brutal form of school bullying: not only does she out him as a closeted homosexual, she also stomps on him and humiliates him, with a lot of students laughing at him when she reveals the object of his affection.

But the ending shows that those Izuru powers were critical to saving everyone, sabotaging the "you're good enough as you are!" moral. The return of classical Hajime's personality <em>was</em> a key factor in his decision to stop Mitarai (Izuru would be too apathetic to bother)... but everyone in the final episode is awed by "Kamukura's" talents than "Hajime's" decency, courage and people skills, and largely ignore the abuses that led to him <em>having</em> that talent. This is understandably justified for some reason, since both Hajime AND Izuru are the same person through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">Split-Personality Merge</a>.</li><li> Though they treat it as <em>their</em> atonement, the Remnants taking the fall for Tengan ironically also undermines the series' theme about taking responsibility for your actions and dealing with the consequences. Tengan may be dead, but no doubt there were others who are no better him in the FF.</li><li> The dangers of elitism and hubris, another moral mainstay of the series, also get slightly dented &mdash; the corrupt committee and immoral scientists who used Hajime as a lab rat technically succeeded in "creating hope" (even if it did bring about the Tragedy first and require a Hajime/Izuru merge), and the reputation of Hope's Peak and the Future Foundation goes largely untarnished because the Remnants took the fall... so the people who <em>did</em> atone for their sins (who were really victims, not villains, in the first place) are shunned by the world for life, while the two institutions that started all the chaos in the first place retain their status. Given the fact that Junko is involved with the Tragedy and Class 77-B has too much emotional guilt from that event, it's understandable to some extent.</li><li> The danger of cover up and shady dealings got thrown out of the window by having the Tragedy resolved by a cover up.</li><li> The idea of moving on from tragedy, an idea hovering over the entire series, is tarnished considerably since Kirigiri's revival means that Naegi ends up the same as he was at the start of <em>Danganronpa 3</em> (barring a few more therapy bills). The deaths in the killing game sadden him, but he doesn't seem to be close enough to the newly introduced characters to be especially scarred by their demise. To be fair though, this is mainly due to Makoto and the surviving Class 78 students joining the Future Foundation two or three years ago and they're too busy cleaning up the mess Junko made. The only surviving character who actually lost anyone close to them is Munakata, who loses <em>everyone.</em> He's shown as miserable and ends up the only one without a happy ending.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>: The title of <em>Side:Hope</em>'s single episode is "The Academy of Hope and the High School Students of Despair", the subtitle for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a>'s Japanese release.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>: Class 77 seems to have gone through this.

Meanwhile, the former Remnants of Despair, while all alive and cured from the effects of Junko's Brainwashing Despair Video, are unlikely to be able to return to society ever again, due to their actions as Junko's lackeys and the fact that they helped to cover up the Final Killing Game, and due to the fact that Mitarai is now associating himself with them, he's in the same boat (literally). But even then, as former leads of their own game, Class 77-B get their own happy ending in the fact that now they get to live together on an island paradise for as long as they want together as the close friends who bonded so well together thanks to Chisa and Chiaki. Munakata gets it way worse, going off to do who knows what all alone, with the knowledge that the woman he loved was a member of the movement he hated so much, and that his best friend's death is partially his fault. And everyone else is dead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseCerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseCerebusSyndrome">Reverse Cerebus Syndrome</a>: Making a parallel to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> of Hope's Peak Saga. The episode begins with the main characters surounded and outnumbered by a mind-controlled army, while Mitarai is about to brainwash mankind. Soon, Class 77-B were <em>brought back</em> by Hajime/Izuru and come to save the day. Kyoko is revealed to be alive. Mitarai is convinced by his fomer classmates to stop his plan and rejoins them. The episode ends with Hope's Peak Academy being rebuild, with Makoto Naegi as the headmaster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentScapegoat">Silent Scapegoat</a>: The SDR2 cast pretend that they're still Junko's lackeys so that Tengan's actions don't torpedo the Future Foundation's chances of restoring order.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">Split-Personality Merge</a>: Izuru and Hajime. Hajime became the dominant personality, retaining Izuru's talents. It's suggested that Izuru's personality isn't completely gone, though, as Hajime has one green eye and one red, and occasionally phrase drops Izuru's signature "boring". He also tends to be a lot more self-assured than the original Hajime and doesn't correct people when they address him as Izuru <em>or</em> Hajime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a>: After having the spotlight stolen from <em>them</em> by the FF members in <em>Side:Despair</em>, Class 77-B (plus Hajime) end up shoving <em>Side:Future</em>'s cast to the sidelines as the former Remnants clear up the Future Foundation's mess and talk down Ryota.

But on the other, all the comatose Remnants of Despair are awake, Hajime retains his personality with Izuru's talent, Mitarai is talked out of going through with his whole "hope brainwashing plan" by his former classmates, Kyoko is alive thanks to Seiko's medicine and Mikan's intervention, Hope's Peak Academy is rebuilt with Makoto as headmaster, and it's heavily implied the world manages to completely recover from the Tragedy. And depending on how you interpret it, some version of Chiaki, possibly a ghost of the original or the AI, lives within Hajime's mind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">Talking the Monster to Death</a>: Hinata and the students of Class 77-B were able to convince Mitarai not to go through with his plan to brainwash the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">Took a Level in Kindness</a>: The Remnants of Despair, as a unit.

When Ryota bewails the fact that no-one will forgive him, Hajime counters that public approval is not the point of seeking redemption &mdash; you do it so that you can live with yourself. The team go on to practice what they preach, annihilating their chances of being accepted back into society and hiding the fact that they were the ones who saved the world from Tengan and Mitarai. Rather than being hailed as heroes &mdash; or at least acknowledged as victims &mdash; the world will forever see them as the bogeymen of Junko's reign...but that's okay, since they know the truth for themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>: While the brainwashed Future Foundation agents have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> on their side, they are all easily trounced by Class 77-B.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero-Approval Gambit</a>: Class 77-B take responsibility for Kazuo's killing game in order to protect the image of the Future Foundation.
