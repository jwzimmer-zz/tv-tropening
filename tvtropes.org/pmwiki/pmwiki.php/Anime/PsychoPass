In the most extreme cases, where the Psycho-Pass is so high that rehabilitation is deemed impossible, the Sibyl System orders immediate execution.</p><p>Hunting down those deemed a threat to society is the aforementioned Public Safety Bureau, which operates through teams of two detective types: Enforcers, latent criminals whose Psycho-Pass has exceeded the acceptable level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsultingAConvictedKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsultingAConvictedKiller">but who are called on to assist</a>; and Inspectors, who supervise the Enforcers to make sure they follow procedure and don't escape. Called in on difficult and extreme cases, Bureau officers are equipped with Dominators, which allow the wielder to scan a target's Psycho-Pass and, if authorized, fire non-lethal or lethal rounds depending on the reading.

The series was picked up for simulcasting by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a>. Shortly after the anime's premiere, a manga adaptation titled <em>Inspector Akane Tsunemori</em> began serialization in Shueisha's Jump Square. It was also adapted into a two-volume novel. <em>Psycho-Pass</em> is widely considered to be the anime equivalent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport">Minority Report</a></em>, which also deals with the concept of arresting criminals before they even commit a crime based on the analysis of a central computer system.</p><p><strong>Psycho-Pass</strong> opens in 2112 as idealistic rookie Inspector Akane Tsunemori <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">begins her first assignment</a> to the Public Safety Bureau. Along with her fellow Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza, she is set to supervise the Enforcers of Division 1: Shinya Kougami, a former Inspector turned Enforcer; Tomomi Masaoka, a veteran Enforcer with deep knowledge of the Sibyl System; Shusei Kagari, a flirtatious man identified as a latent criminal at age 5; and Yayoi Kunizuka, a stoic woman of few words. Following a string of suspicious crimes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">unsolved cases</a> all leading back to the name Makishima, it's up to Akane and the Bureau to solve the conspiracy threatening society itself.

In addition, the <em>New Edit</em> adds additional footage at the beginning of each episode as well as halfway through (serving as a kind of transition scene between the two original episodes it is combining together).

The murderer has a helmet that lets him avoid detection by the drones, but it still counts since the bystanders <em>just watch the murder happen.</em> The depicted murder was probably inspired by a real one. Shingo Minamino, a music producer from Nitroplus, was stabbed multiple times and killed in the middle of the day on an extremely busy street (the assailant also killed an old woman simultaneously). Not a single person intervened, except for a woman who called the police when she saw what was happening.

This is not just a one off problem either, it occurs multiple times in the series. And when switching to a lethal mode, the gun needs a few seconds to complete its transformation sequence. Anyone who has had to fight for their life can tell you that a split second can literally mean the difference between surviving or dying. This is most apparent in episode 11, when the "Lovecraft" attack drone nearly manages to bite off Kougami's face because his Dominator was busy first registering the target as a threat, and <em>then</em> transforming and <em>then</em> charging up a shot - calmly voicing all of its actions in the meantime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a>: Shinya and Tomomi are very good at reading the criminal's mind and intent.

This continues into Season 2, as Inspector Aoyanagi is shown to keep her cool while in the middle of dealing with a brutal terrorist attack. Even outside the Public Safety Bureau, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Makishima's only female pupil, Rikako Ouryou, retains her composure almost flawlessly while her male "colleagues", Okura, Mido and Kanehara, were nervous and paranoid wrecks every second they were on screen</span>. However, this trope is zigzagged a bit when it's shown that behaving outwardly calm does not prevent either gender's Hue from clouding when they genuinely are stressed, nervous, angry, etc. even if they're doing a good job of covering it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For example, Rikako never lets her nonchalant facade slip in public, not even when the school is being investigated for her murders, but Shinya's Dominator reveals her CC to be 472, high enough to trigger Lethal Eliminator mode</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>:<ul><li> The block the criminal ran off to in the first episode has no relays (meaning the police drones can't go in there) and supposed not to be inhabited (meaning it's full of homeless people and possibly criminals). And it is pretty sizable.</li><li> Season 3 reveals that these blocks are managed by the Sibyl System where latent criminals are clustered and monitored easily. These areas were not rebuilt because of cost-cutting and to give the people outside some space. It's specifically noted that if Sibyl <em>really</em> wanted to destroy these places, it could do so easily. They only exist because Sibyl allows them to.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>: The very first episode of the series featured a criminal who was shown clearly on Ginoza's information screen to be 39 years old with a birthday of April 20, 2074. However, the series begins on November 4, 2112. If he was 39 years old, it would have to be 2113, which means that either the man's age or his birth year is incorrect. Then a moment later they get Akane's data right, as her birthday is April 1, 2092, and her age is 20.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>: The talk about history that Akane and Yayoi have in <em>New Edit</em> Episode 10 has Yayoi revealing to Akane that information on the past found online is heavily edited by the Sibyl System in order to present a version of history where a system like Sibyl would have been inevitable. Any lines of thinking that society could possibly function without Sibyl have been redacted out. Keeping this historical fiction true is also why Sibyl keeps Japan as a closed society that maintains no foreign relations.</li></ul></div><p></p><hr><div class="indent">"I have detected that you are experiencing a great deal of stress.
