Initially a major success, its relatively adult story content is credited with introducing Western audiences to the sophisticated dramatic potential that Japanese animation had to offer, or even possible for animation itself. This, in turn, fueled interest in anime that was oriented towards the original Japanese productions unedited by American producers.</p><p>This is ironic, because <em>Robotech</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a> of three different anime series, edited together by Carl Macek of Harmony Gold. Macek had wanted to bring the Japanese anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> to western television, but was unable to since it did not possess the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixtyFiveEpisodeCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixtyFiveEpisodeCartoon">sixty-five episodes</a> needed for a syndication deal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0204r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0204r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0204r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was supposed to have 48, but this was slashed to 36 due to production costs</span>. Macek's solution was to tie <em>Macross</em> to two other unrelated series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">similar elements and art styles</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada">Genesis Climber MOSPEADA</a></em>, and to turn the whole thing into a multi-generational saga, using <em>Macross</em>'s Protoculture&mdash;now retrofitted to be the fuel source behind the various technology used by the different races&mdash;as the uniting factor between each series. In addition, Harmony Gold found out that the model company Revell had already bought the rights to several <em>Macross</em> models (as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss">Super Dimension Century Orguss</a></em> and ironically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram">Fang of the Sun Dougram</a></em>), releasing them under the name "Robotech", as well as a comic book made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> with an original setting. As an agreement to keep brand synergy, the name was kept. The DC comic, which at the time only had two issues, and its continuity, was dropped.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The series was therefore divided into three sagas or arc, each portraying a generation of characters. They are:</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>"The Macross Saga"</strong> (36 episode arc adapted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Macross</a></em>), the story of pilot Rick Hunter and the crew of the SDF-1 battle fortress. Of the three adaptations, this one has the most in common with the original anime. Names were changed. The biggest changes were mostly made to help fit all three series together. The relationship between the Zentraedi and the Robotech Masters, for example. It mostly comes in the form of backstory dialogue, though a few episodes late in the series have <em>Southern Cross</em> footage of the Masters spliced into them.</li><li> <strong>"The Robotech Masters"</strong> (a 24 episode arc [the first episode being an American-made clip show] adapted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Southern Cross</a></em>) had arguably the greatest number of changes, starting with moving the setting from the faraway planet Glorie down to Earth, and ending with, well, the ending, which became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> because of the following arc. <em>The Robotech Masters</em> features Dana Sterling, the (first) daughter of Max and Miriya Sterling from Macross. Having been left on Earth in the care of General Rolf Emerson, she has joined the Army of the Southern Cross, and unlike her high-flying parents, pounds the ground in a Veritech Hovertank. Naturally, she ends up on the front lines when the Robotech Masters, the men behind the Zentraedi, invade the earth searching for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Protoculture</a> Matrix hidden in the wreckage of the SDF-1 <em>Macross</em>.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>"The New Generation"</strong> (a 25 episode arc adapted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada">Mospeada</a></em>), concerns the Invid, enemies of the Masters and the Zentraedi, who conquer the Earth after it is accidentally seeded <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or, rather, purposefully, seeded according to the Shapings' design, according to the novelizations </span> with the Invid Flower of Life, the source of Protoculture, following the conclusion of the war against the Robotech Masters. Earth forces that left the planet between the first and second generations return to save their homeworld, including Scott Bernard, who finds himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave">the only survivor</a> of the first counter-invasion. Scott gathers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> on his way across the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a> the Earth has degenerated into in order to reach the Invid home hive of Reflex Point.</li></ul><p>In addition to redubbed anime, several comics, novelization and original tie-in novels and games, have attempted to relate the story, with varying levels of success, within and between the Robotech "generations". One of the most ambitious was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RobotechIITheSentinels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RobotechIITheSentinels">Robotech II: The Sentinels</a></em>, which chronicled the story of the <em>Macross</em> heroes as they go into space towards the Robotech Masters' homeworld to stop any further wars. Naturally, they miss them, only to find the planet besieged by the second faction of the Invid, and meet a collection of alien races fighting to free themselves from Invid domination. Although the animated series fell apart after a few episodes were created, the story continued in comic, novel, and tabletop RPG form, each offering similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeContinuity">variant takes on the story</a>.</p><p>Another stillborn project was <em>Robotech: The Movie</em> (a.k.a. <em>Robotech: The Untold Story</em>), which spliced footage from the show with scenes from the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Megazone23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Megazone23">Megazone 23</a></em> in order to create a story set between the "Macross" and "Robotech Masters" sagas. Unlike <em>The Sentinels</em>, this project was completed, but its tepid reception during test airings (resulting from audiences believing that the film was appropriate for kids) caused Harmony Gold to shelf it. It has never had a wide release inside the states, though it was released in Latin America. The fact that the rights that Harmony Gold/Cannon Pictures had for <em>Megazone 23</em> expired is another reason that the feature will never see the light of day. A heavily edited version is included as a bonus feature on various <em>Robotech</em> DVDs.</p><p>One of the stranger aspects of all of this was how Harmony Gold could obtain the US trademark for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> just by defending the rights to <em>Robotech</em>. Japan and the US did not have reciprocity for copyrights at the time and Bandai/Big West (the owners of <em>Macross</em>) had sublicensed the international distribution rights to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TatsunokoProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TatsunokoProduction">Tatsunoko Production</a>, who licensed all aspects of <em>Macross</em> except the Japanese model kits to Harmony Gold. Bandai also licensed several mecha designs to FASA for use in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kfum');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1kfum" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kfum');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="https://www.sarna.net/wiki/The_Unseen">According to Sarna.net<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a website dedicated to the lore of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse">BattleTech Expanded Universe</a>, FASA might not have had a rightful license in the first place - the importer who cut the deal, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.sarna.net/wiki/Twentieth_Century_Imports">20th Century Imports<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, had deliberately misrepresented their own associations with Bandai, and allegedly had no legal claim to said rights themselves</span>, and they were incorporated and used in the miniatures game. FASA had sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlaymatesToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlaymatesToys">Playmates Toys</a> over alleged copyright infringement for a design in their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad">Exo Squad</a>/Robotech</em> crossover line that resembled a "Mad Cat". Harmony Gold countersued FASA for the longstanding use of <em>Macross</em> IP in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, citing their license from Tatsunoko. The suit was settled out of court, and the settlement was sealed so the settlement terms are not known. However, the suit forced FASA to voluntarily remove the offending designs (now known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">The Unseen</a>") out of fear of renewed legal hassles. Big West subsequently successfully sued Tatsunoko (but only in Japan), as <em>their</em> license to <em>Macross</em> was originally only to cover the original animation content of Macross, and <em>not</em> any derivative content based thereon.</p><p><span class="asscaps">The end result of the convoluted legal snarl:</span></p><p></p><ul><li> Harmony Gold can continue to release the original <em>Robotech</em> stories, and can also release the original <em>Macross</em> in the US, but cannot create derivative works based on it for film or TV. However, they can still create merchandise featuring the characters, including books, games and comics.</li><li> However, they <em>can</em> create derivative content based on <em>Mospeada</em> and <em>Southern Cross</em>, which are both wholly owned by Tatsunoko in the first place. Consequently Harmony Gold's more recent sequels, most notably the original feature-length film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotechTheShadowChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotechTheShadowChronicles">Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles</a></em>, are all set in or after the part of the Robotech timeline drawn from <em>Mospeada</em>. References to the characters or events from the <em>Macross</em> or <em>Masters</em> seasons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">subtle at best</a>.</li><li> In addition, they effectively have veto rights for the imports and English translation of <em>Macross</em> merchandise and series that are not covered by the original license. Consequently, all <em>Macross</em> productions with the exception of the original series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus">Macross Plus</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossII">Macross II</a>: Lovers Again</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2iccl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2iccl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2iccl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the latter two were "snuck in" by LA Hero under Harmony Gold's radar at a time when their TV production and licensing divisions were badly savaged by a "headhunting" raid by Haim Saban. By the time HG could have contested it, it was too late.</span> are blocked from being sold or translated in North America (as Big West and Studio Nue do not want to pay them). Under Harmony Gold's unchallenged interpretation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShojiKawamori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShojiKawamori">Shoji Kawamori</a> cannot make or distribute his own drawings and designs within North America. This has not made them popular.</li><li> In 2017, the terms of said legal proceedings were partially unsealed as part of a legal case between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TatsunokoProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TatsunokoProduction">Tatsunoko Production</a> and Harmony Gold.

This generally comes up only in the later two parts of the show. The <em>Macross</em> section is a faithful adaptation, right up until the very end; it's only when they tried bolting things onto <em>Macross</em> that problems began to pile up. The novelizations tried to answer these, with varying degrees of success. Examples:<ul><li> The first and most obvious one being the "mystery of the invisible SDF-2". The reason? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the Masters section there's 3 mounds which in <em>Robotech</em> are supposed to represent the ruins of the SDF-1 and Khyron's ship that crashed into it, inside which is found the Flower of Life which is supposed to be the source of Protoculture. Basically they had to make up the SDF-2 to account for the third mound, and had it that Lisa Hayes was to be its commander. No such ship appears in the original <em>Macross</em> (yet. An SDF-2 (the <em>Megaroad</em>) would come up later), so we don't see it in the Macross Saga footage.</span></li><li> Why does Dana Sterling have green hair as a baby but is a blonde by the time she grows up (dye job? recessive gene from her dad's side of the family?

Guess which side wins... There are several justifications for this, though. First, the Zentraedi never figured anyone would be stupid enough to attack an armada of five million ships. Second, at the same time the attack was going on, Minmei's song was being broadcast to the <em>entire</em> Zentraedi fleet. The Zentraedi, having <em>no</em> culture of their own, are transfixed... well, most of them. Third, one of the ships on Earth's side is the SDF-1, which was Zor's personal ship and is notably stronger/different than most other ships of its type to protect both Zor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">the Protoculture Matrix</a> on board (and that the Zentraedi want to capture relatively intact <em>precisely</em> for this reason).

Fifth and final, Zentraedi defectors helped plan the attack, which involved using the highly regimented society of the Zentraedi against them.

Quite a few of them are a bit too young to remember when anime (then called Japanimation) was practically unheard of in the USA. Older anime fans remember that the only reason Robotech was created was because of the popularity of <em>Star Blazers</em>, which fused together separate different incarnations of the same series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>, made sizable edits for an American audience, and was one of the first English dubbed anime to broach maturer themes with an emphasis on the story being shown in order.

Only the <em>Macross Saga</em> heroes and a <em>Masters</em>-era Dana Sterling from an alternate future can stop the Invid.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>: Scott chews out locals more than once for not standing up for themselves to the Invid. However, at one point, the conflict centers around the death of Alfred Nader, a man who argued for leaving the fighting with the Invid to the professionals and was killed for it before the start of the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingStillOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingStillOn">Is This Thing Still On?</a>:<ul><li> In Khyron's first appearance, a subordinate says that his fleet collided with four friendly ships and that the subordinate had won a bet. While Breetai is still watching them.</li><li> Roy Fokker had a similar moment in the first episode when he is giving an airshow when Rick Hunter comes barnstorming into the airspace. Fokker is yelling at Rick through the mike's radio function forgetting that the speakers are also amplifying his speech to the audience and they are laughing it up. Embarrassed, Fokker orders the mic to be switched to radio only.</li><li> As a meta-example, Robotech's ratings took a dip after the episode 'Force of Arms' because viewers had assumed the show was over now that the Zentraedi were destroyed and Rick had picked Lisa over Minmay. When they came back, they were shocked to find that the show was still going on, and that it was dealing with the aftermath. Some fans who had watched Robotech never came back, and didn't learn about Southern Cross or the Invid saga until years after its first run.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>:<ul><li> Many, with the biggest one being Zor in his early days for how he 'discovered' the secrets of Protoculture and the Flower of Life: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">he literally seduced the Invid Regess</a> to convince her to spill the beans, in the process he convinced her to adopt her humanoid form, and then left her to fight with her husband the Regent.</li><li> Rand has a moment of this when he tells Rook's mother "get a job" before leaving Rook's home town with her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>: So abundant that an alternative name for this series could be "Jerkass Has a Point: The Series":<ul><li> Lynn Kyle started off a well intentioned pro-peace anti-war advocate but gradually degenerated into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> control freak due to stress from living in a war zone where his views weren't easily achievable, alcoholism, and resentment of not getting any return on the emotional investment he'd made in his cousin Lynn Minmei. While war is an undeniably terrible thing and peace greatly preferable to war, Kyle took his black and white view of the situation to an irrational extreme, making him a reversal of Rick Hunter, who also began the series with a similar black and white view of the world but eventually learned to accept the shades of gray that exist in reality. Kyle's final appearance in <em>Private Time</em> had him splashing water in Minmei's face (when she claimed to be tipsy) and then forcefully hauling her out of a restaurant after she irresponsibly blew off a media engagement to have lunch with Rick Hunter and then chastises her for running out on the concert she was supposed to give before telling her that he's leaving as her manager. Although he was an unreasonable jerk Kyle was also undeniably right when he chewed Minmei out for not appreciating the good fortune she'd had in life. At least at the end he's finally self-aware enough to realize he's part of the problem and genuinely wishes Minmei well as he walks out of her life. Also, some of his points against war are genuinely good, and Lisa <em>uses them when talking to her father</em>.</li><li> Prior to their last meeting, Minmei called Kyle out a few times for copping an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a> attitude in light of how everyone was suffering equally and also for his own ingratitude towards the Veritech troops who had protected and rescued them in their time of need. This back and forth calling each other out for their bad behavior ultimately led to Kyle's realization above, driving them further apart;</li><li> Khyron is a violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, often seeking battle with the humans even when it doesn't benefit the Zentraedi and trying to sabotage the peace talks, the latter under the justification that the Grand Fleet <em>will</em> come and kill them all, Earthlings and Zentraedi all, if they catch wind of that. Not only Breetai agrees with the latter point, but the Zentraedi Grand Fleet shows up as soon as Dolza is informed by Azonia; previously, during the ambush on Mars he shot down a soldier that tried to attack early, stating that they needed to wait and that if <em>he</em> could do it then his men could do the same. Not only that soldier trying to attack early nearly ruined the ambush, but following episodes make clear that if you can't wait as long as he can you're a suicidal idiot.<ul><li> During the assault on the SDF-1, Khyron shoots a Zentraedi from another unit, and starts trying to do the same to his own men when they run. All of them had confessed they were planning to ditch the fight to go look at Minmei's concert, something that amounted to <em>desertion in the face of the enemy</em>: he was perfectly justified in killing them all on the spot, and he was actually going easy by making an example of the former to try and recover everyone else (who instead panicked), and is in fact screaming to his men to <em>go back to the fight</em> as he's chasing them.</li></ul></li><li> In "The Masters" saga of <em>Robotech</em> Colonel Fredericks of the Global Military Police, whose job is both of military intelligence and to enforce military discipline, often offers harsh criticism of Dana's actions as an officer. Thing is, Dana's squadron is more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels">biker gang</a> than a military unit, in her first on-screen encounter with the GMP Dana <em>toppled a security robot just because</em>, and Fredericks has shown some respect for Dana's battlefield prowess;</li><li> Being effectively Fredericks' disciple, Nova Satori has her moments, especially when trying to bust Musica and Bowie when the first one comes to Earth. Thing is, Musica may be on Earth's side, but she's still a triumviroid (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clone subject of the Robotech Masters</a>), and the last time a subject of the Masters apparently joined the Earth defenders he was actually a brainwashed spy, and as a member of the GMP her job description includes hunting down spies <em>and</em> those who help them;</li><li> Again in "The Masters", supreme commander Anatole Leonard of the Army of the Southern Cross often acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, advocating offensives against the technologically superior Robotech Masters in spite of the enemy's superior firepower and defences, rudely ordering the commander of the first counterattack wave to send in the new fighters against the Masters' motherships in spite of the failure of the better-armed large warships, and not caring that the Masters' troops could be actual human beings and not brainwashed micronized Zentraedi (and in fact he apparently refuses to even consider the idea, kicking Dana out of a meeting when she proposes it): aside for being <em>less</em> bloodthirsty than his superiors in the government (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm">facepalming</a> at some of their demands), the Masters are unwilling to talk, and the only way to defeat them is through the desperate counterattacks he demands; the new fighters are apparently the <em>only</em> reason the first wave survives, as they are launched at the same time as the Masters' launch their corvettes for the final blow and prove a match for them; and with the Masters unwilling to talk the actual identity of their soldiers doesn't matter (and in fact believing them being basically biological robots is useful for the troops), and Dana in that meeting was being insubordinate to the point of calling him a fool (Dana is a <em>lieutenant</em>. She was lucky to not get demoted to private);</li><li> Sergeant Angelo Dante. Generally acting sarcastic, dismissing his commanding officer in the 15th Squadron for being a woman and scatterbrained, and when Zor Prime, a bioroid pilot of the Robotech Masters, is shot down and captured and, having lost his memory, is reassigned to the 15th Squadron in the hope he'll recover it and help the Earth armies, treats him as a spy. He's right on two points: his superior officer is the above-mentioned Dana Sterling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">a tactical genius with few peers, an incredible ditz outside battle</a>, and rather childish and spoiled; Zor Prime is a (unwitting and brainwashed) spy, who got his memory wiped and his bioroid shot down by friendly fire <em>precisely</em> to insert him as a spy, the Masters hoping he'd give the the location of Earth's reserve of Protoculture with the device that transmits everything he sees and hears to them (he succeeds, and as a bonus he accidentally gave forewarning about Earth's counteroffensives against the Masters);</li><li> The twice-mentioned Dana Sterling. She's childish, spoiled and thoughtless, treats Zor Prime as her own personal property, and gets mad when Dante continues keeping an eye on him in spite of mounting evidence he's a spy. But when it comes to tactical decisions she's usually right (she's been even described as a tactical genius, and has proven it by taking on the suicide missions of downing a Masters' mothership and then perform a recon in arms and completing th first succeessfully with minimal losses and aborting the latter when it became effectively impossible and <em>still</em> bringing home some useful data plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype">a completely intact bioroid</a> that had tried to cut her escape), and can be counted on providing useful advice when her subordinates have emotional issues;</li><li> Octavia's rant when the Masters imprison her and Allegra for their sister Musica's defection may sound jerkish... Except at this point she's still loyal, even if her clone, raised to think as one with both Octavia and Allegra, has defected (even if this opens a whole other can of worms, what with the Masters' society rejecting individuality...);</li><li> After overcoming the Masters' brainwashing and joining the Southern Cross for real, Zor Prime becomes this out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">cynism</a>. Musica feels bad for having effectively betrayed her people and sisters? He points out she's beyond forgiveness for betraying those who trusted her, just as <em>he himself is</em> (the fact he ignores how he had been brainwashed into doing it doesn't matter to him: he betrayed first his companions in the 15th Squadron and then the Masters). He declaring he should have stayed on the Masters' mothership that he blew up, never mind how disrespectful to the soldiers who fell in combat until then? He can't trust himself to not fall again to the Masters' conditioning, he's a security risk. Calling Nova and confirming her suspicions about Musica being a Tirolian triumviroid? Read again why he feels he should be dead, and add to it that his phone call is the only reason why Nova (who had almost worked out what was happening on her own) didn't arrest the whole squadron;</li><li> As "The Masters" is full of such guys, it's only appropriate that the eponimous Robotech Masters join the group. In the latter part of the saga the Masters interrupt offensive operations against Earth to try and deal with the Invid Sensor Nebula before it can detect the presence of the Flower of Life and thus summon the Invid... And then often wonder <em>why</em> the Southern Cross starts launching continuous offensives against their fleet in spite of the Masters' technological superiority translating in superior firepower and robust <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> that always cause <em>heavy</em> losses to the Southern Cross. They also imprison Allegra and Octavia for Musica's defection... But as they are triumviroids, that is <em>a trio of clones based on the same genetic matrix and raised to think and act as one</em>, it's only natural they expect the other two to try and defect at the first chance (as they in fact later tried to do) or otherwise do something dangerous now that their sister has started thinking on her own and isn't there to balance them anymore, and strangely generous on their part to not just execute them on the spot;</li><li> During the Battle of Reflex Point, the Invid Regess points at the Robotech Expeditionary Force's all-out offensive trying to reconquer Earth, even having weapons of mass destruction ready in case they lose, as proof that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>. Sure, she may not know just what the Invid Regent did on Tirol, but considering that the Invid occupation of Earth translated in the conquerors not only letting the Humans do as they wished as long as they didn't try to oppose them nor tried to break the tight regulations on Protoculture (that, incidentally, is the fuel for the mechas and guns that can actually pose a danger to the Invid) but also <em>repairing Earth's ecosystem after the Zentraedi's bombardment brought it on the brink of collapse</em> it's easy to see why she had such a low opinion of the REF. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That and she had recognized the REF new equipment as coming from the Haydonites, meaning their ancient enemy was manipulating the Humans into trying to do the dirty work for them...</span>;<ul><li> In <em>The Sentinels</em>, every scene involving the Regess, be it her recorded voice or her in person, has her insulting the Regent and his crusade against the Tirolian race, detailing <em>why</em> she's insulting him. Every single insult and their justification is spot-on.</li></ul></li><li> To complete the list, we have the Invid Regent. Who, in the one <em>Sentinels</em> scene in which he appears with his wife he quickly counters her later tirade of insults by pointing out that <em>she</em> is responsible for their situation in the first place, having got seduced by Zor into giving him the secrets of Protoculture, and that the supposed evolution she's gone through since then looks suspiciously like an imitation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">humanlike Tirolians</a>. Notable because not only the Regess doesn't counter either of his points, but on Earth (long after she got fed up with him enough to dump him) she tacitly aknowledged the second by <em>researching a better form into which transmutate herself and the Invid</em> (the fact the research ultimately indicated the Human form as the best one may or may not be a coincidence).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>: Rick Hunter has shades of this, as does Sean Philips and Sgt. Angelo Dante. Even Rand has moments of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">Kansas City Shuffle</a>: After Musica defects and comes with the 15th Squadron back to Earth, Angelo reminds them how the GMP treated Zor Prime once they got their hands on him and don't count on her being a civilian to give her any sort of protection, so they need a way to get her past the GMP at the spaceport. First it seems that they have her dress up as a Southern Cross Soldier. But Nova notices a trooper on a stretcher, and remembers Dana didn't note any troopers listed as that injured... Dana tries to stop Nova, but Nova takes their helmet off and... It's Sean claiming to have shrapnel in one of his big toes. Sean flusters Nova so much she's distracted from getting finer details. Musica is one of the troopers carrying him. It's only later that Nova realizes there is no soldier in the 15th squadron who matches the name Dana gave Musica while in disguise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>: A few:<ul><li> Miriya: one can only imagine all the terrible things she did before encountering Max and the gang, and she doesn't exactly suffer for whatever crimes she committed prior to the series either.<ul><li> Gloval actually, at her wedding no less, reminds the people of the many RDF pilots she's killed... and says that they need to move past this for the sake of peace (she was a soldier at war after all).</li></ul></li><li> Before the First Robotech War, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anatole Leonard and T.R.

Even the Regent:<ul><li> Bodolza wanted the means to free his people, that were on the SDF-1. If he had to kill an entire planet to achieve it... Well, it's not like he hadn't given them the choice of surrender before doing it.</li><li> Khyron and Azonia wanted to save the surviving Zentraedi from the Robotech Masters' revenge.

That recovering the Protoculture Matrix and rebuilding the Tirolian Empire, and if they had to kill Earth's population... Well, they didn't fire first, and they did give them a chance to surrender and/or leave the planet.</li><li> The Invid Regent's main goal was to recover the Protoculture Matrix and the Flower of Life and save the Invid. His means to that are a mere consequence that by now he's gone crazy.</li><li> The Invid Regess too wanted the Protoculture Matrix and the Flower of Life, and once she got them she remained on Earth and occupied the planet because that was were the Flower was. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillain">she treated the Humans well, as long as they didn't actively fight her children</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Episode 18, "Farewell, Big Brother"</span>.

The last we see of them is the boss covering up his own fear. That the Invid blew up their firepower could be a good or bad thing as the owner of the local club claims this gang of blood thirsty bullies are the closest thing the town has to 'local authorities.'</li><li> The Triumviroid was a floating AI controlled attack robot created by the Robotech Masters meant to phase out the Bioroid pilots praised as 'functioning as perfectly as ourselves' by the Masters, and after its showing in one scene, it never appears in the show again except in some vague background shots. (Justified in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, where it's explained they proved to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeYetImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeYetImpractical">gas guzzlers, and the modifying of the Masters' production lines would be far more trouble than for producing the Invid Fighter.</a></li><li> The "protoculture wraiths" appear on the Robotech Masters' view screen when they're first taking a peek at the ruins of the SDF-1. The Robotech Masters wonder what is up with them, and they're never seen, nor brought up, again. (The McKinney novelization regularly invoked them to justify why the Masters couldn't find the Matrix on their sensors, and they're shown as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">the reason the final explosion of the mothership only scatters the Flower Of Life across the planet</a>.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: When a disillusioned Scott angrily retorts to little Anne's optimistic boast about becoming a miniature army with their new firepower, that they'll all ending up like "this!"

The Regent ironically, begins to adopt the Robotech Masters' militant attitude. T.R. Edwards in the novelization notes that the Regent's personal chambers feel like a movie set, set up in imitation of something else.</li><li> Marlene/Ariel points out to her fellow Invid they're delivering the exact same evil onto humanity that was delivered onto the Invid when their own home world was stolen from them. It takes a while for it to sink in.</li><li> The Regess implies this is humanity fate as they've absorbed traits from the Zentradi and Robotech Masters. Scott is fixated on his duty and mission... much like a Zentradi. She vaporizers some of the RDF fleet on her way out as her way of rejecting humans becoming a second group of Robotech Masters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid">You Need to Get Laid</a>: Claudia Grant is constantly telling Lisa Hayes this in one way or another.
