Furthermore, their reaction towards the Commons comes off as much pettier, since THEY are the ones who left the citizens to dry, spreading crime and violence, rather than the Satellite residents needing to steal due to the scarcity of resources caused by the Zero Reverse.</span><ul><li> However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Commons aren't much better.

Even Shinji's speech seems soon forgotten, and the citizens mock Yuya for daring to claim that the enslavement of losers is wrong, then they're thrilled when his duel turns violent.</span> While they're still the victims, their status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a> makes it hard to root for them.</li><li> On top of that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Commons are quick to violence and anger. At first it seemed righteous but when all hell started to break loose with Academia's invasion, they took the opportunity to revolt. What was discovered is that instead of pushing towards equality like those found in <em>5Ds</em> they instead choose to try and flip the system entirely with themselves on top. Thus it's true they support the system, they just want themselves on top. In many ways they are no better than the Tops and went out of their way to cause harm and mayhem and even betray Crow who wanted to find a more peaceful solution. They didn't even care about Academia's invasion, putting their "revolution" above all else.</span></li><li> Academia itself, being based on Duel Academy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh!

None of them is actually important to the tournament plot and they are eliminated pretty early, most of them off-screen or very quick. Particularly, the LDS trio, who are supporting characters, are highlighted with the rest of the supporting cast, but all of them besides Masumi, who was eliminated before the opening was first aired, suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> and they have lost their prominence in the show.

In the show proper, not only does Yuya not use Odd-Eyes Rebellion during the span the show used this opening except at the beginning, but he and Yugo never duel. Their only meeting came at the end of episode 91, and they never spoke - they just dueled their opponents in the same room. What's more, neither of the two bear any ill will towards each other; in fact, Yugo seems to think Yuya's a pretty cool guy if Yuzu thinks so highly of him.

Consider, for instance, the number of times Kurosaki opens with three copies of Vanishing Lanius, or the number of situations that make Smile World (a recurring card that looks mediocre on paper) work.</li><li> Surprisingly enough, there is actually some aversion to this trope when looking at the deck types used in the series. Hokuto and Yaiba, who use the Constellar and X-Saber archetypes respectively, make pretty standard plays in respect to how the real <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> card game is played. With those Archetypes, getting out one or two monsters with 2500+ ATK on the first turn is pretty normal, especially when it's shown that characters carry multiple copies of cards.</li><li> It's also noteworthy that there's one character who is famous in-universe for this, so much so it's part of his canon nickname. Also noticeable is that he frequently does a chant and concentrates before drawing, which hints that, like the Shining Draw in ZEXAL, his luck might actually be some sort of supernatural ability.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience">Magic Versus Science</a>: Unlike past <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> series, science has the main focus.

The previous episode was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>, but this episode was not so good in terms of animation, especially the first half. However, the animation of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon</span> was the highlight of the episode, which might be another justification why the rest of the episode wasn't animated so well.</li><li> Episode 61's animation and proportions are absolutely <em>horrendous</em>, with several characters looking like they have slanted faces, Gongenzaka looking squashed in every group shot, a lot of background characters having "dead eyes" and having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">Dull Surprise</a> expression on their face when their not over exaggerating their emotions to a ridiculous degree, and even the monsters themselves are draw rather "derp"ishly.

The faces of many characters who aren't Kaito are often drawn badly. Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon's non-CG appearance is horrible. With the well-drawn stock footage in-between, it's really jarring. And then there is the big size issue with Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon.</li><li> Yuzu and Asuka are drawn rather badly after the duel in episode 106. Like episode 46 though; this may have been due to the impressive debut of Starve Venom Fusion Dragon.</li><li> Episode 114 had possibly the worst shot in franchise history with the shot where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yusho catches Dennis's card</span>. The proportions of the character are positively awful.</li><li> Episode 118 has some emotionless faces in inappropriate situations, like Gongenzaka's during the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

When Gongenzaka Tribute Summons his Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei in face-up Defense Position, a confused Yaiba wonders how he did this; Gongenzaka explains it's because of his monster's effect. Previous series (barring <em>ZEXAL</em>) ignored the fact that Monster Cards cannot be Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position. Later, Yuya is surprised that Mieru sets a monster in face-down Defense Position, a nod to the fact that since <em>GX</em> nobody ever set a Monster Card in face-down position (again, barring <em>ZEXAL</em>).</li><li> The first time Yuzu attempts to Fusion Summon, her Duel Disk gives an error because she accidentally shuffled her Fusion Monster into her Main Deck rather than her Extra Deck.
