As Napoleon I, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Emperor</a> of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again for a hundred days, in 1815. Napoleon dominated European affairs for over a decade while leading France in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a>. Befitting the name of the events, he won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, rapidly gaining control of an united continental Europe, creating a land empire of a size and dimension that had not been witnessed (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">in the west</a>) since the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">the Western Roman Empire</a>. One of the greatest military commanders in history, his campaigns are still studied at military schools worldwide, and he remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon consolidated the foundational liberal reforms of the Revolution in France, and through his conquests was spread across Europe and the world. His lasting legal achievement, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code">Napoleonic Code<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Napoleon was born in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Corsica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Corsica">Corsica</a>, just one year after the island had passed to France from the Genoese Republic, to a relatively modest family of noble Italian ancestry from Tuscany. Serving in the French army as an artillery officer, he earned his military spurs fighting to defend the nascent French Republic from the rest of Europe, who invaded France to try and put the deposed Bourbons (the French royal family) back on the throne. During the Directory period, a group of French liberals sought to engineer a <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> and approached Napoleon for military help. Napoleon not only participated in the coup, he pulled one on his fellow conspirators. The events happened in November 1799 (18 Brumaire in the French Revolutionary Calendar, by which it has become proverbial). He became First Consul of the Consulate and gradually extended his political control over France. In his early years, he brought an end to the French Revolutionary Wars and negotiated peace with Austria and later with England. It was during this time that he worked on the development of his famous Civil Code. The Senate eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning">declared him</a> Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1804, setting the stage for the French Empire.

Eventually, the coalitions did form against France, leading him to go on a Europe-wide conquest, which he repeatedly won on land, forcing several attempts at peace with only England resisting him as a result of its island defenses and naval dominance.
</p><p>He's pretty remarkable in European history that he came from relatively modest surroundings. His father was a minor regional noble on an island even educated people forgot existed most of the time. As the son of a backwater <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">Impoverished Patrician</a>, he would not have been more than a footnote in history, a name on some obscure family tree, had it not been for the Revolution, its reforms and the instability of the era which allowed him, as it did so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungAndInCharge">other young men of his time</a>, the opportunity of a millennium.
</p><p>He embodied the ideal of meritocracy in a continent and society dominated by aristocratic hierarchy and which grew even more hostile to encroachments on their privileges upon the arrival of the Revolution and its many children, a group with which Napoleon never failed to include himself in despite doing everything he could (up to marrying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>'s niece) to get away from it. He lived by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> and was seen as the ultimate Romantic hero by the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stendhal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stendhal">Stendhal</a> (who as a young man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">served in the Grand Army and followed L'Empereur to Russia and Waterloo</a>) as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.
</p><p>He was one of the defining figures of the 19th century, but whether that was a good or bad thing was a struggle even while he was still active. Some famous anti-Napoleonites such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">Leo Tolstoy</a> would go so far as to describe him as a murderous snake, while admirers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo">Victor Hugo</a> would emphasize his badass career which no one can ever repeat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> originally dedicated his 3rd Symphony to him, then angrily gouged out the dedication upon his coronation; a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a> once saw him at a distance and had an almost religious experience. With two exceptions early in his career, the only way to defeat him was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">make sure you outnumbered him</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose">even that wouldn't guarantee it</a>). Near the end, his opponents would literally design entire campaign strategies around avoiding fighting him directly and targeting his weakest subordinate commanders. When asked to name the greatest military leader of his time, one of his final opponents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington">The Duke of Wellington</a> said, "In this age, in past ages, in any age, Napoleon."
</p><p>His downfall began in 1812 with a disastrous invasion in Russia, followed by defeat in the 1813 <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the largest battle in Europe before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. This defeat led Napoleon to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone">Abdicate the Throne</a> in 1814, with France restored to the toppled Bourbon regime, and Napoleon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">imprisoned on the Italian island of Elba</a> in 1814. This should have been the end of him as far as everyone was concerned, but a series of political failures such as the returning Bourbon dynasty's reactionary policies, resentment by younger French officers who felt they would not have access to the social mobility that early Napoleonic veterans had benefited from, as well as rumors within Elba that Napoleon would potentially be sent even further away, led him to make a daring escape and comeback.
</p><p>The Bourbon regime sent a contingent of soldiers to arrest Napoleon, but on confronting them, Napoleon cemented his legend by immediately converting the soldiers (who had been his just a year or so ago) and he returned to power in 1815, ruling for a hundred days during which he made overtures towards liberalism, such as bringing in critic Benjamin Constant to write a new liberal constitution with checks-and-balances, press freedoms as well as limits on his own power in civilian matters. But the Congress of Vienna convened to shape a post-Napoleonic Europe were having none of it, and branded him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw">Outlaw</a>. This forced Napoleon to making his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> at Waterloo which proved to be his final decisive defeat.
</p><p>Much as he feared, the other European nations sent him further away to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell">St Helena in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean</a> where he was expected to die forgotten and powerless (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/15/napoleon-had-his-own-american-dream/">personally, Napoleon wanted to emigrate to America and live out his days in genteel retirement<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). He did die there eventually of stomach cancer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pdwv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0pdwv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pdwv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are of course theories of arsenic poisoning or <em>accidental</em> arsenic poisoning? Well, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon#Cause_of_death">he died<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, in any case.</span> But he would not be forgotten to say the least. In his retirement, Napoleon spent his time dictating his memoirs which were published posthumously and which on his death, became bestsellers in Europe, followed in turn with other accounts by visitors who enjoyed the spectacle of a former world conqueror made into a harmless, decaying old man who spent his days gardening and passing snide comments on the English governor which were generally unfair. His remains were brought back to France and buried in the H&ocirc;tel des Invalides in Paris in 1840, on the initiative of Adolphe Thiers and King Louis-Philippe.
</p><p>Napoleon was a master of propaganda and so successful at it, that much of how we see his career and legend, and his own life, derives from his own words and fabrications. The French printing presses under his rule could go so far as to fabricate entire battles solely for the purpose of glorifying the Emperor. In the field, he kept a staff of artists in his entourage (as did the Duke of Wellington) to capture and romanticise his victories as they took place. In many ways, Napoleon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDeathIsOnlyTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDeathIsOnlyTheBeginning">legend increased after his defeat and death</a>, leaving behind a legacy that would cause much problems in France, where the army periodically invoked Napoleonic grandeur to try and take power, resulting in his nephew coming to power as Napoleon III in 1848, and then later attempted coup d'etat by the likes of General Boulanger. This legacy of grandeur (what is referred to as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays">la gloire</a>") became valuable as a garb to obscure the reality that Napoleon's downfall marked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">the end of France as an international great power</a> and culminated in an occupation by foreign powers for five years (the longest until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>). Never again would France be able to singularly challenge the great powers of Europe on its own, its post-Napoleonic individual successes would come from invading and colonizing weaker and smaller nations outside Europe, while its European successes were achieved with the aid of coalitions and alliances (including with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">the British who were gracious</a> after finally coming out on top of the centuries long Anglo-French rivalry), while eventually the illusion of its status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">the pre-eminent land power in Western Europe</a> would end with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar">Franco-Prussian War</a>, which was a long-term consequence of the rise of German nationalism formed to combat and repel Bonaparte.
</p><p>Although generally recognised as the greatest general of his day by his enemies, he was prone to ignoring (what hindsight shows to be) good ideas with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It Will Never Catch On</a>," dismissing both the utility of the rifle (which cost his troops in Spain, see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em>) and Robert Fulton's steamship (see Quotes page). His tried-and-tested tactics earned him some decisive victories, but their predictability after their use in two decades of war, especially once his enemies started modernizing their armies to match his, and adopted some new technologies (such as the rifles used by the British in the Peninsular War) was a major reason for his final defeat. History debates whether he was a brilliant leader or Corsica's greatest gangster.
</p><p>France naturally celebrates his victories and he's a symbol of nationalistic pride not unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a>, but they also acknowledge that his triumphs ran directly contrary to the principles of the Revolution that gave birth to him, although they also note that in many ways Napoleon consolidated and extended its reforms across Europe, chief among them being the deghettoization of Jews. On the other hand, Napoleon reversed the abolition of slavery<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18lw2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18lw2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18lw2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not coincidentally, his wife, Josephine de Beauharnais was a descendant of a prominent slaveowning family who owned plantations in Martinique</span>, sent a disastrous expedition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Haiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Haiti">Haiti</a> whose only "success" is the dishonorable and perfidious capture of Toussaint L'Ouverture, as well as triggering a major revolt in Guadaloupe where freedmen under the leadership of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Delgr<!--C3-->A8s">Louis Delgr&egrave;s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">committed mass suicide rather than return to slavery</a>. The fact that both these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">individuals are in the Pantheon</a> of contemporary France indicates that many of his actions constitute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> for contemporary France. Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">the few pro-women reforms in the otherwise macho French Revolution</a>, such as women's rights to divorce, and inheritance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">were reversed and overturned by him</a> which needless to say does little to endear him.
</p><p>It's fairly common to see Napoleon as a tyrant and a precursor to 20th-century dictators, but the balanced historical verdict falls in the middle. It cannot be doubted that Napoleon proved willing, even indifferent, to sacrificing thousands and later millions purely in pursuit of his own greatness. But it's pointed out by more than a few historians that despite being the namesake, the Napoleonic Wars weren't entirely his fault<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2zwmy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2zwmy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2zwmy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As everyone notes, it was the British who declared war on France first, breaking the Peace of Amiens</span>, and that the conflicts often triggered and kept re-occurring because neighboring powers broke treaties they signed with him first, mostly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">they refused to see him</a> as anything other than a Corsican upstart, which more or less meant that he had to stay on the war footing. Napoleon's reforms did much to better the lives of his subjects and soldiers and in his own way, he sought to enforce the building of stable Europe, as well as support limited national sovereignty. Poles remember him fondly as an ally in their struggle for independence - to this day Napoleon is the only foreigner mentioned in the Polish anthem, of course that might be because the Polish national anthem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">was written during the Napoleonic era</a> and that the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">increased in value</a> in the century of suppression that followed.
</p><p>Napoleon's meritocratic reforms led to erosion and modification of Europe's aristocracy, by which bureaucrats working in his satellite states, as well as lawyers and other civil servants, and of course his own soldiers, could attain ranks based on their work rather than their background and lineage. In practise, this meritocracy rarely extended to the lowest classes and Napoleon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleAbidingRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleAbidingRebel">was more or less cultivating a new elite</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist">reforming the existing aristocracy rather than overthrowing it</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3phwb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3phwb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3phwb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For instance, in his invasion to Russia, Napoleon refused to consider appealing to the Russian people by manumitting serfs or promising to liberate them, his goal being to win over and pacify the elite, which on account of being a foreign invader with a "liberal" reputation only strengthened and reinforced the reactionary norms of Russia</span>. But Europe was conservative and reactionary enough that it was enough to make Napoleon seem as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Robespierre on Horseback</a>" or "the Corsican Ogre". A despot though he may have been, he was much loved by a good number of his people and his most loyal troops. The Napoleonic Code consolidated the reforms of the Revolution and codified many of its liberal reforms, the consummation of several attempts and false starts that left only someone like Bonaparte in a position to oversee it.
</p><p>Opinions are all over the place about the guy, but the fact remains that he certainly created a large legacy, for better and for worse:
</p><ul><li> The Napoleonic Code (or French Civil Code), which is still in use and constantly modernized. Essentially replaced feudal legal systems, which differed greatly according to region and the whims of local courts.
<ul><li> The Code has also been extensively exported to other countries, either directly by French colonialism or indirectly by inspiring local jurists. Most notably, the civil laws of Quebec and Louisiana are heavily based on the Napoleonic system. (The sheer amount of relearning that has to happen between a lawyer's undergraduate education&mdash;which would mostly cover American common Law, and law school&mdash;which would cover the Louisianan legal system, means that the Louisiana State Bar Exam has one of the lowest pass rate in the country.)
</li></ul></li><li> The lyc&eacute;e, a three-year course of further secondary education for children between the ages of 15 and 18 which leads to:
<ul><li> The baccalaur&eacute;at, the main qualification required to pursue university studies in France.
</li></ul></li><li> Looting of artefacts from other countries for domestic museums (making him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a>).
</li><li> The Rosetta Stone's discovery, allowing for Egyptian hieroglyphics to be read.
</li><li> Emancipation of the Jews.
</li><li> Doubling the size of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates">The United States</a> by selling French claims west of the Mississippi. The American agents had requested only a small piece of it, which he refused, only to counter-offer the entire territory. Some sources say he did this not only because the British blockade made it useless to him, but also so that the United States would become more of a threat to Britain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">They did</a>, but only briefly.
</li><li> Spread of nationalism: the idea that you owed more to your nation than to your king or lord.
</li><li> His campaigns and battles are still studied by military students to this day.
</li></ul><p>Another notable aspect of Napoleon is his love-life, which was known publicly even during his time in career and the source for tabloid fodder, which Napoleon personally encouraged because he saw it as another aspect of building his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a>, with the Emperor as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove">Ladykiller in Love</a>. The reality is fairly amusing since for most of his youth, he was considered ugly, especially in France where he was seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyYou">Corsican boor whose accent wasn't right</a> and more or less struck out with girls because he was seen as unclean and vulgar (he was poor and down-and-out between 1794-1796 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">and much given to swearing and other coarse words at inopportune times</a>) and spent his spare time with prostitutes. His first marriage and first true love was Josephine de Beauharnais, the great love of his life, visible in the many letters of their early courtship which survived. Their early passion eventually cooled as a result of mutual infidelities but remained in place until for political reasons he married the Austrian Archduchess Marie-Louise<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4hiwi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4hiwi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4hiwi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The two were clearly still in love when they divorced, which was done solely because of her inability to give birth (reputedly because of a botched abortion before they met) and an Emperor needs an heir; Josephine herself met with Marie-Louise to make sure she was a good match.</span>. He had at least half-a-dozen serious extramarital or premarital affairs and numerous shorter liaisons, and fathered at least three children, all sons (one with El&eacute;onre Denuelle, a member of the entourage of one of his sisters, one with one of his favorite mistresses, the Polish noblewoman Marie Walewska, and one with his second wife Marie-Louise).
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">The Napoleon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion">Napoleon Delusion</a> are both named after him but neither of them apply to him in any way. For instance he can't by definition have had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion">Napoleon Delusion</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Since, you know, he</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">was</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Napoleon</a>. Contrary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">popular belief</a>, he was not actually short, at least not especially.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50905');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note50905" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50905');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was known as "The Little Corporal" (<em>le petit caporal</em>) because he would fraternize with his troops and catered to the little people; petit(e) is a term of endearment in French. He was 5'2" in the <em>French</em> method of measurement, which is 1.7m (or 5'7"), a perfectly average height for a man of his time. His reputation for shortness is not helped by his habit of populating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Imperial Guard</a> with men not less than 5'5" tall, making him look short by comparison. And the rest of Europe, who had reasons to dislike him anyhow, took all this and ran with it.</span> The famous hand-in-jacket pose, much used and parodied by actors portraying him, can be seen in the page picture, by the French painter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquesLouisDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquesLouisDavid">Jacques-Louis David</a> . The trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsInPockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsInPockets">Hands in Pockets</a> is the reasoning behind this famous pose, in reality Napoleon didn't always do this pose except in portraits, like many other famous people at that time.
</p><p></p><hr><p></p><h2>Tropes associated with Napoleon Bonaparte:</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">Amicable Exes</a>: Napol&eacute;on and his first wife Jos&eacute;phine de Beauharnais. They divorced because Jos&eacute;phine was sterile and Napoleon needed an heir, but the two, particularly Napoleon, remained fond of each other. Napoleon was devastated when he learned of her death during his first exile on Elba island, and reportedly responded by locking himself in his room for days. When Napoleon died in 1821, he name was among his last words.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: Considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson">Horatio Nelson</a> and Sidney Smith to be this, as they put a stop to his conquest of Africa and left him with a deep grudge against the Royal Navy. He said of Smith, "That man made me miss my destiny."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>: Napoleon believed that the best defense was the best offense and was aggressive during his campaigns. He also started several preemptive wars.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning">Awesome Moment of Crowning</a>: His crowning as Emperor of the French was of course awesome. Besides, contrary to the tradition of the Pope crowning the Emperor, Napoleon crowned himself, taking the crown with his own hand, and then crowned his wife.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a>: Napoleon has been and still is portrayed in his iconic redingote grise (grey overcoat).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>: A strategy frequently used by Napoleon, most famously against the Russian and Austrian armies at Austerlitz. He knew the Coalition couldn't resist the chance of attacking his weakened flank, thus weakening their hold on the heights in the center of their line.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>: During his youth, Napoleon admired Pasquale Paoli, a pro-Corsican who advocated the emancipation of Corsica. During the Revolution, Paoli became a Royalist and sought to fight against the French Republic, which the (then) Jacobin Napoleon supported. Paoli and his supporters chased the Bonapartes out of Corsica and even burned down his house, and later it was occupied by the British. Napoleon never returned to Corsica <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">after his 1793 exile</a>, although he did entertain hopes, when his career was in the skids in 1795, that he could reclaim the cause of independence:
<ul><li> Napoleon himself became the victim of this during his reign in his marshal's point of view. As Marmont put it : "As long as he said 'Everything for France', I served him with enthusiasm. When he started saying 'France and me', I served him with zeal. When he started saying 'Me and France', I served him with devotion. It is only when he said 'Me without France' that I distanced myself from him."
</li><li> Many people who admired Napoleon as the hero and defender of the French revolution became disillusioned with him when he declared himself Emperor; this includes such figures as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>.
</li><li> Corsicans at first admired him for his military skills that they expected to put in service of the independentist cause when the moment was right. When he instead became Republican and opposed Paoli's revolt, he was deemed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">Category Traitor</a> and chased out of his island home, never returning again. His memory today is tolerated only because it brings tourism.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a>: Lord Byron himself admired Napoleon and thought him to be the epitome of a Romantic hero, which was what Byron called the trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>: Napoleon was a notorious charmer in his youth and well in his time as Emperor.
<ul><li> He also took this tack politically. He once stated "If I need someone, I don't make too fine a point about it. I would kiss his ass".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">Consolation Prize</a>: Elba. He was given sovereignty over it and allowed to continue using the title of Emperor, it's just that his empire was now a very small one. Suffice to say, it didn't last.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a>: Napoleon often invoked this, in imitation of Julius Caesar. He often gave what he claimed were generous terms to people he defeated, forgave several slights and attempted treachery by Talleyrand or Fouch&eacute;. Years later, on Saint Helena, he reflected on how his enemies spat on his friendship and mercy and accused him of sole responsibility for the wars and he was finally treated as a criminal belligerent rather than a sovereign:
<div class="indent"><strong>Napoleon</strong>:<em>"I may have been called 'a modern Attila' and 'a Robespierre on horseback' by the other sovereigns; but if they would search their hearts, they would know better. Had I really been that, I would perhaps be reigning still. But one thing is certain: had I been such, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">all would long since have ceased to reign</a>."</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontCallMeSir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontCallMeSir">Don't Call Me "Sir"</a>: Inverted, the British still don't call Napoleon Bonaparte "Napoleon the First", as they don't recognize that he become Emperor of the French and thought of him as a mere tyrant.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>: Entire campaign plans were built around avoiding his army entirely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>: With his army crumbling and enemies closing in from all sides, Napoleon attempted suicide on April 13, 1814, by drinking a specially made vial of poison that he had a doctor prepare for him during his disastrous retreat from Russia as a final means to avoid capture by Tsarist troops if necessary. However, that was nearly two years earlier. So when Napoleon drank the poison in 1814, it had lost its potency and failed to kill him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>: Napoleon the First, Emperor of the French. Although the British and most of the Europe didn't want to acknowledge it, leading to a whole lot of resentment and needlessly complicating diplomacy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile">The Exile</a>: Twice. Napoleon was first exiled in the island of Elba near Italy but then escaped to France. After his final defeat, the British resorted to send him to Saint Helena in the middle of the Atlantic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>: Napoleon himself was one, at least to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Old Guard</a>, while the line troops often had to fend for themselves because Napoleon never succeeded in set up a supply system proportionate to the size of his army.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">Famous Last Words</a>: On his death bed in St. Helena, Napoleon's final words were ""France, arm&eacute;e, t&ecirc;te d'arm&eacute;e, Jos&eacute;phine." ("France, army, head of the army, Jos&eacute;phine.")
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>: Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo is one of the most famous examples of this trope, and has since become synonymous with final and permanent defeat. Napoleon was beaten so decisively at Waterloo that he abdicated the French throne just four days later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>: Napoleon. He went from being the son of a Corsican minor nobleman to overlord of most of Europe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">Frontline General</a>: Napoleon wanted to be as close as possible to the battlefield. When he was commanding the French Army in Italy, his troops nicknamed him "Le petit caporal" (The Little Corporal) because he routinely performed duties in combat normally handled by junior enlisted soldiers. During the debacle of Russia, he didn't hesitate to man himself a cannon and fire at the enemy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Germans Love David Hasselhoff</a>: Much of Europe hates Napoleon. The Poles? They mostly vary between hero worship and "we love him, but...".
<div class="indent"><strong>Polish National Anthem:</strong> Bonaparte has given us the example of how we should prevail<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note63aoa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note63aoa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note63aoa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And more literally - how we should attain victory</span>.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">He's Back</a>: After his exile in Elba, Napoleon returned to France to restore the Empire, and was welcomed by the population because the king proved unpopular.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisOwnWorstEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisOwnWorstEnemy">His Own Worst Enemy</a>: Napoleon can be said to have been this on a number of occasions, but it was especially noticeable during the final stages of the wars, when his utter inability to make a lasting peace came to the fore. In 1813 he took an All or Nothing approach to negotiations, refusing to make any territorial concessions at all, which not only made peace with Russia and Prussia impossible unless he defeated them, but which also led to Austria joining the alliance against him. Still, even after the battle of Leipzig at least Austrians and Russians seriously considered making a peace with the French border reaching the left bank of the Rhine and Napeoleon on his throne, but Napoleon's stance forced them to cross the Rhine and invade France proper. During the 1814 campaign in France Metternich did not want France become weakened too much in order to create a European balance of power after the war, and thus saw to it that the Austrian army dragged its feet. However, Napoleon's intransigence and surprising military successes (which were in part made possible by the slowing down of Allied operations) finally forced the Allies to unite once more and conclude that peace was only possible if they took Paris and saw to it that Napoleon was replaced by the Bourbons - only then could they start settling the differences they had amongst themselves. One of the reasons for Napoleon's self-defeating inflexibility was that he feared that he concluded peace at the cost of any or too many territorial concessions the French would eventually depose him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It Will Never Catch On</a>: Napoleon infamously dismissed the rifle and the steamboat as useless or dangerous inventions, potentially costing him Spain and Great Britain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">Magnetic Hero</a>: Napoleon got the most magnetic during his 100 Days, when the army sent to capture him, swore fealty to him instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey">Mighty Whitey</a>: Napoleon in Egypt:
<ul><li> On his arrival in Egypt, he stated that he would promote a cultural exchange with Egyptians and urged French soldiers to respect local customs. He also had the Quran translated into French and promoted a French-Arabic dictionary to translate his bulletins to the local readers. The locals however found the translations from French into Arabic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels">hilariously bad</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationTrainWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationTrainWreck">poorly researched</a>. They also resented the French occupation especially since Napoleon subjected them to pay large indemnities and the French Army started living off the land.
</li><li> Napoleon for his part started dressing in Egyptian clothing, promoted Revolutionary festivals where he put his name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">beside the Prophet</a>. His facade of respecting local traditions did not stop him from ordering a brutal artillery attack on the Al-Azhar mosque to suppress a revolt against his occupation.
</li><li> Napoleon's invasion of Egypt did much to invent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureArchaeologist">Adventure Archaeologist</a> trope as pointed out by Edward W. Said in his Orientalism &#151; in that the expedition promoted the preservation, translation and understanding of an Ancient Culture but did so by under the assumption that they were bringing progress and civilizing the Egyptians while sweetening or denying their exploitation. The French expedition of Egypt incidentally was a failure, they even lost the Rosetta Stone to the English and Napoleon ended up abandoning Egypt and returned to France on hearing news of the instability of the Directory government, leaving a good portion of his soldiers behind to face the English, the Ottomans and the locals. But once he became First Consul, he promoted it as a propaganda victory and an attempt to bring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">Englightenment to the locals</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>: Napoleon believed that artillery would shape the battlefield in the future and made reforms to support the widespread use of cannons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">The Napoleon</a>: Averted. His legendary short stature, from which the trope name and the related term "Napoleon Complex" come from, was just that - a legend. He was 1.70m tall, which was just above average for France at the time. A combination of his unusually short legs and British propaganda gave the impression that he was tiny. Also, the Old Guard consisted of tall soldiers and he looked short by comparison in their presence. He did, allegedly, get shorter towards the end of his life - even before his probable arsenic poisoning, he did not agree with the miserable climate of St Helena, and the years of boredom at Longwood House took a terrible toll on him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">Nepotism</a>: Napoleon put his sibling on the throne of several kingdoms, not as a favor, but because he didn't trust anyone else than his family to administrate them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a>: He was rarely seen without his iconic bicorne hat.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>: Napoleon's second marriage with Marie Louise of Austria was a happy one, Napoleon having near immediately become enamoured with Marie Louise while she becomes close enough to with her husband to nickname him "Nana".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APupilOfMineUntilHeTurnedToEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APupilOfMineUntilHeTurnedToEvil">A Pupil of Mine Until He Turned to Evil</a>: Napoleon felt this way about Marshal Marmont, his former aide and longtime friend who turned against him in 1814, if his words in Saint-Helena are any indication : "I was betrayed by Marmont, whom I saw as my son, my child, my creation..."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a>: Napoleon had a habit of sending his most unpredictable friends on diplomatic missions to remote countries. Most notably, Jean Lannes and Andoche Junot were made Ambassadors in Lisbon, the former in 1801 because he had recently been involved in a financial scandal and was a bit too much of a revolutionary man for Napoleon's tastes ; the latter in 1805 because he had allegedly become the lover of Caroline, the Emperor's youngest sister, and was already showing signs of his declining sanity.
<ul><li> Napoleon also sent troops and officers whom he mistrusted to far-flung assignments. For instance, during the brief peace in Europe 1802/1803 he sent off a large part of the Army of the Rhine, which had been commanded by his rival General Victor Moreau and where the republican spirit of the French Revolution was more alive than in the armies that had been led by Napoleon Bonaparte, to Saint-Domingue (Haiti). Due to yellow fever and a losing war against the former French slaves there, few of them returned. General Decaen, one of the leaders of the Army of the Rhine, was reassigned to the command of Isle-de-France (Mauritius) and R&eacute;union in the Indian Ocean. Napoleon also tried to get rid of Bernadotte by sending him as an ambassador to the United States, but Bernadotte managed to delay his departure until war was declared with Austria in 1805, at which point he was put at the head of an army corps.
</li><li> Napoleon eventually did get rid of Bernadotte, by having him installed as the crown prince of Sweden, to succeed its childless king. It became an example of a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">Reassignment Backfire</a> as Bernadotte, as the Swedish leader, not only turned against Napoleon but held together the Sixth Coalition that formed against France in the aftermath of the failed invasion of Russia.
</li><li> He did a form of this even during the Egyptian campaign. After seeing that things were not working out, he left one of his best generals, Jean-Baptiste Kleber, in charge (essentially abandoned) with almost no notice. He viewed Kleber with some suspicion, because unlike himself, Kleber was not openly ambitious and frequently doubted his military ability (even though he was an exceptionally talented commander). Napoleon left him with instructions to carry on as normal and win more victories (knowing that this would be near impossible, even still Kleber did actually win battles, including at Heliopolis where he was outnumbered 6 to 1). Shortly after this, however, Kleber was assassinated.
</li><li> He also abandoned his men during the death march out of the Russian winter, speeding to get back to Paris before news of the disaster struck so that he could spin the story. He simply wrote them off and left them in Lithuania.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>: Napoleon Bonaparte, also called the God of War or the Corsican Ogre, depending on your sympathies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>: Damn you, Napoleon...

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>: Napoleon himself. He rose from the son of nigh-impoverished nobility, vilified for being a Corsican when France had only recently conquered it, to become Emperor of France. Primarily through a mixture of luck, good public relations and, oh yes, being very, very good at winning battles. However, he mounted the first steps of his career as a child of privilege as he owed his education to a special fund set aside by the royal French crown to support the families of Corsican aristocratic families who, like the Buonapartes, could not afford to give their children a proper education. The aim was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">better integrate Corsicans into the nobility of France</a>. And at later points his rise was facilitated by personal connections, such as to Robespierre's younger brother and to Paul Barras, de facto head of the Directorate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>: One reason why Napoleon had a lot of appeal among romantics and later historians, is that Napoleon was born in an out-of-the-way island cut off from any opportunities for advancement and ended up dying in an out-of-the-way island cut from any opportunities for advancement. His middle life had a spectacular rise and epic fall which defined the 19th Century and formed a part of his legend, which Napoleon needless to say was highly conscious of:
<div class="indent"> <em>"After me, the Revolution &mdash; or, rather the ideas which formed it &mdash; will resume their course. It will be like a book from which the marker is removed, and one starts to read again at the page where one left off."</em>
</div><div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte</strong>, <em>After his Defeat at Leipzig in 1813</em>.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">Sibling Rivalry</a>: Between Napoleon and pretty much all of his siblings, to varying degree :
<ul><li> Lucien, Napoleon's junior by 6 years, is the best example. Lucien (then President of the Conseil des Cinq-Cents) played a key role during the coup d'&eacute;tat of Brumaire. Napoleon named him Minister of the Interior. He made the mistake of being right too early, suggesting making Napoleon an Emperor as early as 1802, frightening Republicans, which brought Napoleon's wrath on him. Lucien resigned and cut off all links with his brother for 13 years. They reconciled during the Cent-Jours but Lucien was never an heir to the throne.
</li><li> Louis (Napoleon's junior by 9 years) when he was made King of Holland by his brother, who expected Louis to be a mere figure-head, actually tried to rule it as an independent country, and personally attempted to become as Dutch as possible (taking the name Lodewijk I and requiring his ministers (all French and appointed by his brother) to speak only Dutch and renounce their French citizenship like he had done.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note95qwj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note95qwj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note95qwj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though his own command of the Dutch language was notoriously poor, the people of Holland by all accounts appreciated the effort.</span> Napoleon finally had enough and annexed Holland to France. The two brothers never reconciled, even though Louis was probably Napoleon's favorite brother initially.
</li><li> Caroline, married to Napoleon's friend Murat and therefore queen of Naples pushed her husband towards betraying her brother in 1814.
</li><li> Almost all the other siblings tried to assert themselves one way or another, without much success but never without tension. The only real exception was Pauline, Napoleon's favorite sibling (and probably the only Bonaparte with the completely likable personality).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege">The Siege</a>: Napoleon Bonaparte won his first laurels at the siege of Toulon during the War of the First Coalition, while in that of the Second Coalition his campaign into Syria failed because his army could not take Acre.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Spell My Name with an "S"</a>: "Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte" in French, "Napoleone Buonaparte" in Italian the official language of Corsica at the time of his baptism, or even "Nabulione" in Corsican.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar">Weather of War</a>: All throughout his career, Napolean's armies were hindered by bad weather, which sometimes turned out to be a bigger threat than the enemy he was facing. In Egypt, his army lacked proper uniforms for desert operations, which hindered his army throughout the entire campaign. In Russia his army was devastated by one of the coldest winters in the nation's history. The night before the Battle of Waterloo, a massive rainstorm swept through the area. This forced Napoleon to delay the start of the battle for several hours while waiting for the ground to dry so he could maneuver his cannons more effectively, which gave the Prussians more time to reach the field and aid Welllington's army.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">When All You Have Is a Hammer...</a>: He was a <em>huge</em> proponent of artillery, with his tactics consisting mostly in putting his cannons in the right place to neutralize the enemy artillery and savage the enemy troops. His dependance on this tactic slowly became his undoing as his enemies caught on, even playing a decisive role at Waterloo (Wellington halted his retreat and gave battle there because a downpour had turned the whole ground in a mudhole, diminishing the efficiency of fragmentation shells and bouncing cannonballs while also making the gunners' job more difficult. Napoleon was forced to delay his army's attack until 11:00 am on the day of the battle in order to wait for the ground to dry, which cost his army several hours they could have used try to defeat Wellington before his Prussian allies arrived on the field).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, Napoleon is an Archer-class Servant wielding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">HUGE cannon</a> that doubles as a gatling gun and laser as a weapon. Unlike most popular culture, he's depicted as a tall, buff man, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">a shorty.</a> However, it is implied that if he's summoned as a Rider, he will appear short. In addition to this, Napoleon embodies all of the legends told about him (like how he is the reason the Great Sphinx doesn't have a nose) and his revolutionary spirit, manifesting as someone who will act upon people's expectations about him. Story-wise, he appears in the second Lostbelt Gotterdammerung as Chaldea's major ally in restoring Proper Human History, fighting alongside them against Valkryies, giants, and gods while at the same time flirting with the resident Crypter Ophelia Phamrsolone and getting into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CockFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CockFight">Cock Fight</a> with her Servant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is actually the fire giant Surtr himself, and even gets a chance to save Ophelia from Surtr by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">blowing his head off with his NP</a> before dying encouraging Chaldea to fight on.</span>
