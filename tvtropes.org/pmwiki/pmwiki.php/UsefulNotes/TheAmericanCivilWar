When President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> called for 75,000 troops after the attack on Fort Sumter, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina left the Union in response and joined the Confederacy.

The American Civil War "only" killed 700,000. That being said, the American conflict is about as bloody if not more so when you consider that the US had a much smaller population and a much shorter war than any of these. The Taiping war killed about 6-7% of the Chinese population of over 300 million, but that took about 14 years (for an average of about 0.43-0.5% per year). The Russian Civil War claimed about 4-5% of the Russian population of about 75-85 million over the course of five and a half years (for an average of 0.73-.91% per year). The Chinese Civil War cost about about 1.5-2% of the Chinese population of 400-500 million over the course of 13 years (interrupted by the much, much bloodier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">fight against the Japanese</a>) (for an average of about 0.12-0.15% per year). The American Civil War killed 2.3% of the US population of about 31 million over the course of less than four years (an average of about 0.57% per year), so the only one of these four that matches it in relative intensity is the Russian conflict&mdash;and the Russians had machine guns to kill each other with.</span> the Civil War was the result of a grand failure of normal politics. Modern historiography &#151; the history of history &#151; tells us that the great failure was over the future of slavery &#151; of ethnic Africans &#151; in the United States. The Southern "slave states," whose economies were based around the use of slave labor to harvest cotton<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34fno');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note34fno" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34fno');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And some other cash crops, particularly tobacco and sugarcane, but mostly cotton.</span> for export to Western Europe, feared that the federal government in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> would attempt to outlaw slavery.

There is smoke and blood <em>everywhere</em>, with doctors severing gangrened legs left and right, bugles blowing, drummer boys drumming, and cavalry charging every which way (often resulting in casualty figures upwards of 30%, per battle). Expect to see at least one man from either side bravely carrying a tattered unit flag until he gets shot with a Mini&eacute; ball and crumples artfully in a heap. One aspect that tends to get lost in nearly all depictions of the war is that as in previous wars, but unlike the ones that came after, the majority of deaths were still due to non-combat-related causes such as various diseases contracted in the field (such as &#147;camp fever&#148;) and the still-primitive state of battlefield medicine that meant almost any infected wound could kill if it wasn&#146;t on an easily-amputated limb. The cumulative effect was enough, especially near the end of the war when the campaigns were relentless, to churn out men suffering from &#147;soldier&#146;s heart&#148; &#151; what we would today recognize as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">PTSD</a>. Americans like to believe that they learned this well and kept it in mind, while the European powers didn&#146;t notice until after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> presented it to them on a massively greater scale. This is true if one sticks only to the effects of the war upon the USA&#146;s economy and society, for this period was one of rapid development that made the tactical lessons of the war irrelevant in just two decades. On a strategic level, the war is one of the first, and certainly the largest, to have mechanized supply lines via railroad. Surprisingly to many, the American Civil War was the first-ever American conflict war in which aircrafts played a role, as Union forces pioneered the use of balloons as reconnaissance and observation platforms during the Siege of Richmond and other battles. Previously, an aerial corps of balloons was deployed during the wars of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>.

Slaves work the fields down here, although whether a production chooses to show the more <em>realistic</em> aspects of slave life depends a lot on the era in which it&#146;s made. Don&#146;t expect to see many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope">whitewashed "happy" portrayals</a> of slaves in <em>any</em> modern series.

</p><p>In the North, there is industry and patriotism, and Abolitionists decry the evils of slavery from every pulpit. Abraham Lincoln is a pretty popular guy in these parts &#151; he spends most of his time in the Oval Office, brooding over battle maps and writing deep historical speeches on stovepipe hats. Ask him why he&#146;s fighting the war and he&#146;ll tell you it&#146;s to free the slaves. Never mind that this runs contrary what he actually <em>said</em> when asked, during the war; this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory">Hollywood History</a>, where heroes are pure and their motives always perfectly clear. Similarly ignored are all the explicit references to preserving slavery made by Southern governments and politicians during this time, because the product has to be sellable in all fifty states. Naturally, you don&#146;t see much of pro-slavery Confederate President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JeffersonDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JeffersonDavis">Jefferson Davis</a> in most Civil War movies.
</p><p>Oh, and remember what we said about &#147;whitewashed &#145;happy&#146; portrayals of slaves&#148; in the paragraph above?

The American Civil War was almost fated to happen, as the enduring issue of slavery had only been placated by stopgap measures. While it was far from the only factor in starting the war, slavery was certainly one of the main points of contention, as argued by the numerous declarations regarding the seceding states, who listed the maintaining of the institution of slavery as their <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em>. Sentiments regarding the abolition, or regulation, of slavery had existed since before the nation's founding, with the strongest advocates mostly being Christian groups in New England. Many noted how slavery contradicted both Christian and American ideals of equality (either under God, or under the law). <br><br>
However, at the founding of the nation, abolition was not a serious concern. Many of the nation's founders were slaveholders themselves, and even those who disapproved of the institution knew that challenging it would cause disunity among the states. Those at the Constitutional Convention were more than well aware of how contentious the issue was, especially among the Southern states, whose economies were largely dependent on slave-based agriculture. The main issue facing the convention at the time was how slaves should be counted in national population censuses, which decided how seats would be allocated in the House of Representatives: delegates from states with large slave populations wanted slaves to count in full&mdash;since any additional representatives would represent the interests of the owners rather than the slaves&mdash;while those who wanted to restrict the political power of slavery wanted only free persons to be counted. This resulted in the infamous three-fifths compromise, where three-fifths of the slave population would be counted when it came time to allocate seats. Many of the northern states already lacked large slave populations, and as a result all states north of the Mason-Dixon line (that separates Maryland from Pennsylvania) would ban slavery. <br><br>
Another compromise from the early days of the United States was on the importation of slaves. There was a 20 year grace period that would allow new slaves to be imported from Africa. After this, it would be illegal to import new slaves. Later, the US would affirm this decision with international treaties between them and other states, the most notable being Great Britain. This ban was later upheld when a group of slaves rebelled and captured the schooner <em>Amistad</em>. The courts found them innocent, declaring that they were free individuals who had the right to take any measures to free themselves from bondage, including the violent overthrow of the schooner's crew. The slaves were arranged safe passage back home to Africa through the help of sympathetic New Englanders. <br><br>
Both of these compromises seemed to quell things, but only temporarily. As the United States grew and more states were accepted into the Union, tensions flared up again. With the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, the United States nearly doubled in size. These new lands would gradually be settled and admitted statehood. With the northern states having already outlawed slavery, many of the new states admitted to the Union in the Midwestern Territory would also become "free states" upon admittance to the Union. Not all new states would go this route, however, and by 1819 the United States was divided straight down the middle, with 11 free states and 11 slave states. It was a delicate balance, as the southerners feared that a majority of free states would hand the senate over to abolitionists, who would abolish slavery wholesale. Northerners feared the opposite, that slavery would be expanded even further. The fears of both sides were not especially warranted, as abolition still wasn't a serious movement as of yet, and the slave states had no pretensions of extending slavery back into the North. However, the admittance of the new state of Missouri worried both sides. In the end, another compromise was worked out where Maine would be admitted as a free state, Missouri would be a slave state, and all territory south of Missouri, state or not, would allow slavery. All territory north of Missouri's southern border would be free soil, barring Missouri itself, of course. The compromise kept the Union from imploding for a few more decades, but it couldn't last. <br><br>
Abolition only grew stronger as time went on. The decades following the Missouri Compromise saw a massive religious revival, known as the Second Great Awakening. Many preachers took this opportunity to cast fiery and condemning attacks on the immoral institution of slavery. Slavery supporters would argue that slavery was a moral institution that benefited slaves, as a precursor to the later "civilizing mission" argument of many colonial powers. They would also decry Africans as being less than human, citing a Late Medieval belief that blacks were the "Sons of Ham" and were cursed with dark skin by God. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note51cu3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note51cu3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note51cu3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After the flood subsided in the book of Genesis, Noah became drunk and lay naked in his tent. One of his three sons, Ham, made a fuss about it and told his brothers Shem and Jafet to come look at Noah in his shame, but Shem and Jafet averted their eyes and put a blanket over him. When Noah sobered up, he cursed Ham for disrespecting his father and decreed that Ham's descendants would be slaves for the descendants of Shem and Jafet.</span> <br><br>
Numerous abolitionist groups saw an increase in members, with the American Anti-Slavery Society being the most famous. However, abolition was still not the majority sentiment in the North, with most northerners being more concerned with the spread of slavery to the Western Territories. They mostly sought to halt its expansion, but total abolition was still a far-off dream. The issue of slavery's expansion became the main point of division, with numerous proposals being floated back and forth. Some parties, such as the Republican Party, sought total federal control over the issue, and only Congress would be able to decide if a state was free or slave. The pro-slavery movement argued for "States Rights," in this case the right of states to choose whether they were free or slave at their own discretion. This is where the revisionist "states rights" argument falls apart. Yes, the South was fighting for "states rights," but the rights they were fighting for were the rights to own slaves. <br><br>
Things really shit the bed after the Mexican-American War. The vast new territories acquired from Mexico would upset the balance, either in favor of or against slavery, so efforts were made to compromise on the issue. The Compromise of 1850 had a few results. On the free soil side, California was admitted as a free state, and slave trading was banned in the District of Columbia. However, the Compromise seemed to favor the slave soil side, with states north of the previously established Missouri Compromise line being granted the right to choose whether they were free or slave by popular sovereignty. It also led to the passing of the infamous "Fugitive Slave Act," which was a revision of a much older law. Before, fugitive slaves often escaped to free states, and state authorities would not aid in the capture and return of these slaves (with some going so far as to legally declare them free). This act of defiance angered many slave states, who pressured the government into passing a much harsher law that forced law enforcement officers to aid in capturing fugitive slaves, or face heavy fines. This resulted in the growth of the Underground Railroad, an organization that would help slaves escape to Canada. <br><br>
Slavery, and the conditions it wrought, were exposed in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em>, which brought more sympathy to the cause of abolition. Following this, the <em>Dredd Scott v. Sanford</em> case effectively ruled that slaves were not citizens and had no right to sue their owners. This invalidated one method for slaves to free themselves, as they would often venture north to free states and sue their masters. The Fugitive Slave Act saw heavy condemnation from northerners, who saw it as a major southern overreach. It stoked fears of the idea that slave states would try to expand slavery to the North. <br><br>
By now, conditions had reached a fever pitch, and the Civil War was all but imminent. The government's failure to take decisive action on the issue of slavery for over half a century had led to escalating tensions on both sides, and the first waves of violence broke out in the Kansas Territory. Kansas was about to be admitted statehood in 1854, and the federal government decided to give them the right of "popular sovereignty," which would allow them to vote on whether they'd be a free or slave state. From all around the country, settlers, rabble-rousers, and ideologues gathered in Kansas to decide the fate of the Union, as the admission of this state could tip the balance in favor of either side. The end result was "Bleeding Kansas," a time when the territory was torn apart in a miniature war. On the side of the free soil, there were the Jayhawkers, mostly led by the fierce abolitionist John Brown. On the other side were "Border Ruffians" from the neighboring slave state of Missouri. Brown would later attempt to start a slave-abolitionist uprising with a failed raid on the armory at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. He was summarily executed. <br><br>
The Bleeding Kansas issue saw the end of the Whig Party, which became bitterly divided overly the issue of slavery. From the division rose the Republican Party, which was staunchly abolitionist. In response to this, many southerners began to advocate for secession if the Republican Party won. This outcome was abated for 4 more years when James Buchanan, who had what is considered by most historians to be the worst Presidential administration in American history, won the 1856 election. His administration saw some infamous events, such as Representative Preston Brooks (D-SC) brutally beating Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA) in the Senate chamber after Sumner had delivered a speech vilifying slaveholders, including a relative of Brooks. <br><br>
In this chaos, an aspiring lawyer named Abraham Lincoln rose to prominence, advocating for the Republican Party in his home state of Illinois. He attempted to run for the senate in the 1858 midterms, but was defeated by his opponent, Stephen Douglas, as at the time senators were still chosen by the state legislature, which was controlled by the Democrats. Two years later, he threw his hat into the ring as the Republican nominee, inciting a major backlash throughout the south as pro-slavery crowds vowed to secede if the Republicans won. Due to a schism within the Democratic Party, and the heavy divisions among the pro-slavery side, Lincoln won the 1860 election, and the response from the southern states followed immediately, with the South Carolina legislature proclaiming its secession from the Union.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of the War&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<p>Less than a month after South Carolina declared secession, multiple other slave states joined them, with the states of Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas all coming together in February of 1861 to declare a new nation, the Confederate States of America. Keep in mind that Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated and held no actual power, but the outgoing President Buchanan still had a limp and unwilling response to the rebellion, mostly due to his pro-slavery views. <br><br>
The first shots of the war proper were fired on Fort Sumter, near Charleston, the capital of South Carolina. Confederate forces (most of whom were, by this point, turncoat soldiers and officers) shelled the fort and forced it to surrender. In response, Lincoln called for volunteers to help put down the rebellion, prompting the states of Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, and North Carolina to secede as well, as they refused to send any forces to aid the federal cause. <br><br></p><p>Again, as is typical of civil wars, the initial phase of the war was something of a mess. The 1861 secession of the slave states didn&#146;t see <em>all</em> the slave states secede, though all those states that did secede were slave states. The slave states of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri remained loyal through the initial secession crisis and the war that followed once the U.S. Army had suppressed their more rebellious districts. A rebel state (Virginia) even suffered its own secession crisis when the half of the state (the future state of West Virginia) on the Appalachian Mountain range <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousRebel">defected back</a></em> to the government as a new slave state (albeit one with hardly any slaves and a constitutional commitment to abolish slavery by 1865). <br><br>
The loyal states of the North were also not nearly as unified in their opposition to either slavery or secession as they came to be seen in retrospect. For one thing, while it is certainly true that all of the Northeastern states had abolished slavery well before the War, it is equally true that the wealth of the coastal states (particularly Massachusetts and Rhode Island) was founded on the Atlantic "triangle trade" &mdash; or, less politely, slave ships. There was also a notable split between the industrialized Northeast and the mostly agricultural Northwest (the name then used for what is now called the Midwest).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6c1mm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6c1mm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6c1mm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In the first half of the 19th century the Northwest, a large part of which depended on the Mississippi for its outward trade, was still seen as the South&#146;s natural ally against the Northeast with its abolitionist sympathies (some New England states had already given Blacks the vote before 1860), but the conflict of interests and the improved communications to the east (railways) as well as longstanding vaguely Northern sympathies (many in the Northwest were ancestral Northeasterners&mdash;Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota were settled primarily by New Englanders and New Yorkers, as were the northern parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and much of the populations of central Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois came from similarly abolitionist Pennsylvania&mdash;and even among those that weren&#146;t, Southern settlers in the Northwest tended to come from the parts of the Virginia population that ended up Union sympathizers) slowly drove it into an alliance with the Northeast.</span> This was clearly demonstrated in the antebellum political scuffles over the future of the west-American colonies that the United States had just conquered from Mexico. The Southern states wanted to establish new slave states in those areas so that no laws outlawing slavery could be passed by the federal government.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note74hx2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note74hx2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note74hx2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is the effect of the structure of the legislative branch of the US federal government, i.e. the US Congress; Congress is bicameral (has two "houses"). The representation of each state in the "lower house" of Congress, the House of Representatives, is according to the population of each state, but in the "upper house," the Senate, each state has exactly two members (no matter how heavily or sparsely populated). The setup for the Senate made it impossible for any laws (50%-plus-one of the representatives in both houses had to approve a law for it to be approved/ratified/"made into law") to be made regulating or banning slavery despite the fact that twice as many people lived in "free" as in "slave" states. Moreover, any changes to the federal constitution (e.g. to outlaw owning people as property) required two-thirds or more of both houses to propose an amendment, and ratification by three-fourths of the <em>state legislatures</em> to approve it.</span>. Many Northwesterners opposed this because more plantations meant less space for small farms (owned by "homesteaders"), which they believed &#151; as per liberal (i.e. "free-market") ideology &#151; were more economically efficient (as it used free, rather than coerced, labor)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8wev6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8wev6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8wev6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Morality aside, this is untrue. Slave labor is an extremely efficient form of labor, though slaves have never been used (on a large scale) for anything other than the most basic tasks like plantation and factory work. It&#146;s not as profitable as you might think, though, because even though you pay them no wages you still have to house and feed them (and you might be held liable for any damages they cause to other parties). Some have tried to make the case that people work harder for their own reward than they do to avoid (their loved ones) being (sexually) assaulted, tortured, or killed. While it is true that slavery is not incompatible with rewards, Black chattel slavery in the antebellum American South was historically stingy with rewarding slaves&mdash;in contrast to, say, ancient Roman and Greek slavery (where slaves were frequently given rewards sufficient to buy their freedom, and would enjoy reasonably respectable status after manumission), Black slaves in the American South could reasonably expect to be worked to their breaking points for as long as possible.</span> and more desirable as the social-moral bedrock of a new/developing society. Still, there were sympathizers on both sides, with the mostly Northwestern "Copperheads" supporting the Confederate cause, and the "Red Strings" in the South who favored reunification. <br><br>
The pitiful US Army only numbered about 16,000 men at the time, so calls for volunteers came from both Abraham Lincoln in the North, and Jefferson Davis in the South. The first calls for volunteers attracted many thousands of men. The issue of secession was generally the thing that attracted these recruits. Although people still remained largely divided on the issue of slavery (especially in the more western states), they generally could find agreement on the issue of secession, with the Union sympathizers saying that it was illegal, and the Confederate sympathizers saying it was the right of a state to secede. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9kqq3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9kqq3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9kqq3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While many scholars today side with the Unionists, there is still some discussion on this point; the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution seemed to leave the question open, and the Supreme Court decision in Texas v White did not come till 4 years after the war. Such discussion is entirely academic, of course. </span> Many southern officers, such as Robert E. Lee, chose loyalty to their home states over loyalty to the federal government. <br><br>
The most decisive action of the war happened early on, when the Union navy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade">blockaded the major ports of the South in 1861.</a> This effectively cut off most of their imports, and seeing as the economy of the South was largely agricultural, they did not have the means to manufacture enough new weapons, ammunition, uniforms, and supplies for the troops. To make matters worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">the economy of the South was mostly dedicated to prioritizing cash crops, like cotton, and thus there was not enough food production to satisfy the nutritional needs of Southerners.</a> Ambitious blockade runners, mostly from Britain, would help to keep the Confederacy supplied in exchange for cotton, and winning international recognition and investment was the principal plan for the Confederacy's survival. The Confederates knew that they wouldn't stand a chance in a protracted war with the North, due to their inherent economic disadvantages, so they looked across the Atlantic, hoping to gain support from Britain and France. Their hope was that those nations would intervene to protect their valuable supply of cotton.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107jc2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note107jc2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107jc2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Confederacy's hopes revolved around the fact that the Union Navy at the outset of the war was pitifully small and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">most ships needed a little work.</a> Britain and France could've broken it at a moment's notice, but after the Battle of Antietam they came to the conclusion that they would honor the blockade now in exchange for political good will to spend later. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">Decades later, this proved to a most prudent diplomatic move</a>. Also, they had their own concerns with a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> organizing Prussia to their east.</span> <br><br>
This blockade plan would prove to be central to the war effort, and likely did more to end the war than any land campaign. It was supported by Ulysses S. Grant's maneuvers in the West, as he attempted to wrestle control of the Mississippi River. However, there was widespread derision of the plan, as many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">of the ignorant press and population did not see the strategic value of the plan</a> or favored decisive, quick action rather than a lengthy campaign. Thus, while the blockade was implemented, the Union moved to secure the capital of Richmond, Virginia. The Union force was rebuffed at the Battle of Bull Run <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11czo4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11czo4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11czo4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">known as the Battle of Manassas in the South</span> due to the poor coordination and morale of the Union troops. The battle is also famous for being the place where Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson got his nickname. <br><br>
Other major Confederate victories followed throughout 1861, with the Union barely managing to scrape up a few marginal victories<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12279q');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12279q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12279q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Union was particularly hamstrung at the beginning of the war by a severe imbalance in troop and officer competence. Then, even more so than now, there was a far greater "honor" placed on military service in the South, and the majority of the competent, experienced officers were Southern. The southern states had also revived the largely defunct militia system prior to the war, giving them the opportunity to train and drill a large number of men before the war began, while many Union soldiers had little experience nor training.</span>. Their advances into Virginia and Missouri were effectively halted, and it became clear that this would be a protracted war. Further out west, many of the Native American tribes of the Great Plains had chosen to side with the Union, but by the end of 1861, Confederate forces would defeat them. A major diplomatic incident threatened to bring Britain into the war against the United States. A British ship was seized by the US Navy and two Confederate diplomats, bound for Britain, were detained. Under threat of war, the US released the diplomats. <br><br>
In early 1862, the Union scored a few victories on the Western Front, gaining control of Missouri. Meanwhile, out east, the Confederates had overhauled a wooden-hull ship into an ironclad, named the CSS <em>Virginia</em>, which attempted to break the Union blockade at Norfolk, Virginia. After sinking two wooden-hull Union frigates, the <em>Virginia</em> was intercepted by the Union's own ironclad, the USS <em>Monitor</em>, which was novel for its rotating gun turret. The two engaged for several hours, but neither could pierce the thick armor plating and deliver a decisive blow. In the end, the <em>Virginia</em> retreated back to port and the blockade held, but the engagement proved the strength of ironclads to the world, being the first direct battle between such ships in history. The <em>Monitor</em> design was copied, but it proved to be unseaworthy, as rough waters could cause its low-profile hull to flood. Near the end of 1862, that exact occurrence sank the original USS <em>Monitor</em>. Meanwhile, the <em>Virginia</em> was left in port at Norfolk, and the Confederate Army abandoned the ship (and its crew). Advancing Union forces took the town, and the captain decided to light the ship aflame and abandon it. <br><br>
The Union scored more victories, advancing into Confederate territory. In the West, they had successfully captured the city of New Orleans, which controlled the mouth of the Mississippi River. The Union launched an assault on Richmond, landing the Army of the Potomac southeast of the capital. "Stonewall" Jackson and Robert E. Lee managed to halt the advance of the Army of the Potomac in a series of battles,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13gzkq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13gzkq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13gzkq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">despite taking heavy losses and losing most of the battles, the Union general McClellan decided to withdraw from the area</span> thus saving the capital. Afterwards, Lee maneuvered north to push the Union out of Northern Virginia. This resulted in the Second Battle of Bull Run, which had again proved to be a decisive victory for the Confederacy. As a result, the Confederates regained control of Northern Virginia and pushed into Maryland. <br><br>
The invasion of Maryland had several goals. One was to take the supply burden off the badly ravaged Virginia, which had seen the bulk of the land campaigns of the war thus far. The Confederates also sought much needed foreign recognition, and hoped that a decisive victory on Union soil would demonstrate to the rest of the world that they could win the war, and thus gain foreign support. They were also in a greater position to threaten Washington DC itself. McClellan, leader of the Union forces, pursued Lee into Maryland<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note147muc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note147muc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note147muc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Albeit after nearly throwing away a stupendous intelligence break when a copy of Lee's battle plans turned up and dithered for <em>18 hours</em> before taking advantage of it</span> and engaged him at the Battle of Antietam, which would prove to be the bloodiest single day of the war with a combined tally of 7,650 casualties. Lee, badly outnumbered due to his forces being scattered about Virginia, opted to retreat, making it a significant strategic victory for the Union. However, McClellan, as per usual, was too cautious and indecisive with follow-up actions, allowing Lee's forces to escape without issue. This would contribute to his sacking and replacement by Abraham Lincoln later in the year. <br><br>
The new replacement, General Ambrose Burnside<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note153hmj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note153hmj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note153hmj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, this is where the term "sideburns" comes from. Look up a picture of the guy if you want to see why.</span> went on the offensive, attempting to seize a major railroad stop at Fredericksburg, across the Rappahannock River, and use it to make a mad dash to Richmond before Lee could retaliate. Lee got to Fredericksburg first and fortified the city. Due to a tactical misjudgment, Burnside chose to assault the fortified city directly, thinking that Lee had weakened his center to draw troops to the flanks. This error proved devastating, as the Union suffered horrendous losses and received a disastrous defeat. Burnside was sacked and replaced with Joseph Hooker. The rapidity and number of replacements throughout the year really made the Union leadership look incompetent, lending it a sort of "revolving door" appearance. <br><br>
Lincoln used the Battle of Antietam to announce the Emancipation Proclamation on the first of January, 1863, declaring that all slaves within the Confederate territories were now free men. The proclamation only pertained to the "states in rebellion," however, so the slave states that had sided with the Union<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1660ws');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1660ws" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1660ws');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware</span> would still be allowed to own slaves. While the proclamation was still limited, and at the time had little practical value, it was a major moral victory and it made the end of slavery a war goal of the Union. This was a great political maneuver on the part of Lincoln, as it effectively crushed any international sympathy for the Confederate cause, as now foreign states would be explicitly helping to preserve slavery<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17470l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17470l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17470l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which most European nations had already outlawed</span>. This was crucial, as cotton shortages in Britain forced many in its government to entertain the idea of intervention. It emboldened many slaves, and resulted in some slaves in occupied territory being freed. Many of these slaves would go on to join the Union army. <br><br>
The new Major General, Joseph Hooker, sought to envelop Lee's army and launched an offensive near Chancellorsville. Lee split his forces and stopped the advanced, causing Hooker to dig in around the town. Confederate forces surrounded Hooker, while at the same time fighting his flanking force at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg. While the Second Battle of Federicksburg was a Union victory, Hooker withdrew from Chancellorsville. Lee would win a strategic victory by halting Hooker's advance, despite having about half the manpower available, but Lee's losses were proving unsustainable for the underequipped and outmanned Confederacy. To make matters worse, "Stonewall" Jackson was shot in a friendly fire incident, while scouting after dark. He died of illness just a week later. Hooker's defeat resulting in him being replaced <em>yet again,</em> this time by Major General George Meade. <br><br>
Lee formulated another invasion plan of the North. Emboldened by his successive victories, he decided that an ambitious push all the way into Pennsylvania might be enough to force the North to terms. He was also driven by an increasingly dire supply situation, as the Union blockade put a stranglehold on the South's economy and left his forces thin on supplies. This was effectively going to be the last hurrah of the Confederacy, as they were losing badly in the West and at sea. Lee had to score a victory here, or lose the war. <br><br>
In July of 1863, Lee began to move his forces through war-ravaged Northern Virginia once more, evading Union lines and marching all the way to Pennsylvania. The Union forces caught up to them around the town of Gettysburg, where they fortified the hills and ridges surrounding the town, giving them a major tactical advantage. Confederate attacks would dislodge the Union forces, and they retreated to Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill south of the town. From there, they held out against repeated Confederate assaults. In a last-ditch assault known as "Pickett's Charge," Lee sent 12,000 men against the Union forces arrayed at Cemetery Ridge. After suffering bombardment and fierce close-quarters-combat, the Confederate attack was repulsed with heavy losses on both sides. The Confederate forces withdrew back into Virginia, and the Battle of Gettysburg proved to be both the most decisive, and bloodiest, battle of the war. Lincoln commemorated Gettysburg as a national cemetery, a distinction it retains to this day as one of the nation's historic battlefields. His famous Gettysburg Address is one of the most recognizable texts in American history. <br><br>
The very next day following the battle, the Confederacy was handed another and arguably even more decisive defeat at the Siege of Vicksburg. Vicksburg was the last major Confederate holdout on the Mississippi River, and had been besieged for almost two months. The man leading the campaign on the Union side, Ulysses S. Grant, would successfully force the surrender of the town. The Confederates, who by that point were severely malnourished and suffering from starvation, agreed to Grant's terms. Grant offered them parole, being unable to accommodate the 30,000 starving Confederate soldiers. They returned to the South and would go on to oppose Grant during his invasion of Tennessee. Despite this, Vicksburg proved to be a massive strategic victory for the Union, cleaving the Confederacy in two and ultimately dooming it once and for all. <br><br>
Later in July, riots broke out over the draft. Both the Confederacy and the Union had resorted to drafting to make up for their manpower losses, and this resulted in severe anger among immigrant communities, particularly the Irish. In New York City, many immigrants had been coerced into voting in local politics, ignorant of the fact that this made them eligible for the draft. Furthermore, immigrants were resentful of freed blacks, who they saw as unnecessary competition for unskilled labor jobs. This resentment boiled over and turned into a massive riot. Stores were looted, buildings were burned, police stations were ransacked, and many black freedmen were murdered. The riots were put down only with the intervention of the US Army. <br><br>
In 1864, Grant was made the commander of all US armies<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18ehz3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18ehz3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18ehz3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">General Meade was not technically removed from command of the Army of the Potomac, but Grant exercised direct command over the army as Meade's superior. So much so that most people just refer to Grant in command for the last leg of the war and forget about Meade after Gettysburg</span>. He formulated a strategy of total war, seeking to destroy the will to fight of the South by completely annihilating its economic base. To this end, he sent William Tecumseh Sherman on a "march to the sea," with his forces ravaging Georgia by burning plantations, freeing slaves, taking food, and looting houses. Meanwhile, Union forces advanced from the west through Alabama, and another force moved in from the north to occupy Virginia. The most significant Confederate resistance was in Virginia, where Robert E. Lee still commanded a large force. <br><br>
Lee fought a dogged resistance against the advancing Union army, inflicting massive casualties on the Union forces. Despite this, his men were running out of food, supplies, and manpower, and were constantly forced back. They continued to win battles, but they were losing the war. The final months of 1864 saw successive Confederate defeats at the Battle of Cedar Creek and the Battle of Nashville, the latter of which effectively ending any hope of stopping Sherman's march. Union forces pushed closer to Richmond, and Sherman turned northward, marching from Savannah through the Carolinas in an effort to tighten the noose around Robert E. Lee's army. <br><br>
Lee, seeing his position around the capital was indefensible, abandoned Richmond and marched to Appomattox, where his tired, hungry, and undersupplied men would be able to reequip and prepare for another campaign. Grant maneuvered ahead of Lee, however, and totally surrounded his forces. With nowhere left to run and very nearly the entire South open for Union occupation, Lee opted to give up the ghost and surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House. Just a few days later, President Lincoln was shot at the Ford's Theater by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. Lincoln never got to see the end of the war, which came by the end of April with the last few Confederate holdouts surrendering. He did, however, live to see the end of slavery, with Congress passing the Thirteenth Amendment that officially made involuntary servitude illegal <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19bp1j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19bp1j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19bp1j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with prisons being the only exception</span>.

<p>This was the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">civil war in just a century</a> to tear North America&#146;s families, towns, and governments apart. Nationalism had truly developed since then and where before people had largely been torn between ideals, people were now divided just as much if not more by State and local loyalties, for &#145;National&#146; nationalism (i.e. a federal-government-level "USA" national identity) had yet to supersede these. It was for their States and for Freedom that, as in the English Civil War, about 2&#150;5% of the total population of the United States died and far more were left impoverished, displaced, maimed and traumatized. Again as in the Revolution, the victory of the government was almost guaranteed; but no world powers aided the unsympathetic cause of these rebels, who were left to face the far superior manpower, finance, and industry of the central government on their own. The result was almost inevitable. While the whole affair <em>appeared</em> a very close-run thing, especially given the rebels&#146; early successes, the U.S. Army learned (however slowly) from its mistakes and made good on its material advantage, grinding the rebels down and eventually crushing them after four years of the bloodiest fighting North America has ever seen. The rebels &#151; the Confederacy &#151; still engender sympathy in certain states, generally those that rebelled and in some (but not all) border states (Delaware and most of Maryland, for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">would prefer that you even forget that they were ever seen as Southern</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2005e9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2005e9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2005e9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Delaware in particular hates being reminded of this, and Delawareans (all five of them) like to distract people from this historical fact by stressing that when the NAACP ran its full-court press against racial segregation in schools in the series of cases that eventually led to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, the Delaware courts were the only state courts to agree that the practice was unconstitutional.</span> while Kentuckians are perfectly comfortable as firm Southerners; Missouri is more mixed, in keeping with its reputation as a nether-here-nor-there Southern-Midwestern hodgepodge). Such people often prefer to think that the rebels fought for &#145;Freedom from the Tyranny of Central Government&#146; more than &#145;The Freedom to Own and Use People as They Saw Fit.&#146; This was the American Civil War, <em>The War of the Rebellion</em>, the <em>War Between the States</em>, the <em>War of Southern Treason</em>, the <em>War of Northern Aggression</em>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21py0h');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21py0h" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21py0h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is a strange name for the war considering that the Confederates <em>fired the first shot</em> in a blatantly aggressive move on Fort Sumter. But then, <a class="urllink" href="https://deadconfederates.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/googletrendswarofnorthernagression.png">it is a comparatively new name, having only gained popularity since the 1950s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> - coincidentally when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> started making very successful traction. Make of that what you will.</span> <em>Lincoln&#146;s War</em>, the <em>Slaveholders&#146; Revolt</em>, <em>The War for Southern Independence</em> and the <em>Late Unpleasantness</em> &#151; though rarely, if ever, referred to by any of those names while the war itself was being fought.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note229wr6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note229wr6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note229wr6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At the outset some Secessionists referred to their cause as the Second American Revolution, a term that would later be used by others for the entire era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Outside the United States, the preferred term is usually American Civil War or, e. g. in France and Germany, (American) War of Secession.</span> It was an era which pitted brother against brother, and where the armies of the Blue and the Gray shot cannons and Mini&eacute; Balls at each other across smoke-filled battlefields. <br><br>
In actuality, Lincoln at first refused to make freeing the slaves a Union war aim. Doing so would have made the border states (slave states that stayed in the Union) leave. This was particularly important not only for propaganda reasons but also military strategy (Kentucky and Missouri were very useful) and the very pragmatic reason that Washington, D.C. was surrounded by Virginia (a Confederate state) and Maryland (a border slave state). When the mood was right, he presented the abolition of slavery (in <em>only those states which were in rebellion</em>) as a means of critically undermining the rebel war effort. Two years previously by this time, Benjamin Butler, an Abolitionist lawyer-turned-general, had made his major contribution to the war effort by declaring he claimed three slaves who had been used to dig trenches on the grounds they were contraband of war, and then expanding that legal fiction to encompass any slave, whom the Union then emancipated on the grounds they didn&#146;t want them; since even the most diehard racist and pro-slavery advocate who supported the Union could see the logic of seizing rebel slaves, the legal fiction was so widespread that escaped slaves were (and are) habitually referred to as contraband. The Emancipation Proclamation merely declared it a universal matter; it was ostensibly written as a war measure that only freed slaves in rebel-held areas, where public opinion didn&#146;t matter much.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23yhgp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note23yhgp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23yhgp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It is <em>not</em> a question of the fact that the Proclamation only applied to rebelling states; there was plenty of land in rebelling states held by Union forces, and since the Proclamation was a military order, they were the ones expected to enforce it. The arrival of Union troops in any place in the rebelling South meant freedom for the slaves in that area. Moreover, it also meant that any slave who escaped and successfully crossed Confederate lines and met up with Union troops would automatically be considered free &#151; a <em>huge</em> incentive for slaves who heard about the Proclamation to run away the minute a Union force came anywhere near them. Furthermore, the Union had good practical reasons to welcome them: for instance, they were often a valuable source of intelligence of the local area.</span> But by the end of the war, the national mood shifted, and Lincoln helped pass the Thirteenth Amendment that completely ended the institution. Emancipation also had the effect of making British and French public opinion &#151; already wary about the Confederacy &#151; turn decisively in favor of the Union, essentially making recognition of the Confederacy politically unthinkable. <br><br>
Debates raged in the North about how best to deal with reunification. Radical Republicans argued for harsh punishments to be levied against the South, including removing the right to vote. In the end, very few Southerners lost the right to vote or hold office, resulting in many elected officials being Confederate sympathizers. About 4 million black Americans were freed as a result of the war, and the following period known as the Reconstruction would see certain rights and liberties extended to them, including citizenship and the right to vote. However, there was significant resistance to the Reconstruction policies. The Republicans debated on whether to extend the right to vote to all freedmen, and although they flirted with the idea of imposing literacy tests, in the end the Fourteenth Amendment gave the right to vote to all black males above the age of 21. Thousands of freedmen would go on to hold office in the South, largely due to the new black vote eclipsing the vote of bitter Southerners, who refused to participate in the political system. Gradually, however, the pendulum would sway back the other direction, with fewer and fewer blacks holding office in the South as whites started to participate in elections once more. This led to the imposition of restrictions on blacks, such as the infamous Jim Crow Laws, that were meant to keep them socially and economically separate from whites. Resistance also took on violent forms, with infamous White Supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan lynching blacks throughout the South. The Klan would be put down through military force, but eventually it sprang up again in the 1920s, and unfortunately continues to this day. <br><br>
Racism, of course, was not solved by the war. Many Northerners still held racist viewpoints, even many abolitionists. While some abolitionists advocated for equality between blacks and whites, many more still saw blacks as inferior, and that they deserved the "guiding hand of [white] civilization" to help uplift them. Racism was an enduring issue throughout the country, and as mentioned in the draft riots, it was also bad among immigrant communities, who saw the influx of freed blacks to the North as unneeded competition. Race riots occurred from the end of the war well into the 20th century. Despite the efforts of several historical events (the most notable one being the Civil Rights Movement), racism continues to be a contentious issue today. <br><br>
Four years long, the Civil War was by far the most protracted of the early industrial wars;<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24f86b');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24f86b" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24f86b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">&#147;Industrial war&#148; is defined as a war between modern, industrialized countries using mass-mobilization and -production techniques.</span> none of the other industrial wars of this period, save the Crimean and Boer Wars, lasted more than three years. Though several of those conflicts were more expensive in absolute terms, <em>none</em> was &#145;relatively&#146; more expensive or illustrated quite so well the crippling effect of protracted industrial warfare upon an economy and society.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25um33');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25um33" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25um33');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even, if not &#145;especially&#146;, in those parts not directly affected by the fighting: inflation affects everyone.</span> The Austro-French War in Piedmont-Sardinia/Northern Italy, the Russo-Turkish War, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar">Franco-Prussian War</a>, the Second Boer War, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 all give certain (and <em>better</em>) insights into &#145;modern&#146; warfare at the time, however, as they involved The Great (and second-rate) Powers of the age. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrimeanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrimeanWar">The Crimean War</a> (1853&#150;56) is often contrasted with and seen as a smaller-scale precursor to the American Civil War &#151; Russia was about as under-industrialized relative to the Franco-British (and Piedmont-Sardinian) alliance as were the USA&#146;s rebel states to its loyal ones. <br><br>
Of course, at the time it was no easier than usual to tell <em>which</em> lessons could/should be learned from the war. It was very hard to draw conclusions from the limited reports of the time, as it has taken <em>generations</em> to compile a thorough account of the war in all its details. That&#146;s not even mentioning the &#145;benefit&#146; of hindsight or the fact that the horrible casualty records of almost all of the US Civil War battles, on both sides (a lot of which had the defending side digging trenches), still exist and can be found. <br><br>
Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, this war was waged on battlefields but won in factories; the highly industrialized North could mass-produce muskets, cannon, and ships that the agrarian South could only import, and largely couldn&#146;t in large numbers with the Union <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade">Naval Blockade</a> in place. Also, this war had the first recorded successful sinking of an enemy ship by a submarine, and they did it <em>completely blind</em>. And the first battle between two fully-armored ships, CSS <em>Virginia</em> (a &#145;casement&#146; ironclad built on the hull of a partially-destroyed wooden warship, and often known by that warship&#146;s former name, the <em>Merrimac</em>) and USS <em>Monitor</em> (founder and namer of its class, first all-iron ship, first rotatable gun turret) at Hampton Roads. The two shot at each other for <em>three hours</em>, and neither took any appreciable damage whatsoever. Naval forces of the world took note: From now on, their ships needed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> &#133; and they needed some bigger guns.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note268ya7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note268ya7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note268ya7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For instance, a rare case of military leadership actually comprehending the ramifications of a new technology can be found in the British Navy's response to the formal accounts of the battle: All contracts for the production of sail powered wooden ships were immediately terminated, and all such ships under construction at that time scrapped. Britain's shipwrights began drafting what would become the <em>Devastation</em> class coast-defence battleships, the prototype for modern battleships and destroyers.</span> <br><br>
Current estimates are that about 2% of the country&#146;s population was killed, a scale of suffering unknown to the Anglosphere since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a> (which killed 7%) but which put the relative and absolute suffering quite comfortably below that of the Qing Empire&#146;s Taiping Rebellion (which killed 5%).

The costs of the war &#151; not just the immediately obvious ones like having to pay for raising and maintaining massive standing armies<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note308cj0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note308cj0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note308cj0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Indiana, by itself, gave the Union 126 infantry regiments, 26 artillery batteries, and 13 cavalry regiments (i.e. about 150,000 troops) out of a population of less than 1.4 million.

Some regions took generations to recover; some maintain that part or even all of the South <em>still</em> hasn&#146;t recovered from the War (specifically Sherman&#146;s March to the Sea), but these claims hold varying degrees of water. Some of the more dramatic statements about postwar former rebel states suffering at the hands of the central government<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note313j4n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note313j4n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note313j4n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">&#145;We ain&#146;t NEVER recovered from them damnyankees!&#146;</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">basically ignore subsequent economic development over the next century and a half to the order of a several-hundred-percent increase in GDP</a>, not to mention the huge advances in general quality of life. Now leave it at that. We mean it. <br><br>
Admittedly, the Civil War took a larger toll upon the Southern states of the American Union, where most of the war was fought. Not only was property destroyed, but more importantly a lot of <em>wealth</em> disappeared virtually overnight; wealth in the form of Confederate government bonds and currency &#151; which became worthless when the Confederacy was dissolved in &#146;65 &#151; and perhaps most importantly slaves, who were declared free by the Federal Government as a means of sabotaging the Confederate war effort. Slavery had shaped the southern economy for decades, the profitable and dependable returns from investing in slave-picked cotton discouraging investment in other forms of agriculture, raw-resource gathering, primary and secondary industries. As the Industrial Revolution picked up speed, the economic &#145;sideshows&#146; of industry and commerce turned out to be far more profitable than agriculture ever could or would be. The South had been prosperous, but by the 1850s the central-northern United States had become <em>more</em> prosperous and were growing at a dramatically faster rate. What the war did was destroy much of the wealth of the South and force a fundamental restructuring in its economy. Thus the South largely lagged behind the rest of the United States until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">New Deal</a> and the advent of the more balanced economy of the &#147;New South&#148; in the mid-twentieth century. The southern states were neither impoverished nor left backward (relative to the rest of the entire world except Britain, the Low Countries, Scandinavia, and northern France) by the Civil War. But the war did leave them struggling to adapt to a more &#133; <em>normal</em> state of economic affairs, something that would have been difficult even had there been a smoother and more gradual end to slavery (a virtual impossibility in any case). <br><br>
Very unusually, a large portion of the battlefields are preserved in national parks, and, after a concerted effort by the U.S. National Parks Service in the 1990s, most have been almost entirely restored to their appearance in the 1860s. Unlike practically any other place (or for any other war) on Earth, it is possible to visit a very significant portion of all the war's battlefields, and have a reasonable possibility of experiencing <em>exactly</em> what the combatants saw (well, exactly, other than the legions of enemy troops). Combined with an extensive preservation and historical research community (and a huge commitment from the U.S. government to support it), the U.S. Civil War is perhaps the best-preserved war in history. Not just U.S. history, but world history. It borders on obsessive, especially for a nation that came this close to self-immolation. Said parks have been the location setting for many (if not most) of the historical and fictional films about the period, which gives a whole new meaning to the phrase &#145;on location.&#146; Furthermore, if you wish to buy a mid-19th century musket-rifle the two most available are the 1853 Enfield and 1861 Springfield because almost all of the Springfields and over half of the Enfields ever made were used during the American Civil War and a lot of the surviving ones are in American civilian hands. <br><br>
Finally, it spawned two of the greatest speeches ever uttered, both by the same man, Abraham Lincoln: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address">the Gettysburg Address<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (pure distilled Awesome in two minutes) and his <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_Second_Inaugural_Address">Second Inaugural Address<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (an eloquent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>).

<hr><p></p><h1><strong>The Civil War in Fiction</strong></h1>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common themes&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
In the 1910s, around the 50th anniversary of the war, Civil War films (then silent) became extremely popular, with hundreds being produced, including the (in)famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915">The Birth of a Nation</a></em>. Most films had a theme of reconciliation; a film about the Civil War that did not portray Southerners as heroic victims (as did <em>Birth of a Nation</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em>) risked having no audience or bookings in the states of the old Confederacy. Most early Hollywood studio bosses were first- and second-generation European immigrants, so they had no personal association with the war to motivate them to make movies that automatically write off a fifth or a quarter of all theater screens before the production even began. As such most films about the Civil War, Confederate and Union, avoided discussing slavery or the war's true causes. These <em>started</em> to fade after the 100th anniversary of the war (the 1960s), but can still be found.
<p><strong>Several tropes therefore became standard in older Civil War movies:</strong>
</p><ul><li> Other than Quantrill&#146;s Raiders (Missouri guerrillas whose ranks include Jesse James, the Dalton Brothers, and other famous outlaws) rebel soldiers are almost always shown as heroic and respectable. Where individual rebels were villainous, there would be noble rebels around as contrast. Rebel officers are gentlemen, rebel enlisted men are tough, have thicker accents, but are very loyal to their officers.
</li><li> Rebel soldiers are superior to the U.S. Army&#146;s soldiers in every way. They are braver, cleverer, nobler, and just more tragic. Battles where the Union showed innovative strategy (such as Vicksburg) are forgotten or given a one-off mention in favor of showing battles that &#145;prove&#146; they only used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>. This occurs even if the Army&#146;s soldiers are the heroes of the movie or episode.
</li><li> Union soldiers and politicians are thuggish and venal. If motivation is brought up, they are likely to wonder why they are in the army, and why there is even a war going on.
</li><li> &#145;Race&#146; theory and slavery are seldom, if ever, mentioned. If slaves are involved in the plot at all, some or all of them will be loyal to their masters, and there is often a &#145;Loyal Slave&#146; scene in which they protect the family home from Yankee invaders or aid their masters to outwit the Yankees or escape them. There may even be a one-off scene where Southern generals or gentlemen sit down and have a talk about how the war is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">definitely</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">not</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">about slavery</a>.
</li><li> Quite often there might be a specific 'Slave Denial' scene. In this scene a slave or slaves is questioned about slavery, asked to turn against their masters, or offered their freedom &#151; and they turn it down, often with a simple silent denial. This scene turns up in Civil War epics made as recently as the 1980s (the TV miniseries <em>North and South</em>)!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> is often smeared with the number of victims in battles under his command as well as his drinking vastly exaggerated. Modern historians have a more positive view of him, but cultural depictions have not yet caught on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> on the other hand is almost never portrayed entirely negatively even in the most Southern apologist works.

Confederate generals have a discussion around a campfire with a British lieutenant observer about how the war is not about slavery. Various Union commanders discuss whether they are out to free the slaves, or preserve the Union, or if they don't even know why they're fighting any more. An extremely faithful adaptation of the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKillerAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKillerAngels">The Killer Angels</a></em> by Michael Shaara.
<ul><li> The prequel novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodsAndGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodsAndGenerals">Gods and Generals</a></em> (by Shaara's son Jeff) was also adapted into a movie (with the same name), and takes the audience from the beginning of the war to the battle of Chancellorsville. It wasn&#146;t as well-received, partly because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenceHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenceHistory">liberties it took with history</a> in order to present Stonewall Jackson as progressive (for a Confederate) on racial matters.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32i4db');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note32i4db" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32i4db');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> For starters, Jackson's cook was not a free Black, but a slave he rented from his owner. The film also has Jackson suggesting in 1862 that the South might eventually give slaves freedom in exchange for fighting for the Confederacy; in actual fact, the idea was first vented by Irish-born General Pat Cleburne &mdash; who was able to think outside the box because he did not come from the Southern political and military establishment &mdash; a year later, and even in 1863 his superior told him that the idea was unthinkable and that he should keep quiet about it.</span> It also very much tries to gloss over the importance the slavery question had in parts of the North<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33sbfe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note33sbfe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33sbfe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is particularly egregious due to the prominence given to Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who is presented as if he had never even given a thought to the matter prior to joining the army. One would not believe that he came from Maine, one of the few states where Blacks had the vote in 1860.</span>, partly by dint of leaving out the battle of Antietam (which also avoids having to show Jackson fighting in a battle his army lost) and the Emancipation Proclamation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorDundee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorDundee">Major Dundee</a></em>: A <em>Civil War Western</em> epic by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamPeckinpah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamPeckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>. Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners ally to battle the Apaches. The Black soldiers are brave and noble, the Southerners more gallant and skillful than Northerners, and, of course, the Union commander, nominally the hero, is mainly motivated by cynical ambition.
</li><li> <em>The Horse Soldiers</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a> is the hero as a Union cavalryman (an expy of Benjamin Grierson, an actual historical character<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34lnkz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note34lnkz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34lnkz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> however, the film's Colonel Marlowe is an engineer in civilian life; Grierson actually was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">music teacher</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">hated horses</a> ever since he had been kicked and almost killed by one when he was eight</span>) but spends most of the movie running away from his enemies. Since Grierson&#146;s mission was behind-the-lines raiding, not fighting, his actions were considered a great military achievement at the time. What is telling, of course, is that this tale of Union soldiers running away from Confederates was virtually the only Civil War battle detailed in a major Hollywood movie or television show over the first sixty years of the sound era. It features a heroic Confederate charge, complete with streaming flags, a brave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Southern Belle</a>, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">loyal slave servant</a>, and at one point Wayne&#146;s entire command is routed by a battle line of boys from a Mississippi military school! The two leading characters for the Union, played by Wayne and William Holden, are both war-hating pacifists.
<ul><li> The incident with the Mississippi schoolboys described above is both a heartwarming moment and an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, since Grierson/Wayne decided to have his troops deliberately retreat rather than risk a slaughter of the children. This incident in question may not have actually happened during Grierson&#146;s raid: it may owe something to the real-life Battle of New Market in 1864, when the student body of the Virginia Military Institute played a key part in the defeat of a numerically superior Union force.
</li><li> Director John Ford subverted many tropes, though. For instance, the loyal slave servant (Althea Gibson) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ends up</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shot dead by a Confederate bushwhacker</span> for her pains) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Southern Belle</a> trope turns into comedy where the ladies of Newton Station throw dirt at the Yankee cavalrymen, dirtying themselves in the process. It also turns out that one of Marlowe/Wayne&#146;s men (played by Ford stalwart Hank Worden) knows the area from the time before the war when he helped slaves escape on the Underground Railroad, and a couple of Confederate deserters (who by their very existence counter the trope of always honorable Southern soldiers) boast about their shooting prowess and then mention the time when one of them shot a female runaway slave right between the eyes. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">schoolboys&#146; action</a> is played not as heroic, but equal parts tragedy (there&#146;s a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> moment when a mother begs the commander to spare her one surviving son and not take him into battle with him) and comedy (the little drummer boy then runs away from home<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35xbwn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note35xbwn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35xbwn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Does this imply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">only ignorant children would want to seek martial glory</a>?</span> to rejoin his comrades, but is captured by the Northerners who let him go after giving him a spanking). Also, the briefing with Grant and Sherman at the beginning makes it clear that the Marlowe/Wayne&#146;s raid is part of the operations that resulted in one of the great victories of the North, the taking of Vicksburg, and the brigade handsomely wins the two fights against grownup Confederates that it cannot avoid.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the film that put Hollywood on the map: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915">The Birth of a Nation</a></em>.

Blondie survives one impromptu hanging when cannon fire from a nearby battle distracts Tuco and allows him to escape. Angel Eyes eventually sets himself up as a minor Union officer running a brutal prison camp while his maimed superior officer tries and fails to rein him in and angrily compares the place to the similar Confederate camp at Andersonville. Tuco and Blondie run into trouble when they decide to shout cheer for General Lee (they have to take a while to figure out which general&#146;s in charge of the Union army at the moment) at an approaching column of grey-clad soldiers, only to find that they&#146;re Northerners whose blue uniforms have been caked in dust. And both Blondie and Tuco agree to help a Union commander deliberately sabotage his own attack over a strategically-useless bridge by blowing it up. The causes of the war and the motives of its participants are not really discussed, beyond the southern township preparing to hang Tuco listing &#147;consensual intercourse with a woman of the black race&#148; among his crimes, and both sides have their share of sympathetic and unsympathetic characters. What impresses and disturbs the characters most (even &#147;the Bad&#148; in a deleted scene!) is the massive loss of life on both sides.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shenandoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shenandoah">Shenandoah</a></em>: Interestingly for a movie made in the sixties, neither side is displayed particularly flatteringly. It&#146;s about a (West) Virginian who, while personally opposed to slavery, mostly just wishes both sides would just leave him, his farm, and his family alone, which unfortunately for him is not really a tenable position for someone in that time and place. The film's main character, Charlie Anderson, is often cited as an example of a modern Libertarian, with his opposition to slavery and war in general, as well as his indifference to the government (when a Confederate officer tries to recruit his sons, telling him "Virginia needs all her sons", he famously replies "That may be, but these are my sons! They don't belong to the state!"). Interestingly enough, Anderson is played by James Stewart, an Air Force general and a veteran of both the World War 2 and Vietnam.

The author of a book it was based on was an open and self-admitted segregationist and Klansman, so you might think that&#146;s the reason for the portrayal of the Union as monstrous. Nope! In the original book, for instance, Wales&#146; compatriots surrender to the Union in exchange for amnesty without incident. In the movie, they are promised amnesty, then betrayed and massacred by the U.S. Army. And in both book and film, the man who killed Wales&#146; family was a partisan guerrilla rather than an actual Union soldier at the time of the murders.

Shaara&#146;s son Jeff Shaara later wrote a prequel (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodsAndGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodsAndGenerals">Gods and Generals</a></em>) and a sequel (<em>The Last Full Measure</em>). <em>Gods and Generals</em>, which was also turned into a movie that wasn&#146;t as well-received as <em>Gettysburg</em>, depicts the beginning of the war, following Lee, Jackson, Hancock, and Chamberlain from joining their respective sides to late June 1863. <em>The Killer Angels</em> follows Lee, Longstreet, Buford, and Chamberlain through the battle of Gettysburg. <em>The Last Full Measure</em> is post-Gettysburg to Appamattox, and features Lee, Longstreet, Grant, and Chamberlain. Jeff Shaara has also written a tetralogy about other theaters of the war, <em>A Blaze of Glory</em> (about Shiloh), <em>A Chain of Thunder</em> (about Vicksburg), <em>The Smoke at Dawn</em> (about Chattanooga), and <em>The Fateful Lightning</em> (about Sherman&#146;s March to the Sea and the Carolinas Campaign).

The trilogy starts with a Confederate victory at Gettysburg but does <strong>not</strong> result in an overall Confederate victory. Basically, Lee&#146;s victory causes things to be worse than they were in real life, with the butcher&#146;s bill even more staggering for both sides. There&#146;s also a memorable scene where Lee&#146;s assault on Washington, D.C. is bloodily repulsed, with the black troops of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry regiment playing a decisive role.
<ul><li> Crucially, Vicksburg still fell as in our timeline, so Abraham Lincoln appointed Grant to overall command and had him march east earlier, and while the Army of the Potomac is shattered at the Battle of Monocacy (Maryland), the subsequent Battle of Frederick <em>ends</em> the Army of Northern Virginia as an offensive force, and Grant is more successful than our timeline&#146;s Meade in preventing Lee&#146;s eventual escape.

He is pursued by a black time-traveller who then has to see that history stays on course despite being hampered by 1860s racial prejudices.

</li><li> <em>Lincoln</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a>, a novel from his American Chronicles series. Begins with Lincoln's arrival in Washington after his election and ends with his assassination. The story of the Civil War is shown as seen from the national capital, but not just from the perspective of Lincoln and his collaborators, but also e. g. from that of Booth's co-conspirator David Herold.
</li><li> <em>Freedom</em> by William Safire. A rather unwieldy novel that takes the reader from the beginning of the Civil War to the Emancipation Proclamation, mostly from the points of view of Lincoln, his secretary John Hay, his Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, publicist Anna Ella Carroll, and Kentucky politician-turned-general John C. Breckinridge in 1248 pages. With an additional 190-page "Underbook" in which Safire helpfully details where he got his information, what it historical fact, and what is pure invention in every chapter.

Her brother Sam fights for the Union in the war after his own escape.

</p><ul><li> The Civil War has been a fertile ground for tabletop wargames. One of the very first commercial tabletop wargames was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AvalonHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AvalonHill">Avalon Hill</a>'s <em>Gettysburg</em>. Hundreds have followed in it's wake.

Thanks to the developments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>, it&#146;s also far bloodier than it ever was in real life. Chainguns, zeppelins, poison gas &#133; and that&#146;s <em>before</em> we get into the monsters (like undead amalgamations of corpses, zombie soldiers, corpse-eating wolf-things, and sentient clouds of poison gas) that are haunting the battlefields.

</p><ul><li> The musical <em>The Civil War</em> with music by Frank Wildhorn, nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1999, portrays the Civil War through Union, Confederate, and slaves&#146; perspectives in a collection of vignettes. The musical&#146;s story is derived largely from contemporaneous letters, diaries, and firsthand accounts as well as from the words of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and Walt Whitman.

J. Cashier, who was [[Main/Transgender assigned female at birth but lived as a man]]. The Young Albert sections take place when he was serving in Company G of the 95th Illinois Regiment from 1862 to 1865.

The game, while itself fun, however, has numerous instances of wildly inaccurate dates, such as the game taking place in 1880, but claiming that the Civil War ended ten years prior, when it actually ended fifteen years prior. That&#146;s not even getting into the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">rather stupid errors</a> regarding date inconsistency in the game.
</li><li> <em>The History Channel: Civil War &#151; A Nation Divided</em> is an Activision first person shooter set in the Civil War, where players can choose to play on either side in many major battles.
