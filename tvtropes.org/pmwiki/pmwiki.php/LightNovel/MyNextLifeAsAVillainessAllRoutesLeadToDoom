Her parents' marriage for one.</li><li> Part of why Sophia likes Catarina so much is because she leapt out of a tree and scared away a bunch of kids about to start bullying her. She thinks Catarina was being a gallant hero, but she had only climbed the tree to escape a dog and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">needed to get to a bathroom</a> <em>as soon as possible</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: The manga removes or brushes over chapters in the light novel. Most of these instances have different characters' points of view but some plot-important events are given little detail, like Catarina's parents fixing their strained relationship (the <em>Verge of Destruction</em> spin-off oddly enough shows a version of this event play out).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>:<ul><li> The anime shows the events leading up to Catarina reawakening her memories in the first episode, which also contains an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> by Alan.</li><li> Episode 3 includes extra scenes with Sophia and Nicol, with one scene at the tea party highlighting the annoyance the latter feels about people seeing him as pitiful for protecting his often bullied sister.</li><li> Episode 7 adds an entire original segment involving the first year students going through a dungeon for an exam. This segment allows several of the characters to show off their magical and mental skills, along with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> heavily hinting at the use of dark magic, and thus Sirius' eventual antagonist role, before it comes to pass officially.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationRelationshipOverhaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationRelationshipOverhaul">Adaptation Relationship Overhaul</a>: An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example. Catarina remembering her past life causes some character relationships to be different from the original <em>Fortune Lover</em> game, mostly involving how other characters see her, but also relationships she's no part of:<ul><li> In <em>Fortune Lover</em> it's implied that Catarina likes Geordo, but Geordo doesn't like her back, and only keeps their betrothal as a convenient shield to keep other girls at bay. Here, Geordo is genuinely in love with her.</li><li> Catarina originally bullied and tormented her adoptive brother Keith for most of his childhood. Due to her radically different treatment of him, Keith ends up falling in love with Catarina.</li><li> Catarina in the game also bullied Maria at any opportunity. Now, she defends Maria from bullies, and is on very good terms with her. Maria appears to be in love with Catarina as well.</li><li> Similarly, Maria could fall in love with either Geordo, Keith, Alan or Nicol. Now she doesn't show any hints of being attracted to any of them, and none of them display any romantic interest towards her in return, since all of them are in love with Catarina.</li><li> Due to barely appearing in Alan and Nicol's routes, Catarina had no relationship with neither Alan, Nicol, Mary or Sophia. Now she's friends with all of them, and all four of them are in love with her, <em>especially</em> Mary.</li><li> Alan and Mary are betrothed in the game, and are initially in love with each other. Due to Catarina's unwitting interference, while they're still betrothed, they don't show any romantic feelings for each other, mostly due to being in love with Catarina as seen above.</li><li> Originally, Geordo and Alan had a pretty tense relationship, due to the latter feeling overshadowed by the former's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">talent at seemingly anything</a>. Due to Catarina finding that Geordo is terrified of snakes and sharing said knowledge with Alan, and encouraging Alan to develop his talent for music enough for him to snap out of his self-esteem issues and his reckless need to prove himself, their relationship is much smoother. Due to Alan seeing his own worth, he doesn't develop a rivalry against Maria, who is second on the academy's ranking to enter the Student Council while he's below her, simply content that he's one of the best.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeCut">Age Cut</a>: The anime's opening includes a montage of short scenes showing Catarina and one of the other members of the cast as children, then cutting to the two of them as teenagers, often performing the same activity as their child selves. For example, Sophia's scene has her and Catarina holding a book up over their heads while starting to read it. The book then gets tilted down by the teenage version of the pair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a>:<ul><li> This story is an alternate version of that of the otome game <em>Fortune Lover</em>, where Catarina regained her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories">Past-Life Memories</a> after hitting her head on a rock seven years before the period covered by the game. In her efforts to avoid her "doom flags" Catarina unwittingly created a ripple effect that ultimately changed the personalities and dynamics of the game's main cast and indirectly improved the outlook of others such as her parents, Maria's mother and the Claes family gardener, Tom.</li><li> The <em>Verge of Destruction</em> spinoff in turn is an alternate take on <em>this</em> story, with Catarina's fateful head-bump occurring only early into the <em>Fortune Lover</em> timeline (and in the middle of bullying Maria, no less), meaning she had an <em>even shorter</em> timetable to avert her fate. (The first head-bump still happened seven years beforehand, but it didn't bring Catarina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories">Past-Life Memories</a> back.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>:<ul><li> Catarina is engaged to Geordo both in the game and during the plot of the story. The inciting incident remains the same: Catarina has an accident which causes a scar on her forehead. In the game's timeline, Geordo became disdainful of being forced into the engagement, and the only reason he has yet to break it off was because it acted as a barrier from girls, and he figured that Catarina would be adequately attractive and nothing more. The story's Catarina accidentally gets engaged to him because she wasn't paying attention to the conversation at the time. However, Geordo quickly falls in love with the new Catarina and insists that the scar hasn't faded so the engagement can't be called off. In <em>Verge of Destruction</em>, it follows the game until Catarina tries to break off the engagement herself, and Geordo refuses because he still wants Catarina as a shield.</li><li> Mary is also engaged to Alan in both the original game and the story. The difference is that in the story, Catarina ends up unwittingly winning both their hearts, so when Alan realizes his feelings and tries to break off his engagement to Mary, he discovers Mary will absolutely not allow him to break the engagement and let him have free rein to pursue a woman she also loves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeBeforeEntering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeBeforeEntering">Axe Before Entering</a>: Early in the story, Keith ends up hurting Catarina with his magic and locks himself in his room out of fear of doing so again, even taking the spare key and the master key so no one else can get in. Catarina, worried that this will cause him to follow the path of his game counterpart, tried in vain to get him to open the door by speaking to him. When this fails to work, she decides to take a more direct route in breaking him out of his emotional bubble: grabbing a battle axe and smashing down his door. It works, at the cost of getting a scolding from her mother.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPeopleAbuseAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPeopleAbuseAnimals">Bad People Abuse Animals</a>: Not only did some of Keith's adoptive siblings bully him, but they were also shown throwing stones at a bird for fun in a flashback.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem">Balanced Harem</a>: A perfect example. <em>Fortune Lover</em>'s male love interests, female romantic rivals and the original protagonist all fall in love with Catarina. Of course, Catarina is incredibly clueless because her character was originally the game's villainess, so she thinks it's impossible for any of the other characters to love her instead of their intended love interests. Everyone who loves Catarina has the same amount of focus and interaction with her and Catarina loves hanging out with all of them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">The Beautiful Elite</a>: By accident or design the current student council falls into this, which's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshaded</a> by Catarina when she wonders if they were chosen for their looks as much as their grades; it has two members of royalty, one betrothed to royalty, both children of the sitting prime minister and a ducal heir. Thanks to Catarina's efforts, they fit this trope even better than their <em>Fortune Lover</em> counterparts because most of them are fairly good-natured as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">Because You Were Nice to Me</a>: Most of Catarina's love interests fall for her because they were all bullied or troubled in some way, and Catarina was there to show them kindness and friendship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriendsInLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriendsInLaw">Best Friends-in-Law</a>: Catarina and Mary would be this if they actually had any intention on going through with their engagements to Geordo and Alan.

At first he's pleased at her apparent sudden shyness, but eventually realizes that he's still not really a blip on the radar.

This is in stark contrast to the game's original Catarina, whose relationship with the other characters was distant and frosty at best.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">Christmas Cake</a>: Because she wasn't particularly attractive, the head maid of the Claes family focused too much on work and wasn't good with people, she lost her chance to get married before she knew it.

At one point she asks herself why of all the rival characters only Catarina ended up exiled or dead on all routes involving her, but it becomes clear when she doesn't act like the original Catarina that the answer is because the original never did anything kind or sympathetic. Since that's basically all the new Catarina does, she's saved herself from every bad ending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except Sirius'</span> within about a week of first regaining her memories.</li><li> Catarina basically never gets the point when anyone is in the slightest bit indirect. Like when Mary is talking about how difficult it is to be married to a prince and how she'd much rather run away with Catarina instead, the latter just thinks she's complaining about her own engagement rather than trying to get her to break off the engagement to Geordo. Even when Maria explicitly states that she adores Catarina when asked who she likes, Catarina thinks <em>Maria</em> is the one who missed the point, and is talking about friendship rather than love.</li><li> When Catarina is accused of bullying Maria, her friends argue she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">too dense</a> to have come up with the elaborate plans required. It works, although Catarina doesn't quite get how they managed it, aside from a vague sense she's being badmouthed that she forgets about once it's all over.</li><li> She finally meets her match with Selena, who interprets everything Catarina does as brave stoicism rather than sheer stupidity and indifference and then comes to view Catarina's friendliness as the kindness and forgiveness of a saint rather than oblivious affection.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>: In the first story in the anthology, during which everyone is demonstrating how their magic can help with Catarina's farming, Keith brings up that his earth golems would increase manpower.

After believing that the ritual went correctly as planned and hoping that he would get to return to his family, he was killed by the Marchioness to cover up her tracks. His vengeful spirit still remains though, with hom encouraging Raphael to enact his revenge against their shared nemesis, leading to the conflict of the second volume. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnd">Bad End</a> of <em>Fortune Lover</em>, he finally overpowered Raphael, leading him killing <em>everyone</em>.

However, the first dark magic user who appeared in this series isn't bad at all, all things considered. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is revealed that Raphael is forced to impersonate his half-brother "Sirius Dieke" thanks to a ritual to transfer his half-brother's spirit into his body. The original Sirius had already died, leaving Raphael as the only one in his body, making the ritual a failure. If the marchioness had found out that the ritual had failed, she would have killed him right on the spot. He gained Dark Magic in the process after living as "Sirius" for some time. The only reason why Raphael becomes the antagonist of the second volume is due to the spirit of the dark mage (who was killed by the marchioness after the ritual that granted him dark magic in order to transfer the real Sirius' soul to Raphael's healthier body), amplifying Raphael's anger and grief over losing his mother who became a sacrifice in order to acquire the magic needed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a>.

However, this was the cause of many issues for some of the characters who are the result of said relationships, like Keith being treated badly by his biological father's family due to his mother being a prostitute, Mary's mother being the second wife and getting the cold shoulder from her older half-sisters, Anne being the daughter of a noble and his maid with said father treating her like a pawn and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raphael Walt being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildOfRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildOfRape">Child Of Rape</a> whose noble father forced himself on his mother, a maid</span>.

There does seem to be an underlying assumption that most people are straight, but this only extends to things like Alan not guessing that Mary is a rival or Keith not being entirely sure if Mary loves Catarina or just really likes her as a friend.

Later, when Nicol himself says he's in love with someone "he shouldn't be", she assumes that he is in love with either a married woman or another man. She also assumes that Geordo, Keith, Alan and Nicol are in love with Maria just like in <em>Fortune Lover</em>, which is problematic as Maria is a commoner, and the princes are engaged.

One little mistimed compliment to Mary, for example, has her go from loving Alan with all her heart to considering him an okay friend while instead falling for the evil-rival-turned-new-heroine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourElementEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourElementEnsemble">Four-Element Ensemble</a>: As noted in the manga, the four capture targets of <em>Fortune Lover</em> each represent one of the four classical elements&mdash;Geordo is Fire, Alan is Water, Keith is Earth, and Nicol is Wind&mdash;while Maria, the main character, represents the fifth, rare element of Light, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sirius/Raphael, the secret fifth suitor, represents Darkness</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendZone">Friend Zone</a>: Basically everyone. Alan, Geordo, Maria, Sophia and Mary are all in the friend zone and it doesn't even occur to Catarina how they might feel. Keith is in the brother zone to the point that she can only intellectually acknowledge that he's attractive. Nicol is the odd one out here in that he's more in the "my friend's brother" zone, which means he's less off-limits and more someone she rarely speaks to. However, that slight bit of distance seems to balance out a little in his favor as she seems to be less used to him and more vulnerable to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">gorgeous smile</a> than she is to most of her other suitors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyAddressPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyAddressPrivileges">Friendly Address Privileges</a>: Keith starts off addressing Catarina with "Lady", but she says that is too formal for siblings. She insists on being addressed as "big sister", which he proceeds to do. The light novel reveals that at the home he was at previously, he was not allowed to call his adoptive parents "Mother" and "Father," making his formality understandable and Catarina's gesture all the more significant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGameComeToLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGameComeToLife">The Game Come to Life</a>: From the perspective of "monkey girl", she feels like she's still playing <em>Fortune Lover</em> to some extent, albeit from the perspective of the game's <em>villainous</em> rival character, Catarina Claes. The experience causes her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">sympathize with the game's Catarina</a> and makes her want to file a complaint to the game's production company.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>: The omake for volume 3 of the manga has Catarina dreaming about what gender-flipped versions of the main cast would look like.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a>: It's basically impossible to tell in the manga that Catarina is supposed to be significantly less attractive than Mary or Sophia. Not a top-tier beauty, but not hideous or even plain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Good All Along</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geoffrey Stuart, eldest brother of Geordo and Alan, really loves his brothers&mdash;possibly in squicky ways, but never mind that&mdash;and has no interest in the throne. Everything he does is to keep them safe.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parents</a>:<ul><li> The Claes family are genuinely wonderful people who allow their daughter to live freely as well as making sure she learns what she needs to know, though her mother has a hard time trying to get her to act in accordance with her status. They also treat their adoptive son better unlike in the game, giving him a genuine home for the first time after eight years of torment by the hands of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>.</li><li> The same goes to Sophia and Nicol's parents; in fact, the reason Nicol fell in love with Catarina was because she was the first person to share his belief that he was blessed to have such a loving family. Also, as revealed in the fifth volume of the light novel, both parents don't force their children into arranged marriages, are worried over Nicol's unrequited love for Catarina, and hold concern towards his hurry to get married regardless of what he feels. In fact, Dan Ascart seems to be liberated with views that are unheard of in noble society. He finds arranged marriages to be petty and antiquated and his marriage for Radia was out of love. Furthermore, if Nicol isn't interested in his title, his father can simply adopt someone from their relatives who will inherit the earldom (not unlike Duke Claes' situation of adopting Keith and grooming him to become the future head of the Claes duchy).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a>: While Catarina is almost universally popular, some girls do resent her for seemingly snatching up all the pretty boys, especially Geordo. But given that she's a duchess currently engaged to a prince who might take the throne and surrounded by other highly influential figures, there's not much anyone can do and they don't even bother trying to get back at her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unless they're brainwashed</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairContrastDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairContrastDuo">Hair-Contrast Duo</a>: Geordo and Alan have a gold/silver contrast, reflecting the fact that the latter has always felt like he was only second best.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>: Catarina's parents in the game had a strained relationship due to two major misunderstandings, but an early incident in the story clears up both and leaves them very lovey dovey with each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a>: Played straight when it comes to magic. Training might give a person more control over their magic, but any actual increase in power is negligible at best considering that Catarina spent seven years honing her skills under a personal tutor (something which is noted to be out of the ordinary) and all it did was let her raise the dirt around her by several more centimeters. Indeed, in <em>Verge of Destruction</em>, this fact is one of Sienna's major hangups and the primary reason why she initially hates Maria.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Catarina was this in <em>Fortune Lover</em>, being a thoroughly unsympathetic rival character in Geordo and Keith's routes.

In the main story itself, Catarina unwittingly displaces her as such for doing the same thing years before the game's story starts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">Hero Worship</a>: Some of Catarina's love interests like Sophia seem to half-worship her and at school she gets a reputation for being a saint.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassGloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassGloves">High-Class Gloves</a>: Fancy gloves show up often considering the bulk of the cast are nobility. Catarina wears opera gloves at formal occasions, such as tea parties or her birthday party. As a teenager, her default outfit includes wrist length gloves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">Hostile Show Takeover</a>: The basic premise is that our heroine is in such a panicked rush to avoid her fate as the game's villainess that she ends up becoming the protagonist instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">without ever realizing it</a>.

Her kidnapper is another dark magic user who, unlike the first, genuinely killed someone for their power and feels no remorse for it. However, Catarina finds him cool and interesting and he ends up falling for her as well even though his job clearly would have ended with assassinating her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail">In Spite of a Nail</a>: Catarina gets confronted at the end of the school year for bullying Maria, just like her game counterpart <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to Sirius manipulating the accusers with dark magic</span>. Of course, since Catarina hasn't actually bullied Maria in this timeline, everyone quickly speaks up in her defense.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultMisfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultMisfire">Insult Misfire</a>: Early on in the series Catarina asks Anne why her mother seems so angry at all the time, to which Anne responds that it's probably having to deal with such a difficult child.

Oddly enough, the former is used by people who would be the addressee's equals or even superiors. The localized version replaces the former with appropriate noble or royal titles (for example, Lady Catarina, Prince Geordo and Duke Claes).</li><li> The localization of the light novel uses honorifics for the parts set in Japan. The monkey girl initially calls her friend the formal and polite "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Sasaki-san</a>," before switching to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Acchan</a>," (or "Acchan-sama" when doing particularly exaggerated expressions of gratitude).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeAndReceive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeAndReceive">Joke and Receive</a>: When Mary met Catarina for the first time, her first thought was that she was like she had come from another world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove">Ladykiller in Love</a>: Rufus/Sora has only cared about one person before, a random sick guy who was something like a best friend or father figure.

Catarina knows pretty much every such scenario in <em>Fortune Lover</em>, and does her best to avoid them, as they almost always involve a bad ending for her. In the process, though, she ends up usually turning them into romantic encounters for <em>herself.</em> Ironically, when the actual scenes come, Catarina has unknowingly sabotaged them to the point that they no longer have any impact. For instance, Maria originally met Geordo while climbing a tree, which caused him to strike up a conversation and then learn that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLikeOtherGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLikeOtherGirls">Not Like Other Girls</a>, but when he'd been growing up around Catarina, who climbs trees fairly regularly, he saw it as no big deal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating">Mistaken for Cheating</a>:<ul><li> Keith's introduction causes Catarina's mother Millidiana to believe that her father Luigi cheated on her.

The "monkey girl" was never able to finish Nicol's route before she died, so Catarina doesn't know how it ends.

Whenever Catarina takes the place of the story's heroes in a scene, she realizes what she's done later and chastises herself for stealing their "flag" events. However, she never realizes that this means the person fell for her instead. It gets downplayed in that there's no sex involved, but at the same time it's also exaggerated: Catarina steals the hearts of the game's love interests, rivals, and the heroine herself, effectively NTRing everyone at the same time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATitle">Never Trust a Title</a>: The title of the show is a "lie" on many levels; Catarina may have been reborn into the body of the villainess of a game, but the moment that she regains her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories">Past-Life Memories</a>, any sort of villainy becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">an impossibility for her</a>.

As a result she quickly morphs into the main character, even going so far as to accidentally seduce all the rivals and the former main heroine herself. A few weak attempts seem to be made to put the story back on track but they just drive Catarina even more firmly into the main heroine role.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>:<ul><li> Catarina herself is prone to these constantly. Most of the time, they come after realizing she's just done or said something that might anger or upset someone (especially her mother), but she also has this reaction whenever she comes across an event from the game from one of the routes in which she dies or becomes exiled, which she calls "Doom Flags".</li><li> Catarina has a more serious reaction when the event in which she's accused of bullying Maria seems to play out as in the game, up until Maria denies the accusations. While Catarina has ensured that neither Geordo nor Keith will kill her, she's still worried about a false accusation leading to her exile.</li><li> Unlike the rest of her suitors, there is little in the way stopping Geordo from bedding Catarina. This, combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">subtle implication</a> that he will impregnate her at the first opportunity, has led to almost every other character in Catarina's harem giving this reaction whenever Geordo arranges to be alone with her. At one point, when Keith notices that Geordo didn't arrive at a social gathering, he realizes that Catarina is alone at that moment and rushes to her, and sure enough Geordo was luring her away to a secluded beach. That same instance also had Mary give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFacedAside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFacedAside">Two-Faced Aside</a> after realizing how close she came to losing out to Geordo.</li><li> Some of the students accusing Catarina of bullying Maria panic when Maria offers to name some of her tormentors, implying that some of her bullies are falsely accusing Catarina of what they themselves did.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldTimeyAnkleTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldTimeyAnkleTaboo">Old-Timey Ankle Taboo</a>: When Catarina went to the lake to cool down one summer, a scandalized Geordo and Keith frantically covered each other's eyes when she took off her shoes and lifted up her dress to her knees to play in the shallows.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Two characters, Maria Campbell and Mary Hunt, have very similar first names (since "Mary" is the English form of the originally Latin "Maria").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvercomeWithDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvercomeWithDesire">Overcome with Desire</a>: In episode 8 of the anime, all of the characters except Mary and Maria are sucked into a magical book that grants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeartsDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeartsDesire">the fondest desire</a> of its occupants. Geordo, Keith, Sophia, and Nicol all aggressively try to seduce Catarina, while Mary closes the book on Alan's scene before anything even starts. Catarina, being the impulsive ditz that she is, can only think about eating sweets at that moment, so the book tries to present her with an infinite supply. However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth">it backfires</a> because Catarina can't become full in the book world, and so her hunger only grows stronger and stronger until the book can't take it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">Parents as People</a>: Maria's mother is clearly struggling with the fallout of her daughter discovering a talent for light magic, but is still trying to be a good parent, as well as hostess when Catarina and Keith stop by.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassiveAggressiveKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassiveAggressiveKombat">Passive-Aggressive Kombat</a>:<ul><li> Every single conversation that Keith and Geordo have is dripping with very obvious subtext as they battle for Catarina's attention (e.g. Keith "politely suggests" that Geordo doesn't need to come over so often). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious">Catarina being Catarina</a>, she thinks they are just being close friends.</li><li> It happens with Mary and Keith later during the festival arc.

However, both feel a bit uncomfortable because they think their partner was forced into the relationship. Her father in particular feels guilty because he didn't have the nerve to talk to her himself and instead arranged for her to be married without her consent. Doesn't help too that Millidiana has low opinion to herself. Once they realize that their partner genuinely loves them, however, they become extremely happy and affectionate towards each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life-Partners</a>: Catarina mentions that there is a "Friendship Route" for the game, which is considered a "bad end" by the standards of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceGame">Romance Game</a>, but is the most ideal ending Catarina can think of for herself, since it doesn't involve exile or death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She believes this is the ending she gets at the conclusion of the first school year, naturally oblivious to the fact that everyone is in love with <em>her</em> and not Maria.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty">Plot Tailored to the Party</a>: During the practical exam, the team of Catarina, Geordo, Sophia and Keith all encounter hazards suited to their talents.

Each route has a rival who must be dealt with during the story: Catarina Claes, Geordo's fiancee and Keith's older stepsister; Mary Hunt, Alan's fiancee; and Sophia Ascart, Nicol's younger sister.

Therefore, he doesn't care when Maria places above him in the school standings.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note486rn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note486rn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note486rn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the game, it was Maria outranking Alan that sparks his interest in her.</span></li><li> Finally, Catarina saves Maria from bullies twice, doing the same things her in-game saviors would've done<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ariy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5ariy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ariy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Geordo drives Maria's bullies, of which one group was originally led by Catarina, away, then eats Maria's cupcakes that had fallen on the grass because of the bullies. The second instance was Keith using his magic to protect Maria from the bullies, originally led by Catarina, planning to use magic to hurt Maria</span>, causing Maria to fall in love with her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyGayActivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyGayActivity">Secretly-Gay Activity</a>:<ul><li> The protagonist Catarina Claes forms an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a> of both men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer">and women</a>. Ironically, Catarina herself provides the perfect cover for her female suitors to disguise their advances by creating a Romantic Literature Club. Many of the books in said club (again, of Catarina's own choosing) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">Yuri</a> stories of two girls sharing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenLove">Forbidden Love</a>. These stories not only give Catarina's female suitors a pretext to gush about the beauty and allure of girl-on-girl relationships, but provide the means for them to spend time alone with Catarina. Sophia Ascart is the most blatant example, as she was the one Catarina originally started the club for, and Catarina is later taken aback by <em>how much</em> Sophia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriFan">seems to enjoy yuri stories</a>. In one scene involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a>, Sophia even tries to use her library of romance novels as an excuse to seduce Catarina with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallPinOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallPinOfLove">moves straight out of a yuri scene</a> and convince Catarina to move in with her permanently.</li><li> On a more subtle scale, Catarina's other female suitors (especially Mary Hunt) will use swimming, bathing, cooking and at one point even a possible illness to try and get Catarina alone with them in intimate situations, and directly use the fact that they're "both girls" as an excuse why it's acceptable and why the male suitors won't be allowed to interfere. It still backfires because, as stated, <em>half</em> of Catarina's harem is female, so one girl rarely ever gets to have her to themselves.</li><li> This trope is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> when the girls all have a slumber party together. When the male characters find out and wonder just what girls would do at such a party, Catarina suggests that the boys have one for themselves. All of the boys (except Nicol) are absolutely put-off by the idea, as they can't think of anything boys would talk about for an entire night. However, Sophia (Nicol's little sister) begins imagining what she thinks boys would do in such a position and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOnGuyIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOnGuyIsHot">turns wide-eyed and blushing</a>. Further, during the actual slumber party itself, all of the girls continue flirting with Catarina and dropping subtle hints about their interest in her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries">The Seven Mysteries</a>: The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalBook">Portal Book</a></span> found in the school library is stated to be one of the school's seven mysteries.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTriangle">Sibling Triangle</a>:<ul><li> Geordo and Alan both love Catarina, though Geordo and Mary kept Alan from realizing his own feelings and thus there's no real competition between the two. Yet.</li><li> Sophia and Nicol also both have a thing for Catarina, but in this case Sophia seems to want her brother to marry Catarina so that she can have them both.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a>: In the game, Catarina's parents were distant because of misunderstandings about their arranged marriage and the assumption that Keith was a mistress' bastard child. When this is cleared up, they grow extremely close and affectionate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Spell My Name with an "S"</a>:<ul><li> Depending on whether you read the manga or the light novel (in the official J-Novel translation), the main character is "Catarina" or "Katarina", the third prince is either "Gerald" or "Jeord", and the prime minister's son is "Nicole" or "Nicol". The manga muddles things further with the covers using "Geordo" for the third prince.</li><li> The anime ends up mixing the earlier naming conventions, respectively using "Catarina" (manga), "Geordo" (manga cover) and "Nicol" (light novel).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>:<ul><li> The post-credits scene in Episode 9 shows Catarina <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">confronted by several of her schoolmates, who vow to bring her wicked actions to light. Since Catarina has not committed any of the misdeeds her game counterpart did, she's utterly confused.</span></li><li> The end of Episode 12 of the anime shows Catarina's toy snake being sold at a local shop.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalElite">Supernatural Elite</a>: The ability to use magic is almost exclusively found among the upper class. While it's not unheard of for a commoner to be able to do so, it's so insanely rare that most people just end up assuming that the person's mother must have slept with a nobleman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles">Swapped Roles</a>: There are faint hints that with the rival becoming the new heroine, the others are having their roles switched around too. Geordo is something like the new Catarina with his claims to entitlement to her while Mary and Alan now view each other as worthy rivals to her instead of Maria competing with Mary for Alan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchingPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchingPOV">Switching P.O.V.</a>: The original light novels alternated chapters between Catarina's perspective and whoever she was focusing on at the time, including showing certain scenes from the perspective of the other character. The manga drops all non-Catarina P.O.Vs, which leaves the other characters less developed than they would have been otherwise, while the anime has them as recaps released online.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>: The localization of the light novel does this for the latter half of its title.<div class="indent">Hmm...? That&#146;s a little weird, isn&#146;t it? In the happy endings, she gets chased out of the kingdom and stripped of her title... and in the bad endings, she dies...

All routes lead to doom!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl">Tomboy and Girly Girl</a>: Catarina is the tomboy while her friends Mary, Sophia and Maria are the girly girls. Catarina prefers outdoor activities like gardening, climbing trees and fishing, and she considers dresses too cumbersome for her daily life. Mary is a classical beauty, Sophia loves to read romance novels (as does Catarina) and is gentle and demure, and Maria is very adept at making sweets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">Took a Level in Kindness</a>: Apart from the heroes and heroines, Catarina also has a good effect on the other cast. Her mother, for example, felt her husband didn't love her and views Keith as proof of it, which in the game resulted in her hating him and growing estranged from her husband. However, when this misunderstanding was cleared up she grew to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">very close</a> to her husband, became a nagging mom to Catarina and not only treats Keith like a son, but also supports him marrying her daughter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">Trilogy Creep</a>: The story originally was supposed to end in 2 volumes, now it's 8 volumes and running, plus a spinoff.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: Thanks to Catarina bringing them all together and acting as the glue that holds them, while they fight each other over who will be her lover, every member of the main student cast develops strong bonds with each other beyond their relationship with Catarina. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Maria winds up going missing, every one of them worries about her safety and does their best to find her, not just because her disappearance upsets Catarina, but also because they genuinely care about her as a close friend.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalFinalMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalFinalMessage">Unintentional Final Message</a>: The night before she was killed in her previous life, the "monkey girl" had sent a text message to her best friend Atsuko complaining about the difficulty she was having while playing <em>Fortune Lover</em>. Atsuko wouldn't come across the message for several days (she forgot to bring her phone to school the day of the accident and spent the next several days too depressed to do much of anything). Seeing it helped break her out of her despair and resolve to live her life to the fullest in the hope that they could be reunited in another life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>: Catarina doesn't seek a harem, but gets one anyway. Furthermore, she is so dense she doesn't notice that one is growing around her, of both genders, thinking herself still the villainess.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: Episode 10 significantly increases the stakes by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> Sirius Dieke</span> is the hidden fifth capture target. The monkey girl knows very little about his route apart from the fact that the bad ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">will result in the heroine and all her friends dying</a>. Worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Catarina only discovers Sirius' identity as the capture target after he's kidnapped Maria, and just before he puts her into a coma.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> Early on in the series, shortly after Mary's debut, Keith casually says, "Incidentally, I believe that Lady Mary's engagement to Prince Alan should be settled soon," which is news to both the viewer and Catarina.

But since she's now in the body of one of those villainous characters, she instead brought out the best in everyone and there's barely any gray in the story at all. The darkest character who appears in the present is probably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a blackmailed magician who loved his family but was murdered after it was rubbed into his face that they've been dead all along.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: When Alan has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany">Love Epiphany</a>, he tries to break off his engagement to Mary. However, at this point she begins taking him seriously as a rival and stops trying to break it off on <em>her</em> end. They come to an agreement that there are advantages to being officially engaged to each other but both secretly being interested in the same person. Interestingly, this seems to put Catarina into the hero position, Alan the heroine and Mary the rival. Or perhaps the latter two have their positions reversed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongAssumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongAssumption">Wrong Assumption</a>: Catarina has had many of these since she first realized she's living out the life of an Otome game Villain. She's assumed that everyone will act just like their characters did in the game she remembers. She does not take into account that, since she is making major changes to the lives they lead as children, she also made major changes to who they grew into.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>:<ul><li> Subverted in the first episode. As the credits begin to roll, Catarina discovers to her horror that despite her efforts to prevent Keith from feeling lonely in the future (which indirectly leads to her death), Keith has instead forced himself into isolation for an entirely different reason. As the episode appears to conclude with the lesson that destiny can't be changed no matter what, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Catarina takes a literal axe to that notion</a> and chops down Keith's door, falls to her hands and knees and begs forgiveness for causing Keith pain. The episode then ends with the two becoming closer than ever and revealing its true premise: Catarina has <em>already</em> changed her fate, but she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">too dense to realize it!</a></li><li> Fate has it that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags">Event Flags</a> in <em>Fortune Lover's</em> continuity will play out no matter what: Catarina will always be exposed for her crimes against Maria, Mary's green thumb will always be complimented by Alan, Maria will always be bullied, and so on. However, what changes is the <em>actors</em> in each scene. Catarina often bumbles into saying things other characters were meant to say to someone important before they could, or doing things other characters were supposed to do. This ultimately ends up making it so that more negative scenes are changed in Catarina's favor, since she's often being a genuinely nice person to others, as opposed to the in-game version of Catarina, who was an ass.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeartsDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeartsDesire">Your Heart's Desire</a>: The magical book in the library's east wing pulls people into it and grants their fondest desires. For Geordo, Keith, Sophia and Nicol, their desire was of course Catarina. Alan's desire started with Catarina watching his recital, and Mary ended the scene before it could progress further. For Catarina, the only thing she could focus on at the moment was the fact that she was hungry, and so that was what the book gave her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero-Approval Gambit</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prince Geoffrey pretends to want to be king in order to gather supporters, especially the more unsavory ones, in order to identify and eliminate them as threats to the realm and so he can help support his brothers in their claim for the throne, while he is content with sitting out.</span></li></ul></div><hr>
