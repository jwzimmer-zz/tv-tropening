Only it's anything but. Decrepit and run-down, its rides and attractions are in dire need of maintenance and, what's more, its staff and performers seem to have lost hope that things will become any better. Not exactly a place one would first think about to bring a family to for a weekend of fun and relaxation.</p><p>Except it's not <em>just</em> a park.

The narration from the novels and manga adaptation even note what a nice ass Isuzu has.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPublicConfession">Accidental Public Confession</a>: Moffle gives one in episode 8 while disguised as Seiya. After some friends angrily confront Seiya about his toying with Kanae's heart, thanks to Tiramie when he was wearing the suit the previous day, Moffle apologizes on Seiya's behalf, but the girls don't believe him and call his apology fake. This angers him enough that he goes on a rant about them knowing nothing about love and the suffering it produces. He then spills out his frustration at watching the girl he loved for over ten years getting married to the guy he hated the most. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he says they entrusted their child to him, prompting Isuzu to ask if he was referring to Latifa. Moffle immediately tries to brush it off as a hypothetical scenario.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>: With a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag">Casting Gag</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllisonKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllisonKeith">Allison Keith</a> would bring to mind Melissa Mao from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a> series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>:<ul><li> In full force for the anime, as the studio only adapted a single novel.

The manga and light novel are substantially more provocative.

Hence why its imminent shutdown would be fatal to them. She also tells Seiya that there are other parks that operate in the same fashion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>: Happens in episode 8 after Seiya, or rather, Macaron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">disguised as Seiya</a>, takes a hit from Kimura, a boy at his high school. He gets punched, and plays it off, but the injury is a bit unusual, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in that his head is twisted unnaturally and is upside down. Macaron then fixes his head as if nothing happened.</span> Kimura then runs off after being shocked at said injury.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>: Per his agreement of running the park, Seiya quits being the manager at the end of episode 12 after the July 31st deadline. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Everyone seems depressed at it though, including him. His aunt seems shocked that he quit, and then tells him that he seemed genuinely happy while working there. As Seiya thinks it over, he reconsiders his decision to quit, and goes back the next day, claiming that the park will fall into ruins without his intervention. Despite his claims, everyone is happy he's back, and they all look forward to attracting more visitors as the park opens up for business.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse">An Offer You Can't Refuse</a>: The very first scene of the anime has Isuzu pointing a rifle in Seiya's face telling him to go with her to a theme park. When he doesn't seem interested nor threatened by her, she actually fires a shot which misses him by inches. He is then seen waiting for her at a bus stop in the next scene.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>:<ul><li> The rude family in episode 3. Though Moffle did instigate the fight, Isuzu uses amnesia bullets on the family to make them forget the incident. Seiya also had the encounter recorded secretly, and edited it to make the father appear to be the aggressor in the fight, and have Moffle appear to be only defending himself.</li><li> The brother of Biino Bandou, the girl applying for a job while nursing a stab wound in episode 6. Though he should be locked away in jail for what he did, he seems to have gotten off somewhat easy with a justified beatdown by Moffle.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing">Bad "Bad Acting"</a>: Isuzu's attempt at acting in episode 7, along with the OVA, is noticeably monotone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>: Seiya deliberately invokes this in Episode 2, partly to see how committed the cast still was to their park, and partly to inspire them, albeit in a crude way. His first order of business is to shut the park down for a day and order the cast to fix up their attractions, which doesn't sit well with Moffle. He gradually shifts out of this trope as the show goes on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathOfPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathOfPoverty">Bath of Poverty</a>: Isuzu Sento's apartment doesn't have a bathroom so she had put a clawfoot bathtub in her kitchen that is filled by a hose connected to the sink so she can easily keep up with her 3 baths a day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathtubScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathtubScene">Bathtub Scene</a>: Isuzu is responsible for these in the anime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">Bare Your Midriff</a>:<ul><li> Several of the Elementario girls in their default outfit show this off.</li><li> Isuzu's pirate outfit in episode 7.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Battle Aura</a>:<ul><li> Moffle often creates one just before he punches something out.</li><li> Isuzu does one in episode 7 when Tiramie attempts to make her walk the plank like he had done to Macaron and Moffle.

Macaron and Moffle force him to walk the plank the same way he made them do it earlier. And averted again in episode 12 when the ladies he flirted with show up to beat him up, along with their angry husbands.</li><li> Played straight in episode 8 with Tiramie, Macaron, and Moffle, who took turns wearing a suit resembling Seiya, and making him look like a delinquent (Macaron) and later a two-timing womanizer (Tiramie). Shiina, whom the others ran into at school, is surprised Seiya isn't angry at them for wrecking his reputation. However, he replies that they were helping him out, so he couldn't really get mad at them for that.</li><li> The three boys who continually attack Isuzu throughout the show face no repercussions for assaulting her.

Other than a very obvious giant zipper on top of their head, said characters look completely like the real one. Tiramie manages to fool Seiya by wearing a suit resembling Isuzu (despite Seiya noticing the obvious zipper on 'her' head). They explain that they could help him out by each wearing a Seiya suit so he wouldn't get absentee marks. They even point out that the Isuzu suit is self-produced and they only manage to get her outer layer and not her 'hidden areas', wishing the makers could produce that. Too bad the real Isuzu happens to hear them which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingIntent">doesn't bode well.</a><ul><li> Later, Many people at school point out said zipper, but whoever is wearing the Seiya suit at the time brushes it off as if it were completely normal for him to have that thing on his head. Unfortunately several of the characters end up making things worse for him particularly with their interactions with Kanae.</li><li> At the near end of the episode, Kanime, the boy who liked a girl by the name Kanae and was originally the intended recipient of her's love letter ends up saving Seiya (Moffle in disguise) saying that Seiya was acting weird because he was helping him out to make things work out with him and Kanae. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanime turns out to be Seiya, who was trying to fix the problems caused by the others, after Shiina sent him an email explaining how odd he was acting at school.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">Lemony Narrator</a>: Eiko does this in episode 7 during the pirate show.

Seiya immediately exploits this, and has several of the girls wear bikinis and promote a commercial for the park.<ul><li> The entire plot is based on loophole abuse. When Seiya is told about the goal and deadline, he immediately points out that the only thing measured is the number of people who walk through the main gate and instructs the staff to disregard other important metrics like profitability, time spent in park per guest, money spent per guest, and sustainability as concerns they can worry about after the deadline. Among his schemes to get more park attendance is lowering the prices on attractions and admittance to 30 yen (about $0.25) and later free, hosting a soccer match in a stadium the park owns (aiming to attract about 50,000 soccer fans, even if they don't attend the park's attractions), to just calling people and asking them to stop by. One character even <em>orders a pizza</em>, because the deliveryman counts as one guest if he goes through the main gate. It's all the land developer's fault for having a contract that doesn't stipulate that the guests counted must be <em>paying customers</em> of the park.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniac</a>: Tiramie, the Fairy of Flowers is a huge pervert, always complementing the girls on their bodies.

Made worse for her due to Macaron putting a magic bean in her curry which forces her to speak her mind on various subjects. So naturally the topic of Seiya is brought up a few times causing her to hold her mouth, as well as bang her head on something whenever she lets something slip.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveLetterLunacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveLetterLunacy">Love Letter Lunacy</a>: Kanae Tsuchida, a girl that attends the same school as Seiya, accidentally puts a love letter in his locker in episode 8.

Unfortunately it only works once per person/thing he uses it on... and Isuzu plays him into wasting her use. That said, the few times he does utilize the power, it gives him incredible leverage to use in order to help the park out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as offering to sponsor the soccer game when he reads the owner's minds and how they're struggling financially in episode 11.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Used a couple of times:<ul><li> Seiya deliberately invokes this when he first takes over as manager, playing the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> to gauge the employees dedication to their job.

Tiramie says that was kind of rude how he seemed to have ignored Macaron.</li><li> Moffle gets upset at Seiya's desperate and demanding attitude in episode 10. When he gets angry and calls him out, Seiya reveals he knows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Latifa is cursed</span>, causing Moffle to silently walk away since there's no possible retort.
