The 'Magical Index' is considered the Magic side's most powerful weapon and an idealistic symbol of their strength. A large portion of the plot for OT revolves around how the Index is in the hands of the Science side&mdash;and at the disposal of the Imagine Breaker, who is considered a direct enemy of God by the Magic side&mdash;and how the growing political tension between Science and Magic that this creates will eventually lead to war.

Particularly, a lot of time in Touma's fights is spent with him trying to figure out a weakness in his enemy's magic/ability, and a lot of magicians also analyze their opponent's magic to come up with a counterspell.

Their delusion becomes real and the world changes accordingly. Thus, when you look at the Level 5s, you realize that Accelerator is a twisted mess inside, Kakine is twisted to insanity by jealousy, Shizuri is psychotic, Misaki is incredibly paranoid and manipulative, and Gunha believes he's a superhero.

Of the three mains, one is the type who will always do what he feels is right, another is the type who wants to right what he perceives as wrongs, and another just wants to protect the girl who is closest to him.

That being said, only certain types of Esper abilities resemble what is conventionally thought of as "psychic powers" (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Mental Out</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a>: A subplot in New Testament Vol. 2 involved Kaori trying to take down Radiosconde Castle before it found and crushed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Touma</span>.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>:<ul><li> With his street fighting experience and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>, Touma Kamijou can handily defeat street thugs and people who rely exclusively on their powers.

Also, despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, he gets hospitalized a lot, since it tends to work too slow to matter in a fight.

Since Motoharu has special black ops training and has likely done this several times, he is calm, composed, and uses proper skydiving technique. Since Touma has not had any skydiving training or experience, and Motoharu didn't even ask for his permission before suddenly kicking him out of the plane, he completely panics, tumbles through the air helplessly, and struggles to find the parachute chord. When he finally manages to pull it, his back was to the ground, so the parachute deploys wrong and a cable wraps around his neck and chokes him while the tangled parachute barely slows his fall.

He was a normal high school boy living a normal life until he got his special right hand, World Rejecter. He then proceeded to gather over a hundred girls in a few weeks.

For example: The School Garden is one of the best districts to go to as not only it looks like an European city, it where most of the elite girl schools and high class shops are located. However only elite school girls are allowed in the School Garden and school girls from other districts need permission to enter there. District 10 aka "The Strange" is one of the worst districts as not only is it dirty and many building are run down and in disrepair, it's also where most of the gangs like the Skill-Outs lived. It comes to no surprise why the city's only cemetery and correctional facility is also located there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengefulVendingMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengefulVendingMachine">Vengeful Vending Machine</a>: Touma puts in a 2000 yen bill into a vending machine to get a drink.
