The manga regularly waits to reveal a new skill or other system exploit until Naofumi actively uses it and an explanation is required, if any explanation is provided at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>:<ul><li> While in all mediums she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> who acts as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> for Naofumi, in the web novel, light novel, and manga, Raphtalia is fully up to doing a lot of morally questionable actions, including trying to kill other people if they are her enemies, without a second thought if it means keeping Naofumi and herself safe. The anime completely removes this aspect of her, making her a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> who thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him</a> about her former tormenter, and when she thinks she accidentally killed him, she goes into a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseHandsHaveKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseHandsHaveKilled">These Hands Have Killed</a> about it until Naofumi reassures her that she's still a good person despite what she did.</li><li> Regarding the King and Malty's punishments when they were finally exposed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the light novel and manga, Naofumi immediately demanded that they be executed, but Mirelia talked him down from that punishment. In the anime, Mirelia is the one who orders for their execution by beheading, but Naofumi's conscience gets the better of him, realizing he wouldn't actually be satisfied with just letting them die, and he requests they be spared. Though he plays it off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">Cruel Mercy</a> instead, wanting them to suffer indignity by taking away their royal names of Autocray and Malty, replacing them with "Trash" and "Bitch" respectively (with the former Malty also getting the adventurer aliases of "Bitchie (manga translation)/Slut (Japanese anime)/Whore (English anime dub)") after getting a verbal roasting. It helped earlier he'd had a premonition about yielding to his wrath and letting them be executed, and it scared him, no doubt due to Raphtalia and Firo being around him.</span></li><li> In the manga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with a sinister face, Naofumi also was about to kill a helpless Glass inebriated with the the luchol fruit juice. In the same circumstance in the anime, he tried to convince her to give up and retreat.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">Adaptational Jerkass</a>: In the web novel, Atla sees Raphtalia as her rival for Naofumi's affections, but doesn't do anything more than calmly state that she isn't backing down no matter what. In the light novel, however, she loses quite a bit of her politeness, ribbing and snarking at Raphtalia every chance she gets. As for Fohl, Atla's indifference of him turns into annoyance, with her calling him weak and (effortlessly) knocking him out several times, once simply because he was standing and blocking the way of a monster she wanted to fight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy">Adaptational Nice Guy</a>:<ul><li> Naofumi is far less embittered and angry about everything in the manga, and more prone to acting light-hearted.</li><li> The anime makes Naofumi come across as overall a better person due to not being able to truly adapt his internal thoughts and views on people like the original Light Novel did. Thus while he still is rough around the edges, he is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> at the start.</li><li> The anime largely downplays Mirelia's abilities as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">a chessmaster</a>. In both the original Light Novel and Manga, she was manipulative to Naofumi and managed to convince him to be more lenient with punishing the King and Malty, with Naofumi even noting how clever she was to get him to agree to it. Heck, the outcome of it was her plan too and she was very stern on enforcing it. The anime maintains her political savvy skills, but she is much less stern and manipulative than the Light Novel or Manga. She outwardly shows regret at having to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">punish her family, and she instead opts to simply have them executed, though she admits had Naofumi not stepped in, she would have begged him to spare them</span>.

Even if he had unlocked it sometime later, he would have stayed in one place to build an army rather than wandering around the countryside with a couple of companions. Strangely he never uses this supposed brainwashing ability when accused of having one which would have been the best time to use it. Fortunately, Motoyasu is the only one of the heroes genuinely stupid enough to believe this, and the rest are fanatical cannon fodder that were more likely brainwashed themselves by the Church itself.</li><li> That Naofumi, the Shield Hero, somehow kills both Ren and Itsuki along with their parties with no survivors.

They can copy weapons and absorb materials to learn new skills like the Legendary Heroes, but each also possesses a unique method of strengthening their weapons. An individual Seven Star Hero is weaker than a Legendary Hero, but still much stronger than a normal person. As a whole, they are powerful enough to drive back the waves should the Legendary Heroes fall.</li><li> Whereas the Four Legendary Weapons are distinct from each other, most of the Seven Star Weapons overlap with the Legendary Weapons or each other to some capacity.

Malty is a horrible, horrible woman who has <em>earned</em> the suffering she goes through, but even her most antagonized victim can't bring himself to enjoy it.

There are several times in the series where all four of the heroes fight someone who is a genuine threat because they are a trained fighter, or have tools they can use to even the odds. Even Naofumi, the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">unlikely to be this trope</a>, is only stronger than the average fighter thanks to the Shields raw power.</li><li> Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki compared to Naofumi, both because their Legendary Weapons are actual weapons and their levels are higher than the latter's for a while. Deconstructed in that for all their put-downs toward Naofumi for being stuck with a "useless class", the latter still manages to be the biggest threat of the four due to actually bothering to master each one of his shields and fully exploiting their abilities, heightened stat growths and permanent bonuses towards himself and his party, but he's also the only one fully solving problems (half of them that the former three wound up causing, no less) as a result by taking the situation seriously and utilizing other less flashy but useful skills such as cooking and potion-making.
