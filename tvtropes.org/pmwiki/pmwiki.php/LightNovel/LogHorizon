On the day that a new expansion pack was scheduled to become active, every single player logged into the server suddenly found themselves <em>within</em> the world of Elder Tale. Most of the game functions are still active and "death" simply revives the player at their last home point. But in every other sense, the world is "real" and hundreds of thousands of players are now trapped in what used to be a game.</p><p>With no indication of how or why this incident occurred, the players of Elder Tale must learn how to survive in this strange new world while they look for a way home.</p><p>Though similar in premise to the well-established and well-known <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> franchises, <em>Log Horizon</em> is notable in several ways: it takes great care to explain the internal logic and mechanics of the game world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">player death is treated as a relatively minor inconvenience</a>, and it is very focused on the lifestyle aspects of the various characters as they all adjust to living in this strange space. The drama of dying in the game world doesn't exist, and so the plot can instead center on how they settle into their new lives in the game, which has a whole host of preexisting rules, laws, and societies to make things interesting.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Log Horizon is written by Mamare Touno, who also created the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Maoyu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Maoyu">Maoyu</a></em> light novels. It has been adapted into a 2-season anime series which aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NHK">NHK</a> from October 2013 to March 2015.

A third season was later announced in January 2020 with an October 2020 release, though it was later delayed to January 2021.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the story has its own share of spinoffs:</p><ul><li> "Dragonhowl Mountains" (web novel): Originally a side-story written on Touno's personal site in between volumes 5 and 6, which focused on Kanami, the former leader of the legendary "Debauchery Tea Party." The side-story later became part of the main story, with "Dragonhowl Mountains" as the ninth volume, "Go East, Kanami!"</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <em>Log Horizon Gaiden: Kushiyatama, Do Your Best!</em> (light novel): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanfic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanfic">Originally a fan fic</a> titled <em>Into a Remote Town</em>, the story was later published as an official side-story novel at the same time as volume 10's release. It follows former D.D.D member Kushiyatama and her long-time friend Yaezakura immediately after the Catastrophe.</li><li> <em>Log Horizon</em> (manga): Illustrated by Hara Kazuhiro, the light novel's illustrator, the one-volume manga gives a quick overview of the events in the first light novel volume. (More chapters for the manga were published in <em>Weekly Famitsu</em>, but were never compiled into volumes.)</li><li> <em>Log Horizon: Honey Moon Logs</em> (manga): A retelling of the first two <em>Log Horizon</em> volumes from the Crescent Moon Alliance's perspective.</li><li> <em>Log Horizon: The West Wind Brigade</em> (manga): A retelling and expansion of the first five volumes from the perspective of Soujirou's eponymous guild.</li><li> <em>Log Horizon: Nyanta's Fortune Recipes</em> (manga): A collection of slice-of-life vignettes focusing on, obviously, Nyanta's cooking, and the interactions he has with Akiba's other residents while he does so. The manga spans the events of the first ten light novel volumes.</li></ul><p>The series is notable for prompting a surprise visit by Mamare himself to 4chan for an impromptu Q&amp;A session with English-speaking fans, which was followed up by two more in the wake of episodes 10 and 25.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YenPress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YenPress">Yen Press</a> licensed the original light novels, Hara's manga adaption, and <em>Log Horizon: The West Wind Brigade</em> in 2015.</p><p>The rulebook for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>-style tabletop RPG based on the series was released in March 2014, accompanied by <a class="urllink" href="http://mamare.net/wp-content/uploads/04.jpg">a story of a session played using the rules by four authors<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> &mdash; Ayasato Keiji (<em>Beyond Another Darkness</em>, <em>Marginal Operation</em>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MurasakiYukiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MurasakiYukiya">Murasaki Yukiya</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AltinaTheSwordPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AltinaTheSwordPrincess">Altina the Sword Princess</a></em>), Maruyama Kugane (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord2012">OVERLORD</a></em>), Shibamura Yuuri (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GunparadeMarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GunparadeMarch">Gunparade March</a>: Another Princess</em>). Set during the initial few days after the Catastrophe in the Ritorabure Islands (based on the RL Bonin Islands), four stranded Adventurers attempt to find a way to return to the mainland. On their way back they come across a mysterious Lander girl Nagi, and gets involved the incident surrounding her loss of memory.</p><p>Finally, as a general warning, this page covers tropes seen both in the anime and the light novels, as well as the various spin-offs. As such, fans of the anime (even those who have seen every episode) should be careful about reading through spoilers, as many reference plot points that have yet to come up in the anime. <em><strong>Consider yourself as having been warned.</strong></em> Also, all character tropes should be moved to the appropriate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LogHorizon">character page</a> whenever possible.</p><p>Not related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HorizonInTheMiddleOfNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HorizonInTheMiddleOfNowhere">Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> (commonly abbreviated as LoGH and thus, confused for <em>Log Horizon</em>).</p><hr><h2><em>Log Horizon</em> provides examples of:</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# to D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects">2D Visuals, 3D Effects</a>: It's pretty easy to tell that the Goblins and Sauhagin are 3D models.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: Most obvious in episode 7, where a good chunk of the first half of the episode (the preparation by the Crescent Moon Alliance) had to be taken from their manga spinoff <em>Honey Moon Log</em>. In the equivalent chapter (chapter 3 of book 3), only seven <em>very</em> short paragraphs are devoted to it.<ul><li> Add to this the participation of Soujirou's West Wind Brigade in the Crescent Moon scheme, whereas in the light novel (and also in the anime), Shiroe asks him to send the invitations for the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Round Table Council</span> to the other guild masters.</li><li> In episode 8, we see Isaac and Krusty's reaction to Maryelle's invitation, which isn't seen in the light novel.</li><li> In a minor case, the English Dub adds a line in Episode 6 from Shiroe explaining the name of the titular guild (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">Badass Creed</a> below).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>: Episode 10 of season 2 focuses on William, guildmaster of the Silver Swords.

Krusty and Henrietta do the same, with Henrietta pushing hers up by the side.

The server Shiroe plays in runs the Tokyo section of the world (specifically, Akihabara is the hub zone). The current civilization exists in the wake of two apocalypses. The first wiped out the "ancient empire", with a fairly prosperous civilization appearing afterward. The second apocalypse was the first World Fraction when the Alv created the beast races as revenge for their destruction, reducing the global population to roughly a quarter of what it had been.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided">A House Divided</a>: In episode 17 of season 2, members of the Round Table discuss the growing discontent between craftsmen and large guilds having more wealth than smaller guilds and those without crafting professions. They discuss various solutions, such as confiscating blueprints and excess money, but others are against it, stating it would kill innovation. Shiroe is unable to offer any solutions up front, but he does note they'll have to address this issue, and asks the other members to come up with solutions they could work on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a>: Naotsugu believes this with passion.

First, to obtain the funds he needed, he sought help from the Crescent Moon Alliance, whom he trusted, to open an eatery utilising Nyanta's revolutionary cooking discovery. The eatery was an instant success and not only procured some funds but also attracted the attention of the large guilds. He then persuaded Marielle and Henrietta to negotiate with the large manufacturing guilds for an investment in the eatery in exchange for its secrets. This secured the funds Shiroe needed. Next, he seized the opportunity to call for a meeting among the largest and most influential guilds and proposed the formation of a self-governing council to maintain peace and order in Akihabara and appealed to the guilds through the benefits of doing so. When that failed, he revealed that he had purchased the Guild Hall building, effectively granting him the ability to deny other players the right to access this vital structure. This forced the invited guilds to reach a compromise and the Round Table Council was established. It is later revealed that in case his previous gambit failed, Shiroe has yet <em>another trump card</em> in his sleeve. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">The Strategist</a> indeed.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Portal Network</a>: It's offline, forcing players to walk through the game-world from one place to another.<ul><li> This in turn necessitates the Serara <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc">Rescue Arc</a>, since she can't simply warp from Susukino to Akihabara.

The former asks him about the collateral damage to the buildings and the deaths it would cause to the Landers. The leader explains that they want to get out of the game, and every time they die they can glimpse parts of the real world.
