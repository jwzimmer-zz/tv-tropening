Even if that means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">taking it over</a>.</p><p>The TV airing of the anime was accompanied by a series of comedic web shorts.

They effectively abandoned the people of the capital and concentrated their efforts in reinforcing their own holdings. This endears them to the peasantry not at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentAdorationRating">100% Adoration Rating</a>: Momonga's NPC allies practically worship him... largely because they were initially programmed to be loyal, but they genuinely see him as a great leader, and don't just praise him because they're forced to. He finds their faith challenging to live up to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects">2D Visuals, 3D Effects</a>:<ul><li> The skeletal dragons in episode 9 are clearly CG, still, they move and flow organically, and the battle is truly seamless.</li><li> Most other monsters are also CG, like the skeleton horde or orcs/ogres/trolls/goblins, though it's much less noticeable usually. It makes sense though since this is an anime about a Video Game and giving enemies a "different" look makes it easier to distance from them emotionally and thus easier to kill them. Interestingly, the friendly goblins that guard Carne Village are an aversion of this trope, being drawn in the same style as other characters.</li><li> Armies are also CGI, which leads to a rather <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmy</a> moment when several kingdom soldiers rush Enri's goblins and bounce back as though the goblins' shields were made of rubber. Similarly, the 70,000 soldiers Momonga wipes out with his "Ia Shub Niggurath" spell simply fall down like rag dolls.</li><li> Momonga's "Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown" looks drawn and fits the scene really well, but when released it has a tendency to float and rotate perfectly in a way that's a dead giveaway to being CG, possibly intentionally so as to give it a magical air.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">A-Cup Angst</a>: Shalltear has small breasts, so she stuffs her bra. It's one of the many things that makes her so opposed to Albedo, who has quite large breasts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence">Above the Influence</a>: Played with in the anime. On the one hand (literally) among Momonga's first "experiments", he gropes Albedo's chest (after requesting and getting her permission, and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmodestOrgasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmodestOrgasm">greatly enjoyed it</a>). On the other hand, when she <em>excitedly asked him to take her virginity,</em> he turned her down as there were more pressing matters to contend with at the moment. Ultimately subverted in the light novel because although he is still attracted to both Shalltear and Albedo, often times very strongly, he actually <em>can't</em> have sex with them due to lacking the proper equipment thanks to his skeletal body. This secretly frustrates him to no end, despite how he appears in public, especially around Albedo and/or Shalltear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade">Absurdly Sharp Blade</a>:<ul><li> Several of the "heroic" weapons in Ainz's arsenal work like this. He can slice ogres in half vertically or horizontally with one strike like a hot knife through butter.</li><li> He also has a spell called "Reality Slash" which creates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Sword Beam</a> sharp enough to cut through <strong>the fabric of reality itself</strong>. Touch Me is said to have used an even stronger version of this attack called "World Break".</li><li> A special mention goes to Gazef's sword, one of the treasures of the kingdom, the sword <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">"Razor Edge"</a>. It is already a fabled weapon in-universe, being able to cut through steel like it was paper, but what makes it really special is the fact that, while it is just a low-level enchanted item by YGGDRASIL standards, it is the only native weapon that Ainz confirmed could actually hurt or even kill him!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Quite a few badass females have appeared in the series, such as Albedo, Shalltear, Aura, the Pleiades, and especially Blue Rose, an adventurer group full of only women and one of the few Adamantite ranked adventurers in the Kingdom.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: Many fans were disappointed (and some downright <em>pissed</em>) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadHouse">Mad House</a> decided to cut out a lot of scenes in the light novel to rush the first season of the anime to finish up to the third volume.<ul><li> For example, the amount of detail regarding Brain's fight with Shalltear was removed and turned Brain from a hardened warrior that was slowly broken from facing off against Shalltear's overwhelming strength into an arrogant fool that ran away like a baby after meeting someone who was stronger than he expected.

The Katze Plains was relatively easier as Ainz is a powerful undead Overlord and has many spells and magic which allow him to control all manner of undead from mindless zombies to intelligent undead (he apparently has the ghost ship that was haunting the plains and the spectral sailors aboard flying his banner while acting as border patrol).</li><li> Averted within the Tomb Of Nazarick.

Likewise, his second-in-command, Albedo is noted to be less combat-able than Shalltear, and that Demiurge is superior to her in terms of intelligence.

He also tended to be pushy and controlling when it came to what he believed in, which alienated some people.</li><li> Remedios seems to be designed to tear down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> by setting up situations where her morals get in the way of actually getting anything done.

Even Ainz respects him. That being said, he tended to be a supporting character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and was killed off because of his unwavering beliefs, though the story does portray this having been the right thing to do, especially based on what he knew.</span></li><li> Climb is a subversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove">Courtly Love</a>.

Even taking them or Nazarick aside, almost every native from the new world, who is not a regular citizen, adventurer or heroic figure, is either psychotic, racist, smug, depraved or dangerous, with some being even worse than the citizens of Nazarick (which is no easy, really).

Momonga is rather disappointed. Oddly enough, everyone else in the New world is deeply impressed by the King and see it as a wise and powerful beast. Momonga wonders if there's something wrong with his sense of aesthetics. Though the King is a weakling compared to the rest of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, his average "level" is around 30, making him stronger than most in the setting (although Ainz discovers tales of its prowess were likely vastly exaggerated by whatever adventurer first ran into it).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a>:<ul><li> You got the Great Tomb of Nazarick, Blue Rose, and the Black Scripture.</li><li> The first summoned goblin team's official art shows them this way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">Badass Family</a>: The residents of Nazarick may be cruel and unmerciful monsters that won't hesitate to kill humans if ordered too, they're quite close to one another and act like one big happy family.

Demiurge and Shalltear are notorious for being vicious if a lieutenant fails at an easy task, while Albedo is quite vocal about issuing severe punishment for the smallest slights against Momonga or Nazarick as a whole. They even hold this behavior on themselves as well, since they consider failing Momonga as an unforgivable sin that must be paid with a gruesome punishment, and always expect (and basically insist) Momonga to punish them whenever they feel they've failed/disrespected him, which Momonga always refuses.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>: Sebas Tian fills this role as leader to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Ninja Maid</a> Pleiades.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouSay">Be Careful What You Say</a>: As a godlike figure whose every word is considered unbreakable law by his followers, Momonga realizes this a bit too late before discovering the ramifications of several offhand comments he makes within earshot of the Floor Guardians.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: Jircniv is fully convinced that the only way to stop Ainz is to get him to show his true power before witnesses, so as to convince the other nations to unite against Nazarick. So he asks Ainz to use his most powerful spell to signal the beginning of the attack. His aides consider it impossible that Ainz could kill as many as a thousand men with a single spell, but Ainz casts one that instakills <em>70,000 people</em> before summoning monsters that raise the death toll to 180,000 (out of 250,000). As a result, everyone thinks Jircniv was overall responsible for the massacre, undermining the goodwill other nations have towards him, and leading some countries to believe uniting against Nazarick is suicide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">Beauty Is Bad</a>: The Pleiades and Albedo, at the very least, are considered so beautiful that they can't be human.

She doesn't bother to report things like giant monsters leading armies near the village, because who cares if a bunch of humans (including, unbeknownst to her, those Ainz had plans for) get wiped out? Ainz has to make it clear she is to defend the important people in the village for her to do so (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and even then she'd gladly watch them die screaming</span>, something the village goblins are quick to pick up on).</li><li> Ainz' every attempt at being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Benevolent Boss</a> (paying the underlings, giving them days off...) ends in failure because they consider it an honor if not a religious duty to serve him.

If he abandons them or dies, the Great Tomb of Nazarick would then have an heir they could obey in his absence. However, Momonga being a full skeletal lich, should make that rather difficult to execute. They still think that there is a way to make this work.

Additionally, it is a fifth level spell, and humans rarely ever manage to reach even the third level of magic, so mostly, the creatures able to cast it are the powerful monster races which are also the least likely to want to help someone in the first place.

The main character, Momonga/Ainz, is overpowered and has a legion of loyal followers including a harem of sorts, but he also gradually becomes the monster he appears as in his quest to create a kingdom for those who serve him. Furthermore, Ainz being overpowered causes a complete breakdown of the status-quo in the world, as his appearance changes how powerful things like magic can truly be, and makes everyone realize they have no chance of stopping someone whose weaker spells are comparable to the strongest spells their most trained magic uses can use. Even the harem aspect is given this, as the Floor Guardians worship him as a God, and believe they owe their beings to him, instead of being attracted out of genuine affection, and none of those romantically interested in Ainz are good people. Bluntly speaking, the series shows that an overpowered main character showing up in a fantasy world would be a horrible idea as time goes on, especially for the original inhabitants of the fantasy world. And it's not so much better for the main character himself, since he gradually loses his humanity and morals because of the lack of any challenge or equals in his life, and he can't be himself or connect with anyone because everybody considers him as either a god, a leader, an unstoppable force of evil, a monster or a (not healthy) lust object.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiverOfLameNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiverOfLameNames">Giver of Lame Names</a>: Momonga/Ainz has horrible naming sense.

Arche doubles over vomiting and is pretty much incapacitated just from the sheer magical pressure emanating from him, and Roberdyck is forced to cast a courage spell on her just to get her back on her feet.

This backfired spectacularly: the spell was so powerful and horrifying that it drove the Empire's knights to run away in sheer terror (the only casualties on their side were the ones who were trampled by their fleeing comrades), with many of the survivors quitting military service (and the Empire can't replace knights as quickly as the Kingdom can replace their soldiers) and blaming Jircniv for making the request in the first place. And though they don't know it, that wasn't actually Ainz's strongest spell (though it was one of the flashier ones) so the Empire still doesn't know Ainz's true power.</li><li> The Slane Theocracy considers the Kingdom to be this. The Slane Theocracy founded the Kingdom long ago in the hopes that it would be a breeding ground for future heroes of humanity. Instead, the Kingdom became a cesspool of infighting and corruption.

It heavily tones down the darker aspects of the characters' personalities, and even outright omits a lot of the really dark background details, such as Demiurge's "sheep farm". It's to the point that, when the 3rd season showed the point in the story where Ainz and the Tomb directly tortured and slaughtered a bunch of mostly good and decent people on-screen, unlike the absolute scum of past seasons, a lot of anime-only viewers were aghast at how genuinely villainous Ainz could be.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">A Lighter Shade of Black</a>: Almost to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey">grey</a>, if you were to consider just Momonga.

He believes he was in the mid-upper tier. In the new fantasy world, the average "levels" are much, much lower. It's hinted that there are beings that rival or surpass him in power (possibly other former players), but as of volume 8 he hasn't met any yet.</li><li> It's more than just hinted... it's pretty much canon that other YGGDRASIL players <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">arrived <em>BEFORE</em> Momonga to the New World. That is to say they arrived centuries in the timeline before he did. This explains why things from YGGDRASIL &mdash; like World Class Items, summon monsters, and magic spells &mdash; exist in the New World. They were introduced by past YGGDRASIL players. A major current question is, "what happened to them?" Another question is, "will more arrive in the future?" As stated above, Momonga has yet to encounter another YGGDRASIL player, ally or enemy, but would rather try to negotiate a peaceful coexistence if he does meet one.</span></li><li> Momonga and his guild NPCs are the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fourth known group to arrive from YGGDRASIL. The first set was known to the New World as the Six Gods. While their ultimate fate is unknown, one was killed at least once by the next group to arrive, and none of them have appeared again in centuries. The second set became known as the Eight Greed Kings. After conquering the world through violence and bloodshed, the eight turned against each other, ultimately killing or weakening themselves to a point natives of the New World could slay them. The third set was two players who became part of the Thirteen Heroes. Like the Greed Kings before them, the pair ultimately had a falling out and slew each other.</span> Given the final fate of these individuals, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda">Dragon with an Agenda</a> cited above makes a whole lot of sense.

This is the limits most races can reach through training alone with differences in power being due to racial benefits (a level 20 lizard man is stronger than a level 20 human because lizard men have naturally stronger bodies than humans).</li><li> Class 2: This is the level at which a human fighter of any kind is considered superhuman. At this stage humans have a variety of martial arts skills to enhance themselves and are comparable to a small army of standard soldiers. This also includes spell casters that reach Tier 2 in magic which is at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">about level 14</a>. By YGGDRASIL standards this would be level 21-30 for any non-magical individual and of course for magic users capable of 2nd and 3rd tier magic. Most need to be gifted to reach this level and only especially strong monster races are at this stage by default.</li><li> Class 3: This stage is exceptionally rare for any member of weaker races like humans or elves. Only very powerful beasts like dragons are at this level by default. In order for humans or any weaker races to achieve this, they must either have a rare gift, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge">posses exceptional longevity</a>, must be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemiGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemiGod">god-kin</a>, or come from Yggdrasil itself. More powerful races can reach this stage through training. By YGGDRASIL standards it would be about level 31-60. Magic users that fall into this category are capable of 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th tier magic.</li><li> Class 4: The number of beings in the New World that fall into this category are less than 1% of the total population. The only new world natives that fall into this class are ancient legendary creatures like the dragon lords. It's virtually impossible for most new world inhabitants to reach this level and aside from legendary monsters only the god-kin and people from Yggdrasil have this kind of power. By YGGDRASIL standards this would be level 61-80. Any magic caster falling into this class can use 8th, 9th, and 10th tier magic.</li><li> Class 5: lower level class 5 is the limit of power for the strongest in Overlord. While unable to effect the entire world at once, any character in the class can destroy the world (gradually) on their own. this would level 81 - 100 by YGGDRASIL standards.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat">Sure, Let's Go with That</a>: A lot of the humor in this series comes from the way people around Ainz interpret everything he says or does to be evidence of his status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>.

Demiurge then suggests that they basically make the Lizardmen swear fealty to Nazarick as a test case for them ruling over many lands and races later.

Fortunately for him, his stats came with, and despite lacking muscular tissue, he's easily killed several giant trolls, ogres, and countless other monsters using only swords and maces, and crushed at least one human to death with his bare hands. His magical prowess is even more frightening, as he is completely unrivaled (except by maybe the New World gods) and has access to hundreds of spells and skills that allow him to summon gigantic Eldritch Abominations of his own, summon massive hordes of powerful undead, kill every living and undead thing (except himself of course) within a radius of several miles, and even stop time altogether. Among many other things.

Marquis Raeven is just about the only one to take the warning seriously, and makes his plans by assuming Ainz is able to inflict 10,000 casualties during the battle, out of 250,000. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Try 70,000 with a single spell, and a killcount at <em>180,000</em> by the end of the battle</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderlingWithAnFInPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderlingWithAnFInPR">Underling with an F in PR</a>:<ul><li> Ainz' underlings in general have great difficulty in being even remotely friendly towards humans (as all of them are heteromorphic species, "no humans allowed" being one of the basic rules of the guild), which goes against Ainz' dream of peace and cooperation between the many races of the new world. And while he no longer has the means to directly change their personalities, he's also loath to order them to act nice, because they aren't responsible for the personalities their creators gave them (and as some of their creators were going through an edgelord phase, quite a few of those personalities have serious issues).</li><li> He even tries to get them to play an RPG as humans to better understand how they think... and all it does is confirm their view that humans are worthless creatures barely fit to serve Nazarick.</li><li> Narberal Gamma, chosen by Ainz to accompany him in his adventurer guise as she's the most human-looking of the Pleiades combat maid squad, turns out to be incapable of referring to humans as anything other than some kind of insect or arachnid, finding a different species to use every time.

It's implied that a lot of the good works she does are simply an act to make herself look better in his eyes.</li><li> Albedo and Shalltear are this for Momonga. The pair would happily fight to the death to win his affection if he desired it, and other Floor Guardians are careful to avoid saying things that could make them turn violent about it. However the fact that Momonga <em>doesn't</em> want them fighting over him (or even be the object of their lust), and it would take massive amounts of damage for one to kill the other, their rivalry is mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. There's also an interesting twist to the dynamic: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's explicitly stated that Shalltear and Albedo <em>might</em> be willing to share Momonga, and their aggression is determining who gets to be his wife and who gets to be his mistress... however, neither wants to be second place</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>: Part of Ainz' problem is that each and every one of the servants who were brought over with him view him as their creator and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> and cannot even conceive of disobeying or backtalking him, which creates problems when he's genuinely trying to make their lives easier and they only want to serve him. He starts recruiting natives in order to have a different perspective on things. One scene in the light novel illustrates his first attempt at getting around this: he creates a Death Knight and uses it to take a poll. Unfortunately, a Death Knight is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mook</a>|s (and is extremely aware of this fact), but the denizens of Nazarick <em>still</em> treat him as the Will Of Ainz Made Manifest, which prevents the poor Death Knight from carrying out his mission properly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotWantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotWantToKnow">You Do Not Want To Know</a>: Orcs captured by Jaldabaoth are so broken by the memories of their torture they refuse to tell Ainz what it was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It very likely involved having to kill and eat each others' children and long with being flayed alive and healed.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>: Sebas looks like an old man, having white hair and a beard, but he was created by one of Ainz Ooal Gown&#146;s guild members within a game that is inferred to be from the previous generation which couldn&#146;t be more than at most 20 years ago.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMoneyIsNoGoodHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMoneyIsNoGoodHere">Your Money Is No Good Here</a>: YGGDRASIL currency isn't recognized in the New World, though it's still incredibly valuable since it's mostly pure gold. Ainz as "Momon" avoids using it since he doesn't want "Momon" to be associated with Nazarick yet. One of the reasons for the adventurer guise is to earn some New World currency.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">Your Soul Is Mine</a>: In the Web Novel, this is how the World Class Item "Avarice and Generous" works in the New World.
