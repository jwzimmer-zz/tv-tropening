She also figures out how to use the last three pieces Sora left for her to defeat Chlammy</span>.</li><li> Done again during the game in Episode 11, when Sora explains to Izuna (and the audience) at how Shiro is such an expert at first-person shooters that Izuna's shots seem to fly through her, while her own shots seem to home in on the latter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>: Sora does this to the Warbeasts in Episode 8, basically calling their bluff on how they use "mind reading" to win against their opponents. He then bets Imanity's Exceed piece in whatever game they plan on playing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He even tells them about how he figured a lot of those things out based simply on cold reading and what Stephanie's grandfather, the previous King of Elchea, wrote about his games against them.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">Badass Creed</a>: Sora and Shiro work under one principle, fueled by their complete faith in each other and the plays they make:<div class="indent">"&#12302;&#12288;&#12288;&#12303; never loses!"</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem">Balanced Harem</a>: Sora is surrounded by several pretty girls who become interested in him one way or another and get their share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>, but there are no serious romantic plots with any of them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">Barbie Doll Anatomy</a>: Invoked during "Materialization Shiritori" in Episode 6, a game in which anything the players can name is either called into (if not yet present) or removed from existence (if already present). Sora mentions the word "girls' clothing", thereby completely stripping Shiro, Stephanie and Jibril naked. However, one of his earlier words was "naughty bits", making the scenario a little bit more "family-friendly".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>:<ul><li> Sora pulled two during Jibril's game. When he was first testing the limits of the game, he summoned a Hydrogen Bomb, figuring that Jibril would protect them since ending the game in one turn would be rather boring. Then, on the last turn, he correctly assumed that Jibril would use his earlier insult to finish him off, both out of her pride from being insulted and to insult his pride by having him lose to the word he taught her. This allows him to chain Coloumb's Force to it and win the game.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By betting away Imanity's Exceed piece to the Warbeasts in his bid to reclaim lost lands, Sora causes an uproar. Which he doesn't mind, knowing Chlammy (and, by extension, Feel) will exploit the chaos to resurface and challenge him again. True to his words, they do. He also did this to force Imanity to watch the game intently, making it harder for the Warbeasts to blatantly cheat. He then engages Chlammy and Feel in a game of reversi (Othello) with their existences at stake, where Sora deliberately played poorly so Chlammy would receive his memories (just enough to convince her that he is trustworthy), counting on nothing but Shiro intuiting his intentions to continue the game for him after he is erased from existence, winning the game and bringing him back to life. He then proceeds to strike a deal with Feel, convincing her to help him deal with the Warbeasts, as well as change her kin's policy of slavery, and the power to alter Feel's memory. Since Sora obtained the power to alter Feel's memories, when she went to report to Elven Garde about how to beat the Warbeasts' game, she gave them faulty intel that would result in a loss.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleHarem">Battle Harem</a>: Played with. The inhabitants of Disboard don't physically fight and instead use games as a substitute. However, all of Sora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem">Balanced Harem</a> of girls are top gamers who are all capable of holding their own in a game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame">Beat Them at Their Own Game</a>: Used 'against' Imanity in this instance. Imanity used to be much, much more powerful during the days of the war before the rules, as the other races relied on their natural-born strength and magic to overpower their enemies, while Imanity who had neither used strategy and intellect to outmaneuver them and come out on top over them. When Tet came to power, his rules forced the other races to adopt Imanity's tricks for their own. Now without any advantage over the other races, Imanity was knocked down to the bottom rank.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingHumanSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingHumanSucks">Being Human Sucks</a>:<ul><li> Of the sixteen races, only Imanity and Warbeasts have no magic powers, and even then, the latter have heightened strength and senses to get by, truly leaving the former at their mercy.</li><li> Sora's speech in Episode 4 plays with this trope. It can be summarized as "Being human is awesome <em>because</em> we suck but have infinite potential!"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">Beyond the Impossible</a>: A more mundane example &mdash; in the beginning, Sora and Shiro were each controlling two characters at the same time by using their feet to operate the second controller. Sora later demonstrates the ability to control all four.

A lot of the rioters even go so far as to accuse Sora and Shiro of either working with the Warbeasts, or that their previous victories were just a fluke. So considering how serious of a bet this is, it's understandable why they would be upset, despite Sora and Shiro's insistence that they wouldn't lose. Sora reveals he started the rumors of collusion himself, in order to rile the populace so that they would scrutinize the game much more closely for possible cheats, which would force the Warbeasts to play (relatively) fair and square.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!"

Regarding the number of chess STATES: Each of the 64 spaces can be in one of 13 possible states: six types of pieces in two colors, or empty. It could also be either player's turn. This gives a hard limit of 2*13^64 possible states, which is about 3.92E71, or 48.5 orders of magnitude fewer then 1E120. Realistically the number of states is far less than even this, since it doesn't account for the maximum of 16 pieces present, nor impossible states such as adjacent kings or both kings in check. Stronger estimates put the number as below 1E46.7.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: Lots of different hair colors here.<ul><li> Stephanie has red hair, Tet has pink.
