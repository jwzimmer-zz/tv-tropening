Unfortunately, they don't completely appreciate the title, as this leads their commanders to field them on more and more missions where they end up living up to their titles. Thus, the cycle continues.<ul><li> Periodically they <em>do</em> want the respect they feel deserved, usually in the form of a bit more leeway, better assignments, and less grunt work. Instead they're treated like problem soldiers at the bottom of the military hierarchy, which they are, and end up on punishment details and occasionally get lives theatened by Frolaytia. Most notable after the Break Carrier's defeat, with Milinda getting the credit despite their own efforts and being threated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">with 10 lashes</a> due to Qwenthur having groped Frolaytia's breasts earlier.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>: Royal Duels decide which claimant to a throne succeeds and that's the survivor.

This "justified" their subsequent invasion and slaughter of the local population.</li><li> The 101st Zombie Platoon consists of legally dead Legitimacy soldiers armed with Information Alliance weaponry. This sows confusion among their opponents on who is actually attacking and what tactics to expect.</li><li> The headmaster of the Royal Techno Academy shot the student president when she nearly uncovered his theft of funds <em>and</em> his treason.

The rivalry stretches back at least five hundred years, its origins being shrouded in myth. The relationship was largely low-key but has erupted in armed conflicts recently <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to a royal egging them on to cover up his own gaffes</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a>: Frolaytia is a Major, but even before they became famous she was on a first-name basis with Qwenthur and Havia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveSecondForeshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveSecondForeshadowing">Five-Second Foreshadowing</a>: The characters will often realize a bad possibility moments before it becomes a reality.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a>:<ul><li> This is a running theme for the superweapons of the Northern Restricted Zone, where they are incredibly powerful but surprisingly easy to defeat. Of note is the Wotan, a specially designed answer to Objects which has the weakness of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">completely falling apart if exposed to heat</span>. This flaw was intentionally added as part of the gambit by the forces overseeing the Northern Restricted Zone to ensure nobody would take their programs seriously.</li><li> The Tri-Core is considered this for the Third Generation. While it went beyond the limits of the Second Generation, its weaknesses kept it from truly excelling. Despite this, all of the nations are eager to study the underlying concepts to create a true Third Gen Object.</li><li> The Broad Sky Saber may be the first true Third Gen Object as it successfully integrated a space elevator and orbiting satellite into its functions. However its Elite, Prince Dimiksy, added poorly thought-out safety features to the design which could easily be exploited to destroy the Object.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlockOfWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlockOfWolves">Flock of Wolves</a>: The population of Lost Angels consists almost entirely of soldiers disguised as gang members.

Even then they're prone to bickering over food, women, and finding a way to slack off for a bit. Despite this they always find a way to survive and triumph, even if the narrator himself calls them idiots.</li><li> Skuld is a dark version of this trope. She seems to have some hidden plan that allows her to move from one disaster to the next but is simply just that good at taking whatever opportunity presents itself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a>:<ul><li> Staivia was forced to enter an Object she could not control on the threat of soldiers torturing her maid, the last person loyal to Staivia.</li><li> The captured members of the 37th could only watch as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wraith apparently executed Qwenthur</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine">Foreign Queasine</a>: A group of problem soldiers, obviously including Qwenthur and Havia, are assigned to learn survival cooking basics.

The fact that civilians and most soldiers both aren't terribly affected by it is a major driving cause.</li><li> The Northern European Restricted Zone is a more straight example. As Objects are banned the nations instead use conventional military forces. Such forces are largely considered expendable so the region sees war year-round.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect">Future Imperfect</a>: Volume 10 reveals that the upheaval following the UN's collapse resulted in the destruction of large amounts of historical documents across multiple media. As such, there are gaps in history, especially around that time period, and even the belief that the UN's collapse led to the development of Objects is questionable.<ul><li> Azureyfear notes that this could easily have been exacerbated by people who wanted to eliminate any inconvenient parts of their history.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">Gag Boobs</a>: Frolaytia's "titan tits" seem to bounce all over creation in the anime, even when she's barely moving.

Legitimacy Kingdom mainly uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">English words</a> that describe their characteristics, like Indigo Plasma for an Object that has several plasma weapons. Since the main protagonists belong to this faction most Objects only receive this type of codename. The Capitalist Enterprise goes for feminine names like Charbetty and Lily Maria (which has been compared to the tradition of giving hurricanes female names), except the Japanese Objects which are in Japanese like Yuuhi or Ame-no-Uzume.

The problem is their onion armor is tough enough that it's assumed normal Objects' main cannons need to be within 10 km to reliably pierce it. The speed and thus the power of railguns and coilguns drops as the distance increases, laser beams decay as they travel through the air, and the heat of low-stability plasma and rapid-fire beams dissipates. Indirect fire is still part of the playbook, just not usually against other Objects.<ul><li> Low-stability plasma cannons do seem to have an inferior range to other types of main cannons in exchange for greater power, as Baby Magnum's are noted to have an effective anti-Object range of 3 to 4 km with a maximum range of around 10 km, but are described as one of her strongest weapons.</li><li> One entire story arc deals with Break Carrier, a railgun artillery Object whose signature ability is to accurately strike targets with indirect fire from extreme range without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetSpotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetSpotter">Target Spotter</a>.

After him came antagonists who started civil wars, nearly caused an economic collapse, and five separate antagonists who nearly triggered all-out global war. Notably each instance of that war has become more premeditated, less well-meaning, and come closer to actually occurring. The first such instance was only known to a handful of individuals while in Volume 10 first strike targets were being selected.
