A real human being is flat out <em>incapable</em> of the kinds of stunts he pulls (like crossing an ocean to evaluate a professional athele's joints in comparison to a studnt's) because humans can't move at super speed, don't have perfect memory or genius level intellect, can't memorize dozens of textbooks and can't hold multiple conversations at once. Nor can they be everywhere at once to stop bullying or attacks. It may be perfectly true that the Japanese educational system is deeply flawed in many respects, but expecting a human being in charge of dozens or hundreds of students to be able to keep up with Koro-sensei is impossible.<ul><li> This is acknowledged in later chapters when Nagisa considers becoming a teacher himself (which prevents this aesop from breaking). At first he has doubts about being as good as Korosensei because he obviously doesn't have Korosensei's powers, but in the end he resolves to become the best teacher he can be regardless. So a real-life teacher doesn't have to be as super-powered like Koro-Sensei.

He muses that he's faster, stronger, smarter and more skilled than Nagisa in essentially all categories, but he's too much of a showboat to make a proper assassin. Nagisa, the technician, is quiet, looks harmless and is sometimes mistaken for a weak girl, but he's also capable of killing casually, is very level-headed and looks completely innocent and meek until he's already struck.

The event triggers a series of wham episodes that contain major plot revelations that had been a mystery up until that point. You'll never look at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kayano</span> the same way again. Amazingly, the twist actually seems to come out of nowhere...until you go back and realize that the author was laying out some <em>very subtle</em> clues.</li><li> The following chapter follows suit with the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kayano's name isn't even Kaede Kayano.

Also, the "Reaper" defeated by Karasuma used to be an apprentice of Koro-sensei, who is implied to be the assassin who murdered his father.</span></li><li> Chapter 138 is another big Wham: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Koro-sensei did not actually destroy the Moon. It was caused by one of Shiro's experiments, where he injected a mouse with antimatter organs to see what would happen if it died of natural causes. Turns out, not only does the procedure significantly shorten the subject's lifespan, but when an antimatter enhanced being naturally dies, it creates a massively destructive antimatter chain reaction. Koro-sensei's lifespan will end on March 13, suggesting that he wants Class E to kill him to prevent the inevitable disaster.</span></li><li> Chapter 164: The beginning of the end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The government has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> that can kill Koro-sensei and they've trapped him on the mountain until they can fully charge it.

Public outrage over revelations of Kunugigaoka's discriminatory policies forced Asano Sr. to step down, though he not only seems to have anticipated it, but also sees it as an opportunity to start anew.
