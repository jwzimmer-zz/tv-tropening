However, Kayo seems touched by it, and shares a poem she wrote, which consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> words. As Momoka reads it, she laughs and makes fun of it, causing Kayo to "shoot her to death." Momoka also gets killed a moment later by Platy when she suggests selling it after hearing how valuable and rare it is. And in the last arc of episode 10, she abandons Kayo to the invisible attacker stalking them by kicking the log they were using to cross a ravine with, stranding Kayo behind to deal with the attacker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She somehow survived this encounter, then kills Momoka at the end for it.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>:<ul><li> Maya reveals in episode 2 that she has a dislike for natto (fermented soybeans), due to how sticky and smelly it is.

However, she does immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">regret it</a> when she gets home.</li><li> Platy and the crab in episode 11. They have a brief fight when it turns out to still be alive, and later Platy goes through a lot of trouble, including shooting at the girls, to save its life when the girls intended to cook it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then the crab joins them in the hotsprings, and it ends up cooking the crab due to the heated water.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: If you think being younger than Momoka will protect you from her wrath, you'd be <em>very</em> wrong.
