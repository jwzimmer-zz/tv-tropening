This one could possibly be justified in-universe since Odagiri wasn't really interested in the investigation as much as she saw it as an opportunity to be alone with Yamada and make him notice her - without success.</li><li> Sarushima's quest to lose her power so she can kiss a potential boyfriend without seeing the future. She does lose her power at the end of the first witch war, but that's only because all witches in her group lose their powers, and she isn't shown reacting different to it than the other witches, even though she should be one of the happiest. Since her role is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">reduced to cameos</a> after chapter 90, we don't to get find out if she gets a boyfriend either.

Once they ban kissing at the school, Odagiri thinks that Yamada can get away with it by kissing Shiraishi outside of the school grounds. But this is not possible - Asuka follows Yamada and Shiraishi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss">prevents them from kissing</a>. The council also establishes a rule that normal students can't visit suspended students <em>in their private homes</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil">Absurdly Powerful Student Council</a>: The student council president is actually aware of the witches in the school and keeps them in line, and two of the witches actually are in the council. Moreover, according to Tamaki and Miyamura, the power the council holds is absolute. If you're nominated for a place inside this council, you can't refuse. And Rika the seventh witch serves as their enforcer, erasing memories as needed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfAdventure">Academy of Adventure</a>: Suzaku High. A given since it's apparently the only place in the world where magic exists (unless other places are just as good at keeping up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHandHold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHandHold">Accidental Hand Hold</a>: At one point, Yamada grabs Shiraishi by the hand to drag her out of the clubroom so that he can swap bodies with her in private. As he, after some time, walks complaining down the halls, he discovers that he forgot to let go of her hand...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss">Accidental Kiss</a>: Yamada and Shiraishi give each other one as they stumble down the stairs. Actually important in the first few chapters for puzzling out the mechanics of swapping bodies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalProposal">Accidental Proposal</a>: When Miyamura insists that Yamada should propose to Shiraishi in the epilogue, he makes Yamada do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicRoleplay">roleplay</a> where he (Miyamura) plays Shiraishi. Once Yamada goes along with it and yells "will you marry me?!", Shiraishi walks in and thinks Yamada is proposing to Miyamura.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The live-action show goes in its own direction for the plot after the introductory episodes, and it overtook the manga by ending first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication">Adaptation Explanation Extrication</a>: The anime has several due to how fast-paced it is. For example, the scene where Yamada swaps bodies with Shiraishi to go on a date with Tsubaki and prevent him from setting the old school building on fire is left in, but it&#146;s never explained why Shiraishi couldn&#146;t just go on the date herself &#150; because the anime omits the scene where the club finds out that the only potential way to change the future is through a body-swap.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: The series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a> comes when Yamada's friends lose all their memories of him and start treating him like a stranger. It's not the unrealistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> that's supposed to be the scary thing here - no, the scary thing is the (unfortunately) more realistic scenario of a person who has good friends and - as Yamada himself expresses it - "lives the high life", but suddenly becomes all alone and feels how painful loneliness is. A bit of mundane horror comes in from realizing that Yamada actually lived this way for almost a year before the start of the series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Or at least he thought so</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllElectionsAreSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllElectionsAreSeriousBusiness">All Elections Are Serious Business</a>: The election campaign and preliminary festivities for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> election in the second witch war are rather over-the-top, especially because it's the first ever actual election in 40 years (40 years ago, a bill was enacted making it possible for the president to appoint his successor on his own, but the bill was revoked through a motion of no-confidence - which in itself is an example of stupidly complicated politics for a mere high school student council). Justified in Yamada and co.'s case since the result of election may change their lives completely, but all other students also go crazy even though - for all they know - the worst thing the election may mean to most of them is a cut in their club budget.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>: Yamada's plan to work extremely hard to get into Tono, Japan's most prestiged university, to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get the attention of Shiraishi, who had forgotten everything about him</span>, turns out to have been for naught when the thing that <em>actually</em> makes him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">catch Shiraishi's attention and making her fall in love with him all over again is simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">being himself</a> and calling her out on being boring</span>... At least in that regard.

The most noteworthy example is probably chapter 7 when Yamada and Shiraishi attempt to switch bodies but won't let Itou in on their secret. Every time they get close to kissing, Itou shows up and asks Yamada to help her with a new cleaning project.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading">Alternate Character Reading</a>:<ul><li> When Yamada has swapped bodies with Shiraishi in the first chapter and exclaims (in his thoughts) that he&#146;s turned into her, he uses the kanji for Shiraishi&#146;s name, but the furigana over the kanji read &#148;aitsu&#148; (&#148;that person&#148;/&#148;that girl&#148;) instead of &#147;Shiraishi&#148;.

This means that Yamada's love for Shiraishi originally was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">induced by magic and not real</span>. When Shiraishi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leaves Suzaku High during her third year, the magic is broken</span>, but Yamada still <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">misses her as all hell, meaning that his love for her is now genuine and not caused by any magic power</span>.

The result is that the characters - especially the women as Yoshikawa generally gives females more youthful designs than males - physically look like teenagers, but some of them gain more "adult" hairstyles; Itou grows her hair into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherlySideplait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherlySideplait">Motherly Sideplait</a>, Odagiri wears her hair in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimAndProperBun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimAndProperBun">Prim and Proper Bun</a>, Noa wears her hair in circular ponytails instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">Girlish Pigtails</a>, Yamada and Miyamura have started to actually comb their hair, and Ushio has grown a goatee and has a receding hairline.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a>: A minor one in Noa's arc.

Why didn't he even tell her about this plot? Could he not trust her?

This goes for both their faces and their bodies: Their faces are more "cutesy" with less pronounced noses, and their bodies are more shapely (note how Shiraishi could look flat-chested in certain panels/from certain perspectives even though she is relatively busty, and how the girls' legs sometimes looked awfully thin compared to their hips).</li><li> Characters are drawn with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyVisibleEyebrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyVisibleEyebrows">Oddly Visible Eyebrows</a> for the second witch war and onward which they weren't at the start.</li><li> The light area of the characters' irises is drawn much bigger which give them a more realistic, but less "shiny" look.</li><li> The male characters' faces also become more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishonen-like</a>, especially due to bigger eyes and irises.

The series surprisingly doesn't end fter that, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after the ritual that erased the original witch powers, seven new witches arise. Then it is revealed in chapter 110 that another set of "new" witches had their powers <em>before</em> the ritual which means they are <em>not</em> the new seven witches.

However, the trope comes in as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil">Absurdly Powerful Student Council</a>; apparently, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> can just hand out recommendations for students who have made noteworthy contributions to the school (student council vice-presidents and seventh witches among others) so they automatically can get admitted to a more average university.

They Really Do Love Each Other</a>: Despite her cold demeanor, Shiraishi really does care about Yamada and truly trusts him, to the point when she does not even bother to ask him why he wants to swap into her body. This is further demonstrated when she demands to include him in her camping group and says that she enjoys school now because of him. Yamada himself admits that he is in love with her, and they end up dating.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odagiri and Ushio and Yamada and Shiraishi each have two children by the story's end.

Especially the scene when Yamada tries to get back with old friends who have forgotten him by talking about underwear, but they reject him, can be considered to be one of the most hilarious <em>and</em> one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the series all at once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomStallOfOverheardInsults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomStallOfOverheardInsults">Bathroom Stall of Overheard Insults</a>:<ul><li> Shiraishi's trio of friends have their last appearance when they badmouth Odagiri in the girls' bathroom... only for Odagiri to appear from a stall.

It looks like Yamada and Shiraishi are going to kiss on the beach of Guam, but then she gives him a peck on the cheek instead, not wanting to kiss him as long as he has the precognition power because she fears that he may get a vision of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>.

Because of that, the first romantic kiss between Yamada and Shiraishi (when they become a couple) averts it and is as cutely awkward as some people's first kiss in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> can be, with their teeth colliding and all. On the other hand, the kiss between Leona and Yamazaki at the end of the former's flashback is a straight example since it both has the romantic intentions and the "epic" feel/look.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>: Shiraishi lives in one, and the same goes for Miyamura and Leona. The "fancy" part is most obvious with the Miyamura family's Western-styled house.

When Odagiri tries to blackmail Yamada by saying she'll share a photo of him sneaking around the girls' room on the field trip (actually Shiraishi in his body), Yamada stands his ground by telling a half-truth that he actually just went to get Shiraishi's books for her, and Odagiri can just ask Shiraishi to confirm it. The subversion comes when Odagiri then shows a photo of "Yamada" holding Shiraishi's panties, and Yamada realizes he has no excuse to get out of that one, after which he's forced to give in to Odagiri's demands.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Bland-Name Product</a>: Happens several times with the food and drinks the characters are consuming:<ul><li> Usually you have to look closely into the background to see the altered brand name, but one more obvious and hilarious example is in chapter 94 when Shiraishi brings Yamada snacks and coffee of a brand called "Starsocks". The logo has the Starbucks mermaid replaced with a sock with a star on top. Itou also uses a computer of the brand "Mec".</li><li> On one cover page, Shiraishi reads a book titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye">The Catcher in the Soy</a></em> by "D.J.

While the arcs up to Sarushima Arc are more or less well adapted, leaving out some explanation about Saeushina's power and Karen Kimishima (although it seems that the event of Yamada with Kimishima seems to happen offscreen, considering his interaction toward her in OVA2), Noa's arc clearly suffered the most with a lot of plot and characterization cut out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConnectedAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConnectedAllAlong">Connected All Along</a>: Leona with Yamazaki and Rika.

The next chapter, 239, goes out of its way to wrap up all remaining mysteries regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiraishi</span>, so you'd think the next four chapters would do the same.

In the English translation, it is changed to Yamada threatening a girl into prostitution, probably because fewer Western readers would know what compensated dating is. The implication is also prostitution in the original Japanese edition, given that Shiraishi is shown in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> sitting half-naked on a bed while Yamada counts money.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>: Anyone who tries to fight Asuka will be succumbed to this, as Tamaki and Yamada among others can attest (though Yamada did get in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompCushion">Curb-Stomp Cushion</a> in his first fight with Asuka when he grabbed her from behind and put her under the charm power).

Several characters have at least had their moms mentioned or briefly seen, but the only dads known are Yamada's (who seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">bumbling</a> as he spends all of New Year's Eve drunk on a bar) and Miyamura's (who is never home because of his work) - and none of them have made physical appearances.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw">Discard and Draw</a>: Witch-killer powers work like this.

There's a lot of stuttering, lines like "it's a long story" and "I think you already know", and both of them (especially Yamada) look like they're on the verge of tears. Of course, the real reason is harmless: Yamada forgot he had to go on the student council's winter trip the same day as the date.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>: Two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Texts</a> at the end of the chapters which are removed when the chapters are released in volumes:<ul><li> At the end of chapter 14, Kimishima has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">Panty Shot</a> when flipping Yamada over.

None of the guys have ever beaten her up, and given the size difference it probably wouldn't be played for laughs if it happened.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a>: The first time Yamada asked Shiraishi to take some exams in his place, she scored just one point below perfect just to show off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning">Downer Beginning</a>: While the comedic beat is the same as in the rest of the series, the story does start at the lowest point of both Yamada and Shiraishi's lives, with them being loners without any friends or purpose in life. Their lives start to get better once they befriend each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoYouWantToCopulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoYouWantToCopulate">Do You Want to Copulate?</a>: G-rated example in that almost everybody either start out having almost no qualms at all about kissing or end up having no qualms. Even the ones who do have standards for who/when they want to kiss are still not <em>that</em> inhibited and always end up kissing Yamada. Shiraishi also seems to be an example when it comes to actual sex, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">not minding being seen naked</a> and being confused as to why Yamada refuses to have sex with her in public in front of a schoolmate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>: Asuka who is Yamazaki's right-hand woman and swaps body with Urara in order to hold her as a hostage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">Drunk on the Dark Side</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Konno temporarily suffers from this.

Yamada complies, but not without a bit of bad conscience.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungFu">Dung Fu</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Odagiri</a> is the victim of this when she gets a bit too close to the monkeys in the zoo.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">Dysfunction Junction</a>: The Supernatural Studies Club. The first four members (Tsubaki isn't known for sure, though he's not shown hanging out with anyone but the club members) had no friends and their own unique problems when they joined. The same goes for most of the witches and the rest of the cast: It almost seems like it's a requirement that you have no or very few real friends and a troubled/different life if you want to befriend Yamada. The club and the new student council double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">ragtag bunches of misfits</a>.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E - K&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arisugawa, Kurosaki, Nancy, Sid, Yamada's mom, and even the owner of Shiraishi's local bookstore</span> make cameos in the second OVA even before their proper introduction.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>:<ul><li> As the image caption shows, the original splash-page illustration showed some characters who have yet to show up after over 100 chapters, unless they were early designs for ones who did appear later.</li><li> The first chapter can feel a bit weird on a re-read with how much emotion Shiraishi shows in that chapter. Granted, she is stoic most of the time, and much of the humor derives from her underreactions to Yamada and the body-swap, but she still has more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a> moments in this chapter than in the entire rest of the series &#150; especially when she angrily shouts at Yamada that he shouldn&#146;t meddle with her problems, and when she is comically crying because Yamada hit her. It seems like her character concept was changed from &#147;stoic girl who will abruptly show full emotion in extreme cases&#148; to &#147;less stoic but calmer and harder to read&#148;.</li><li> The first few chapters were much more similar to Yoshikawa&#146;s former series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlunkPunkRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlunkPunkRumble">Flunk Punk Rumble</a></em> in terms of atmosphere and world-building &#150; we got to see students from other schools and teachers, and there were more delinquent-caused street fights. Later on, especially after the existence of the witches is revealed, the series takes its own direction &#150; it focuses solely on Suzaku High students with teachers and students from other schools being completely absent, and the conflicts become more psychological. There are still many similarities between the two series (kind of inevitable when they share the same writer and overall genre), but they are less pronounced.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a>: To cite Miyamura, Yamazaki was the "smarmiest bastard he ever met" and apparently injured people to end up a club. During his time as the President and Yamada's main antagonist, he enforces ruthless policies, wiping minds on the go and allowing Asuka to lock Yamada down and <em>torture him</em>.

Miyamura likes Yamada to begin with, which is kicked into overdrive when he is under the influence of Nene's powers. Yamada is fine with kissing himself, or random guys at the cultural festival. A few characters are explicitly straight or at least prefer the opposite sex more, but they are the exception and not the rule.

Contrasting many other Japanese works, however, the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss">Sacred First Kiss</a> is often averted or downplayed, and the only ones whose first kissing partner has been confirmed are Yamada (with Shiraishi - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">subverted as it's actually with Seishuin</span>), Shiraishi (with Yamada), Takuma (with Yamada), and Himekawa (with Yamada).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfGenderBending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfGenderBending">First Law of Gender-Bending</a>: Averted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBending">Gender Bending</a>, or more precisely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a>, is mostly a mean to an end and it gets the most usage only because it's the Witch power most readily available to the main cast and a relatively harmless way to protect them from other Witch powers as two of them can't affect the same target at once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a>: The Supernatural Studies Club:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a>: Yamada, copying power and being the best asset.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a>: Shiraishi, the president and Yamada's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a>: Tsubaki, stronger than Yamada and Miyamura together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">The Smart Guy</a>: Miyamura, in charge of plans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a>: Itou, who - despite her tendencies to complain and criticize the others - also has her heart in the right place and helps keep up the team spirit thanks to her enthusiasm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthRanger">The Sixth Ranger</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hikaru, who joins much, much later than the five other members.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackEffects">Flashback Effects</a>: The series uses the typical manga effects; black panel spaces in longer flashbacks and greyed-out panels in brief flashbacks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackNightmare">Flashback Nightmare</a>: The power of Noa, which lets people see the traumatic events in someone's past after they fall asleep.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenChekhovsGun">Forbidden Chekhov's Gun</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Nancy lets Yamada copy her memory manipulation power, she warns him to never actually use it, instead only letting it function as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfDamocles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfDamocles">Sword of Damocles</a>.

Exactly how it will happen is never explained, as it's among the visions negated by the body-swap power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Event</a>: Of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious">The Comically Serious</a> type. In the chapter where Itou joins the Supernatural Studies Club, she tries to impress the club by showing off her "supernatural" possessions (which are just things like normal rocks, spoons etc.). Yamada and Miyamura listen to her and have several funny reaction shots to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>, while Shiraishi doesn't join in. Then, in one panel, she appears in the background, reading a book and looking as somber as ever. Apparently, Itou's antics were so stupid that the serious Shiraishi didn't even bother to react, just retracting to the background instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuroScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuroScene">Furo Scene</a>: The winter trip has a short one, involving the male student council members (the girls bathed in the hot springs instead), though there is one girl with them as Odagiri has swapped bodies with Yamada without telling anyone. It leads to a hilarious moment when she gets completely flushed from seeing Miyamura full-frontal naked, and Miyamura simply thinks that Yamada is getting red because the water is too hot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gang of Bullies</a>: Tacchan and his two friends make up one of these when they bully Hikaru by beating him up and humiliating him.

As they are joined by more students they all start trying out the body swapping. The series is often considered part of the gender-bendering genre because of the significance Yamada and Shiraishi's swaps have in the early part of the series, but the body-swapping gets less and less important later on, and it practically disappears from the story when Shiraishi loses her power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a>: In line with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a> trope. Miyamura is supposedly very handsome, while Yamada is implied to be plain or even a bit ugly - at least it isn't his appearance that makes the girls fall for him. But they both have the same face and body, except for Miyamura being maybe an inch taller. The same with Shiraishi and Itou: Itou is stated to be pretty, but not out of the ordinary. Shiraishi is seen by many as the school's most beautiful girl. They <em>also</em> have the same face and similar bodies (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">though Shiraishi has bigger breasts than Itou</a> so at least there's that difference).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">Genre Roulette</a>: The series is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool">High School</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Comedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Comedy">Comedy</a> all the way through, but otherwise it rotates between a whole lot of side-genres: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy">Romantic Comedy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryFiction">Mystery Fiction</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi">Ecchi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanormalInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanormalInvestigation">Paranormal Investigation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenDrama">Teen Drama</a> among others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic">Geometric Magic</a>: The ceremony with the seven witches involves them standing in a circle equidistant from each other and the castor in the center.

Takuma's witch group, the male witches, are the Bad Witches as several of them are on Ushio's side to help <em>him</em> initiate a ceremony. It's seen in their general personalities: All of Nancy's witches are friendly, the worst of them being Nancy herself who can be somewhat ill-tempered, but is still good-hearted. Of Takuma's witches, two of them are villains, Takuma himself is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a> working with the villains, and the only heroic one is still a bit of a jerk</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaPassTheClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaPassTheClass">Gotta Pass the Class</a>: Yamada tends to fail his end-of-term exams which usually results in him having to go to summer school or otherwise take a make-up exam.

It is, however, a fairly peaceful outing compared to most examples of the trope, with the zoo mostly being used for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> about their interest in completely mundane animal traits (Yamada comments the animal's color, Ushio comments the animal's size, Himekawa comments the animal's legs, and Odagiri, who doesn't like animals, doesn't get what the fuss is about).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">Hoist by Their Own Petard</a>:<ul><li> Nene's plans fall apart when her power is used against her.</li><li> The President having everyone's memory erased of Yamada ends up coming back to bite him as the Witches abuse their power and go back to their old ways.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingHands">Holding Hands</a>: Chapter 120 ends with Yamada trying to hold Shiraishi's hand as his first attempt of moving further in their relationship.

Later, we find out that he has <em>not</em> lost his memory. He was simply confused by the fact that his memory was intact.

For example, only after Yamada <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copies</a> another Witch power, him and Shiraishi figured out that <em>she</em> was a Witch the whole time.

Usually Yamada is the victim. One time Yamada gets to be the one to remark on the hypocrisy of Nene making fun of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Midori</span> because of her big boobs by pointing out that it's not like she's small herself.

Yamazaki realizes this as well and makes her an offer to be with Yamada if she stops helping him gather the witches. She confesses to Tamaki that she told Yamazaki to stuff it because she knows that Yamada is in love with Shiraishi and she'd rather enjoy what time they have together than be a nuisance to him.

However, the truth is the eraser is in good condition because Yamada never used it due to his aversion to schoolwork, and as such he never read the greeting.

Because the main protagonist is a guy, and some of the other prominent characters are male, the male characters get just as much screen-time as the female ones, so the gender distribution may seem less skewed than it is, but it's actually pretty skewed.

A variation in that Yamada is just as oblivious as the readers to the fact that the story starts this way: He thinks for most of the story that his days of being bored and miserable ended, and his fun school life started, when he met Shiraishi, and it takes him more than 150 chapters to realize that he has his lost his memories of his first year</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: Yamada and Shiraishi (especially the former) decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">pay tribute</a> to none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Ross Geller</a> when they insist that they didn't "break up" during the time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiraishi was under the provocation power</span> - they were "on a break".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">Intelligence Equals Isolation</a>: Shiraishi was a loner and bullied by other girls before she met Yamada.

In the last few arcs, the only kisses shown are the kisses that have an emotional impact on at least one of the involved characters and kisses that are meant as comic relief (for example Miyamura suddenly forcing his lips on Yamada's) - non-emotional kisses that are simply done to let Yamada copy witch powers are always off-screened.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L - R&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePunReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePunReaction">Lame Pun Reaction</a>: Yamada, Odagiri and Tamaki give very exasperated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance">Aside Glances</a> when Rika makes a bad pun that she's in the science room because "science" sounds similar to "Rika" (this joke only works in Japanese - in the translation, she just says that students are equally likely to forget her and science, which is still a bit of a bad joke, but probably doesn't deserve the exasperated reaction).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection">Landslide Election</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tamaki wins the president election by a landslide; presumably he got every single vote because Ushio wiped everybody's memories of Ichijo, the other candidate, right before the voting.

This is heavily toned down for the last chapters, and though panty shots or boob jokes may slip in once a while, they're not as openly fanservicey or in-your-face as they used to be. It's especially noteworthy to compare one of the first hot spring scenes, in which Yamada (in Shiraishi's body) and Odagiri strut around completely in the nude (albeit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">Barbie Doll Anatomy</a>), with the last hot spring scene in which Yamada (again in Shiraishi's body) and Himekawa are completely covered up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyTowel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyTowel">Modesty Towels</a>, even when washing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In chapter 96, when Yamada and Shiraishi go into a sappy, romantic mode and kiss each other again and again, Kurosaki suddenly appears and tells them this isn't a girls' manga where they can "play kissy-face".

In the epilogue, they appear together, but are simply mentioned to "get along well".

Tsubaki falls in love with Itou after getting over his hopeless crush with Shiraishi, but she doesn't notice or reciprocate it during high school.

Yamada constantly worries that something he's doing - for example needing to kiss other witches and hang out with Himekawa in the handicrafts club - will hurt Shiraishi, but it always turns out that Shiraishi isn't bothered in the least, and she even gives him some encouraging words. Reversely, the one time when Shiraishi <em>is</em> hurt by something Yamada did - spending too much time in the student council and not enough time with her - Yamada is oblivious to notice that it might be a problem.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniatureSeniorCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniatureSeniorCitizens">Miniature Senior Citizens</a>: The older teachers of Suzaku High are all very short, the tallest of them reaching to the shoulders of the students.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyTowel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyTowel">Modesty Towel</a>: The characters always wear these when entering hot springs, but whether or not we see them without the towel varies - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Odagiri</a> has been shown naked a few times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome">Himekawa</a> not so much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>: Rika's arc regularly inserts wackiness into even the most grim moments, but also makes some comedic scenes suddenly take a turn for the worse. The rest of the series is a downplayed example as it stays lighthearted all the time, but still doesn't shy away from randomly adding drama to comedy (and vice versa), just the same way as mangas like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> do it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>: Kimishima gets into one such situation shortly after her introduction.

However, to do this they need to have all of the club presidents vote in favor of the new construction at a meeting. Kimishima strongly wants to vote against the development because she wants to fulfill a tradition in her clubroom which involves finishing the strokes of the character "shingi ittai" on a wall next time she wins a tournament. Odagiri, wanting to curry favor in the student council, has her henchman Ushio lock Kimishima inside the clubroom with Yamada and Miyamura right before the meeting. Yamada realizes that the only way to get out of the room is to tear down the "shingi ittai" wall since the other walls are reinforced. In short; if they tear down the wall, Kimishima can go to the meeting and vote no, but that won't mean anything since she already lost the thing that made her want to vote no, and if they stay inside the room, everyone else will vote yes, and the wall (and room) will be torn down anyway. Fortunately, Yamada <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">takes another option</a> by putting the last stroke on the character and having Kimishima promise that she'll win her next tournament.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>: Nene gets a lot of shots of naked skin and underwear, although it's always unintentional.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBestFriend">Muggle Best Friend</a>: Miyamura and Itou (and later Tsubaki) have no powers, regardless the club members grow very close.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySignificanceSenseIsTingling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySignificanceSenseIsTingling">My Significance Sense Is Tingling</a>: More like genuine female intuition than a supernatural power, but in chapter 90 Nene was able to perceive the moment when Yamada and Shiraishi hooked up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySkullRunnethOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySkullRunnethOver">My Skull Runneth Over</a>: A very mild version; if a memory-wiped person gets his/her memories restored, they will need to sleep in order for their brain to process all of this new information. In some characters' case, like Leona, it simply results in them becoming very tired, but in Yamada and Otsuka's case, they outright drop asleep.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousAnimalSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousAnimalSenses">Mysterious Animal Senses</a>: Shiraishi's cat is able to tell that Yamada in Shiraishi's body is not the real Shiraishi, as mentioned by a side note and shown by how it becomes really aggressive and starts hissing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback">Necessary Drawback</a>: As pointed out by Odagiri, most witch powers have at least one of these, and that's the reason why the witches generally aren't nigh-unstoppable.

The lack of necessary drawbacks was why Odagiri considered <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Konno's</span> power to be so dangerous; because it has to be manually activated after the kiss, and because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she just plain controls people without affecting their emotions</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil">Necessary Evil</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Since she started having feelings about Yamada, Shiraishi has held this view about Yamada kissing people.

In fact, this was one of the main reasons Yamada was appointed secretary - to see which students who didn't treat him unfairly, in order to make sure that the new student council members wouldn't be impartial.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist">No Antagonist</a>: After the second witch war, there are no lasting antagonists for the rest of the series, and the obstacles are simply the troubles that the characters go through to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">recover the lost memories</span>.

Fans tend to pronounce her name "Shee-rye-shee", when it's really more like "Shee-rah-ee-shee" (because her name is the words "shira" (white) and "ishi" (stone) put together) - so it might be to connote the actual pronunciation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed">Nosebleed</a>: Par for the course almost every time a male character sees some naked skin, gets physically close to a girl or has dirty fantasies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>: Witches' powers don't work on Yamada.

Fitting for a room that looks like a church. In other appearances, it's the same size as the student council office (which itself also varies in size from about twice as big as a regular clubroom to twice as big as a regular <em>classroom</em>, but usually somewhere in inbetween).</li><li> The room of the Supernatural Studies Club is always fairly small, but it varies from scene to scene whether the table takes up almost the entire room, or if there's some available floor space.</li><li> The poetry clubroom is notably bigger than the room of the Supernatural Studies Club (and it's mentioned that the clubrooms in the new school building are bigger than the old clubrooms) during its first appearance, but in later appearances it's about the same size as the Supernatural Studies Club.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">Nothing Is the Same Anymore</a>: After over eighty chapters, major changes to the status quo arise after all seven witches are gathered for a ritual in the same place.

When he's about to kiss Yamada, Miyamura - whom he has a hopeless crush on - walks in. Kurosaki panics and yells that it was not what it looked like, although Miyamura indifferently says "I don't care what you're doing" (he usually gets excited when there's romance in the air) which suggests he knew what they were doing.</li><li> Played straight and for drama in Rika's arc when Yamada needs to kiss Odagiri to copy her charm power. Shiraishi sees them kissing, and due to having forgotten about Yamada and the witches, she does indeed think they are kissing for romantical reasons. Her conscious mind tells her that she shouldn't care since she doesn't know them, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImCryingButIDontKnowWhy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImCryingButIDontKnowWhy">her unconsciousness makes her cry</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Notzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Notzilla">Notzilla</a>: Yamazaki mentions that he skipped his university classes to see a popular movie about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">a giant lizard monster</a> named "Godzoola".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily">Nuclear Family</a>: Yamada and Miyamura both live in homes consisting of a mom, a dad, a son and a daughter, although Miyamura's family is slightly more dysfunctional than Yamada's. Averted with Shiraishi and Itou; Shiraishi doesn't have any siblings, and Itou has divorced parents and is indicated to have no siblings either. Tsubaki is a vague case as while he lives with both of his parents, we don't know if he has siblings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumericalThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumericalThemeNaming">Numerical Theme Naming</a>: For the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Male Witches</span>:<ul><li> One: Masamune <strong>Ichi</strong>jo</li><li> Two: Jin Kurosaki (Jin(&#20161;) contains radical for two)</li><li> Three: Yuri <strong>Mi</strong>ura</li><li> Six: Hikaru Suzuhara (Hikaru contains radical for six)</li><li> Seven: Rui Takuma (Taku(&#35435;) contains radical for seven)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>:<ul><li> Yamada is kind of dense about the matter, as his focus is only on Shiraishi, he doesn't realize if other girls are infatuated with him.</li><li> Nene is also oblivious to Tamaki's crush on her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OcularGushers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OcularGushers">Ocular Gushers</a>: When the characters cry for the sake of comedy, they cry like this, with thick streams of tears running from their eyes and sometimes also snot running from their noses to combine the trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering">Inelegant Blubbering</a>. When they cry in serious scenes, they cry more realistically with a few separate tears.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyVisibleEyebrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyVisibleEyebrows">Oddly Visible Eyebrows</a>: Averted for the first many chapters. The trope starts being used when Rika - whose eyebrows are covered by her bangs - needs to convey feelings. It soon starts being used on other characters with bangs, and it doesn't take long before all characters' eyebrows are Oddly Visible in every single panel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>: It took long enough for it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">actually happen</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCoupleOrdealSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCoupleOrdealSyndrome">they still have their ups and downs</a>, but it's become abundantly clear at this point that no power on Earth can sink the ship that is Yamada/Shiraishi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCoupleOrdealSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCoupleOrdealSyndrome">Official Couple Ordeal Syndrome</a>: After Yamada and Shiraishi become a couple, they can't seem to have a normal romantic relationship for more than a few chapters until something comes up to spoil their relationship, after which this something must be solved. However, since they're so happy together, it's almost always external circumstances that keep them apart rather than emotional issues, for example Yamada being too busy in the student council, Shiraishi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing her memories of Yamada</span>, and finally Shiraishi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">moving away</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>: There is often a noteworthy art-style difference between the characters (which are presumably drawn by Yoshikawa herself) and the backgrounds/inanimate objects (which seem to be drawn by her assistants). The latter are drawn with softer, thinner lines and look more photorealistic - but also somewhat less dynamic - than the characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Offscreen Moment of Awesome</a>: Shiraishi's birthday party on the winter trip.

It may or may not be intentional as they are both fortunetellers - but while Gagada is a fraud, Chikushi is a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">real witch who has an actual precognition power</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>: Yamada himself. Except for a few of his more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> moments, he actually seems to be the character with the most common sense and the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy">Meta Guy</a> reactions, even if he isn't the smartest person out there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a>: There may be subtle differences here and there, like some characters have slightly bigger eyes or rounder heads, but in general you would have a <em>very</em> hard time differentiating most characters' faces if their signature hairstyles were switched around. This goes for the guys as well as the girls. This adds some odd subtext to the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nancy is someone from Yamada's past, though he doesn't remember her</span> - due to the art style, she looks exactly like Shiraishi and slightly to Odagiri when she lets her hair down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The latter is actually plot point with Yamada mistook her for Odagiri as the girl that he and Ushio rescued.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>:<ul><li> All the students started freaking out immediately when they noticed Yamada was studying seriously.</li><li> Miyamura after his memories are wiped of Yamada being his friend, sees his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> sister asks Yamada in, doesn't object when Nene and Tamaki barge in, and hears his sister laugh for the first time in a long time.

Seeing Shiraishi doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoundhouseKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoundhouseKick">Roundhouse Kick</a> made Miyamura realize it was actually Yamada in Shiraishi's body.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">Panty Shot</a>: These tend to happen when Yamada is in a female body and pulls off a kick. Kimishima does one when she flips Yamada. The narration helpfully advises girls not to flip people while wearing skirts to avoid this. Saionji willingly does the other witches and Tamaki during the time stop portion of the ceremony. Nancy also subjects everyone else in the room besides Yamada to this when they both perform the ceremony to get his missing memories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a>: Chapter 232 is about this. The third years are retiring from the Supernatural Studies Club and need to find a new president to carry on the club (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClubStub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClubStub">also so that the club won't be shut down</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerceptionFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerceptionFilter">Perception Filter</a>: The power of Mikoto Asuka until Tamaki took it from her, which makes anyone that gets kissed be incapable of seeing or otherwise noticing that person.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicKissing">Platonic Kissing</a>: Given that the series is about using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKiss">magic powers through kisses</a>, platonic kisses happen much more often than romantic kisses - though the fact that the kiss is technically platonic doesn't necessarily prevent any of the participants from being awkward about it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny">Playboy Bunny</a>: Yamada (in Shiraishi's body) wears one such costume during his sleepover with Itou - just one of Itou's innumerable weird or skimpy costumes. Odagiri is also made to be a Playboy bunny in the never-translated "Yamada and Yamazaki" omake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a>: The series has a fair amount of them, all the way from scenes that simply seem a bit contrived to scenes that outright defy the rules already established by the series:<ul><li> Despite that the series uses a few chapters on defining Sarushima's power and its rules clearly (you only see a short glimpse of your future, you can only see a future involving yourself, you see your future from the kissee's point of view, and you cannot change the future unless you use another witch power in your attempt to do so), it is subject to more inconsistencies than the other powers, especially in later arcs. Among others:<ul><li> When Yamada acted as a fortuneteller at the culture festival, how did he see Ushio receiving an indirect kiss from Odagiri? The indirect kiss was Odagiri taking a bite out of a yakisoba bread and then giving the bread to him, but Yamada wasn't present at that scene.</li><li> The sad future in which Shiraishi becomes unlucky because she is made student council secretary: Sarushima appears in the vision, but since Yamada gets the vision from kissing her, she shouldn't be visible at it's from her point of view. Also, this vision is way too long to be considered a "short glimpse".</li></ul></li><li> When Yamada used the charm power on the amnesiac Miyamura in order to be invited to his house, it shouldn't have worked since Miyamura was still under invisibility power at the time. Of course, it is very much possible that Tamaki lifted the spell off-screen because he had lost the president race and didn't need to use dirty tricks anymore, but it isn't explained in-universe at all.</li><li> Similarly to the above, it's sometimes forgotten whose power is used on who:<ul><li> One of Otsuka's friends, Tsurukawa, and Kimishima are later established to be in the same class as Kotori who has used her power on every single one of her classmates. And yet, Tsurukawa is obviously under Otsuka's power (until she loses it), and Kimishima wasn't under any power at the culture festival since Yamada was able to tell her future in the fortune-teller stand - the only explanation being that Kotori discovered her power very recently.</li></ul></li><li> The bonus chapter about Yamada and Itou&#146;s sleepover is clearly part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a> since it has been referenced several times in the actual story, but the plot hole comes from how it doesn&#146;t seem to fit anywhere in the timeline. It takes place after Tsubaki joins the club, and after the new term has started, but clearly before Rika&#146;s mind-wipe occurs. Problem is that every single day between the start of the new term and the meeting with Rika is covered, and the characters are way too busy with other things for the events of the bonus chapter to realistically be able to take place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotMandatedFriendshipFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotMandatedFriendshipFailure">Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure</a>:<ul><li> Happens in the first witch war, though as a more justified case than most given that the reason for the friendship failure is that Yamada's friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">forget everything about him</a>. They are very cold towards him at first and only truly warm up to him again when their memories return.</li><li> Subverted in the second first war; Nancy predicts that this trope might happen by saying that Miyamura's most important task is to ensure that Yamada remains loyal, alluding to the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yamada may find out about the lost memories sooner or later and help the Japanese chess club recovering them</span>. Nothing bad happens because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yamada only focuses on recovering his own memories, and Miyamura remains supportive to him</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor">Plot Tumor</a>: The memory manipulation power. In the first witch war, the memory wipe is - though an important part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Yamazaki's backstory - mostly a final obstacle for Yamada to overcome, and the overall plot focuses more on his relationship to Shiraishi and the other witches. By the second witch war and onwards, the story is all about memory manipulation; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> memories are wiped left and right for a multitude of reasons, everybody is revealed to have lost their memories at some point or another in past, all characters try to ally with the seventh witches so that they effectively control the memory wipes, and the ceremony is relegated to a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice">Plot Device</a> for returning memories.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a>: What Yamada's power turns out to be. Effectively this makes him the only person who can use their powers on a Witch.

The ceremony can only be held in a room that looks like a church nave, the witches have to stand in a prayer-like circle and join hands, they have to stand on a pentagram that is hidden under an altar (although Rika points that the pentagram itself is just for show, and the witches just have to stand in the circles), and the first ceremony ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaysFromHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaysFromHeaven">a huge beam of sunlight suddenly penetrating the window</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatingSoTheAudienceCanHear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatingSoTheAudienceCanHear">Repeating So the Audience Can Hear</a>: The series is an offender of this to an almost ridiculous degree when it comes to exposition.

Yet, she has also admitted that she ignores her research when she thinks lack of realism will make a situation much funnier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">Rule of Symbolism</a>:<ul><li> When Leona tells Yamada of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> he is facing regarding meeting the seventh witch, a pair of scales that hasn't been seen before suddenly appears on her desk, and she moves a coin from one scale to another. Probably to signify that even though both options are weighing down on Yamada, one of them may be weighing down even heavier. This symbolism isn't commented on in-universe and really doesn't make much sense, but doesn't feel out-of-place in that particular scene.</li><li> When Yamada sends Shiraishi a text message, apologizing for how he stupidly missed her signals of wanting to have sex with him, it is shown that her text message display background is... a bunch of cherries.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>:<ul><li> Kimishima flipping Yamada every time they meet.</li><li> Seishuin brutally kissing Yamada every time he needs to copy her power, leaving him bruised and with a disheveled shirt.</li><li> Yamada being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">impossibly oblivious</a> to all of Odagiri's advances (he also has this trait with other girls, but it's exaggerated <em>a lot</em> more when he's around Odagiri).</li><li> Noa trying to get romantic favors from Yamada such as dates whenever he wants her help.</li><li> Itou's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spots</a>.</li><li> Yamada immediately, seemingly unconsciously, grabbing a girl's boobs after a body-swap. Similarly, any girl immediately looking at Yamada's genitals after a body-swap and deeply embarrassing him.</li><li> Yamada accidentally seeing some girls naked any time he enters a hot spring.</li><li> Whenever a character acts eccentric, it's common for a puzzled onlooker to ask "is he/she under [a witch power]?", after which another onlooker will reply "no, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">that's his/her normal behavior"</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S - Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss">Sacred First Kiss</a>:<ul><li> Interestingly averted. Both Shiraishi and Yamada say that the event that starts off the manga was their first kiss for both of them... But perhaps inevitably most characters in the manga take a more flexible view to kissing. As Miyamura points out, it's a small price to pay for being able to use Witch powers.</li><li> Played straight in Chapter 65. Shiraishi clearly treasured the fact that she was Yamada's first kiss. She wanted to stay close to him because she didn't want to risk handing that position to anybody else after he was supposed to lose his memories about it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>: Leona tells Yamada that he can choose not to meet the seventh witch and give Shiraishi an unhappy future, or he can choose to meet her and never see Shiraishi again because he will forget everything about her. He decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> by going for the "forget Shiraishi" option, but making sure to tell her about the amnesia beforehand so that she can find him and befriend him again.

When Yamada, Shiraishi, Noa's friends and Kaori are bullied and/or ostracized, it's played fairly seriously, and their bullies are given no sympathy, but Tacchan's bullying of Hikaru is a typical syrupy example where he eventually reveals that he just picked on (i.e. beated up and humiliated) Hikaru to cover up his own weaknesses, after which they become good friends. Kaori's bullying of Noa is a less black-and-white case where she does get off a bit easier than she should, but still gives Noa a heartfelt apology and tries to atone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolClubFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolClubFront">School Club Front</a>: A common trope in the series:<ul><li> The initial purpose of the Supernatural Studies Club is to have a room in which Yamada and Shiraishi can swap bodies without others looking. Later, the club is used for witch searching, and when the witch search is over, it simply becomes a place where the five friends can hang out. Itou's attempts to make the others do some actual studying of the supernatural beyond the witches are always shut down.</li><li> Nancy and Sid only use the light music club to keep track on the witches. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Nancy stops being the seventh witch, they do get new members and form a band, however.</span></li><li> The Japanese chess club members are smart enough to actually play Japanese chess on a high level in order to better hide their true purpose and not seem suspicious. Still, their true purpose is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to take over the student council and wish for everyone's memories to return.</span></li><li> When the new school year starts, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Noa and Ushio form a poetry club, and Takuma becomes the president and only member of the people-watching club. They don't actually care about club activities - Noa and Ushio just wanted to hang out in a comfortable room instead of the rooftop, and Takuma wanted a place to sleep, but they were all told that they couldn't have their own rooms unless they formed clubs.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a>: The culture festival, during which the Supernatural Studies Club has a stand with yakisoba bread and a fortuneteller house with Yamada making fortunes. The festival plays a quite big role in the sense that the preparations set up Noa's arc, and the festival itself sets up the entire rest of the first witch war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly">Schr&ouml;dinger's Butterfly</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the epilogue Yamada starts speculating that the witch powers may not have been real and they were just imagining anything related to them.

It's possible to change Sarushima's visions by using the power of another Witch. They attempt to use Shiraishi's to change the future where the old school building is burning down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalBaggage">Seasonal Baggage</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePassesMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePassesMontage">Time Passes Montage</a> variant. Most of Yamada's third year is skipped and simply shown by the trees losing leaves and snow appearing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfGenderBending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfGenderBending">Second Law of Gender-Bending</a>: Averted. Characters don't markedly enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBending">Gender Bending</a> more than they want to take another's place or vice versa. E.g.

Most noteworthily when Yamada sees Shiraishi falling down a flight of stairs and becoming severely hurt; she walks entirely normally down the stairs, but gets distracted by Yamada shouting warnings (not having any idea what he's warning her about), forgets to watch her step and falls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>: The manga looks like it's about to end after the first witch war, but there are in fact three clues that there are more plotlines left (the anime, which does end after the first witch war and doesn't cover the remainder of the manga, removes two of them):<ul><li> The first is the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ushio and Asuka are the only people who know of the witch powers who aren't invited into the Supernatural Studies clubroom to hear about the powers' disappearance</span>. And indeed, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reappear as villains in the second witch war</span>. In the anime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ushio is invited into the clubroom, though Asuka is still nowhere to be seen</span>.</li><li> The second is the mystery about why Ushio framed Yamada for the streetfight. In the manga, Shiraishi guesses that Ushio simply betrayed Yamada so that he and Odagiri could be left alone, but it's never confirmed, and Miyamura later points out that he's sure Ushio is hiding something. Furthermore, if you look close in the flashback, you can see that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the girl has a different hair color from Odagiri, which foreshadows that it wasn't Odagiri, but actually Nancy</span>. The mystery is later solved in the second witch war. In the anime, Miyamura's line is taken out, and in the flashback, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the girl is obviously Odagiri instead of Nancy</span>, meaning the mystery is solved right there.</li><li> The third is the fact that Yamada hasn't found out why he got his copy power, even after meeting all seven witches. The anime just ends before he finds out, and the manga <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also ends without him finding out, even though the mystery is brought up again in the second witch war</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">Series Fauxnale</a>: Nope, chapter 90 isn't the last chapter of the story, but you can easily pretend it is and stop reading there since almost all plot points have been resolved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unless you're interested in Ushio's not fully resolved character arc and you want to know who the girl in his and Yamada's flashback really was - then please read on.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesGoal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesGoal">Series Goal</a>:<ul><li> In the first part of the story: Find all seven witches and help them with any problems and sorrows they may have. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Rika, the seventh witch</a>, appears, it's changed to "bring back the memories of everyone Yamada knew so that he can have his old friends back and ask Shiraishi out" (though the first goal is still partly in effect since Yamada and co. need Rika's friendship to achieve the second).</li><li> In the second part of the story it is: Get the seventh witch on the student council's side since she can help keeping track on the other witches. That goal is reached fairly quickly, at least until another seventh witch appears...</li><li> Chapter 154 makes it clear that the overall goal of the entire series is, even though it's not mentioned often, to find out why Yamada has the copy power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted since Yamada never actually finds out.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot">Series Mascot</a>: Shoba, the yakisoba bread fairy, is starting to become this as of the second part of the story (he only appears briefly in the background in the first part) when he has several funny appearances. Yoshikawa also draws him a lot in non-canon artwork on her Twitter account. Going that Yamada isn't the only one to have Shoba-related merchandise (Noa also has a keychain), he's probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mascot">Mascot</a> for yakisoba bread in-universe as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>: Yamada only wants to get the club some funding because it meant he could get a microwave in the club room.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries">The Seven Mysteries</a>: Suzaku High has their own set, and one of them is the mystery of the Witches. Two of the others is the classic urban legend about Hanako-san and "the 13th stair after school". The last four aren't known.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexophone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexophone">Sexophone</a>: Referenced when Yamada tries to invite Shiraishi to stay the night; the recap states that "the sweet saxophones of sexy time" are playing in his mind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">Shameless Fanservice Girl</a>: Shiraishi doesn't really have any problems with Yamada seeing her naked when he is in her body - she has even directly asked him to take a bath for her. However, going by the general inexperience she claims to have when it comes to relationships and boys (not to mention an early chapter when she displays a rather childish curiosity around the "weird thing" Yamada and Miyamura have between their legs), she may be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">Innocent Fanservice Girl</a> instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>:<ul><li> Yamada and Shiraishi naturally get a lot of this before they become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>:<ul><li> Most of the time Shiraishi smiles, it's when she's around Yamada.</li><li> Shiraishi refuses to kiss Miyamura, but has no problem kissing Yamada (and Itou). But it should be noted that she doesn't have any problem with him kissing other people.</li><li> Shiraishi also seems irked that Yamada chose Itou instead of her during a school investigation.</li><li> A lot in Chapter 65. Shiraishi is resolute to sticking close to Yamada despite the danger, because she is determined to kiss him right after he loses his memory because she wants to be his first kiss again. She is determined that nobody should "swipe her spot."</li></ul></li><li> While Shiraishi and Yamada are the main source of ship tease until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">They Do</a>, they are certainly not the only ones. Yamada has had reasonable amounts of ship tease with every girl he's befriended, and even a couple of the guys. Of other characters, Odagiri and Tamaki actually get a substantial amount despite that Odagiri seems to be constantly lusting over Yamada. Itou also has some with Miyamura, and later with Tsubaki.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow">Shouldn't We Be in School Right Now?</a>: Downplayed since most of the story physically takes place in school, the cast are shown attending classes a couple of times, and make-up exams affect the plot now and then, but... Our protagonists seem to have an awful lot of time for extracurricular activities, often spending what seems like hours on looking for witches and talking in the clubroom. It's even worse with the student council where the members often seem to spend the whole day in the office even though they should still be taking classes. In fact, it looks like the president never attends classes and just sits at his desk all day - though since he is the highest authority of Suzaku, he may be exempted from normal school classes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>:<ul><li> Yamada's partners in the Light Music Club, Sid and Nancy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(who's one of the seventh witches)</span>, are an obvious one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen</a>. Being a nickname, Nancy is an intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example as well.</li><li> Yamada and Tsubaki's first names are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">"Ryu" and "Ken"taro</a>. The latter is also a gamer.</li><li> When Yamada and Itou are searching for the seventh witch in chapter 60, the first girl they interview is a "stereotypical witch" named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Aiko Gagada</a>".</li><li> Jin Kurosaki, one of the new Vice Presidents, is called an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin</a>" by Yamada in reference to his hoodie and demeanor.</li><li> When Yamada takes on the guise of the Masked DK as part of working off the 50,000 yen fee to kiss Aiko Chikushi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a witch who inherited Sarushima's power and uses it both to make money and fight crime as the Masked JK</span> his speech is very close to the one said by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderStronger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderStronger">Kamen Rider Stronger</a>.</li><li> The series' concept in general: There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSeven">seven</a> witches, and if you find all seven, bring them together and perform a special ritual, your greatest wish will come true. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">What other shonen manga has a similar concept</a>?

He then finds out it's because she was sick, and didn't want to get the teachers sick when turning in some papers. At the end of the episode, she's gotten better, but Yamada caught her cold. It's based on chapter 10 of the manga which features the same plotline but also shows Yamada, Miyamura and Itou experimenting with the body-swap power while Yamada is in Shiraishi's cold-ridden body.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a>: The whole Supernatural Club gets this vibe from Yamada and Noa Takigawa after the latter decides to stick a bit too close to him for a while. Mind you, Yamada constantly complains to her about it and he never once flirted back (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn">knowingly, that's it</a>), but it's just that his friends can tell he's being a lot nicer than they know he <em>could</em> be.

The New Year hijinks are also the only activities in the series that neither take place at school or are related to school (such as clubhouse trips or trying to get a drop-out to come back to school). After the second witch war, slice-of-life chapters without use or mention of witch powers regularly pop up, making those two chapters less weird in hindsight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a>: None of the witches are actually evil, but in the first witch war, each new witch causes a new problem that takes more effort and more chapters to solve than it took with the previous witch. Shiraishi's arc and problem was solved in one chapter. Odagiri's arc and problem in about five chapters. Otsuka's in about five chapters, too. Sarushima's in seven chapters. Noa's in about 10 chapters. Rika's in more than 20 chapters.

He reversed Nene's love kiss on her without knowing it would affect her, and it prompted character development in her. With his quest to undo the massive erasing of memories of the student population because he learned the seventh Witch's name. Then by helping Nene get her memories back, and the discovery the seventh Witch's power only works once, the Student Council President will put all of his attention on Yamada.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil">Speak of the Devil</a>: Anyone who finds out the Seventh Witch's name (with the exception of the President) will find themselves being forgotten by everyone else.

The language is also made much more explicit in other regards, for example Sarushima asked Yamada if he has a boner (in the original, she simply mentions he seems aroused) and Noa yelling at Yamada not to rape her (in the original, she simply yells at him not to come near her). In the original Japanese version, no harsher language than "kuso" ("crap") and "ketsu" ("ass") is used, and sex is almost only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualEuphemism">mentioned through euphemisms</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Spoiler Opening</a>: The opening of the anime shows all the key characters of the manga's first half, including the Seven Witches. The ending is even worse since it only showcases the witches and nobody else, while in the opening Leona is shown right after the witches in a way that can make it seem to an anime-only viewer that she is the last witch, thus not spoiling the surprise that Rika is the last witch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerTitle">Spoiler Title</a>: While the origin of the body-swap power in unknown in the first few chapters, the title still spoils that it may have something to do with "witches".

The series is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen">Sh&#333;nen</a> which means its audience is boys aged 8-18. However, <em>Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches</em> also exists in-universe as a book about Yamada's high school life that he reads aloud to his <em>three</em>-year-old son in the epilogue. While there's not anything in the story that would traumatize a three-year-old, most aspects of the humor (which is often mildly sexual) and intrigue (which is based on teenage drama) would probably fly over a toddler's head so you have to wonder why Yamada thought a kid that young would be the prime audience.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> Shiraishi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">unnamed</a> trio of friends don't appear after chapter 20. She may have stopped hanging out with them because they only knew and admired her as the girl who stopped the peepers (which was really Yamada), while the Supernatural Studies Club members know and respect Shiraishi's actual personality... but then again, she did seem to enjoy their company as she stayed awake all night to talk with them on the field trip. It's not known for sure why they stopped appearing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">When She Smiles</a>:<ul><li> Almost all of the antagonistic Witches give this to Yamada after some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">conflict-resolution occurs.</a></li><li> Shiraishi also fits this bill.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

Yamada is the series' king of wild takes and will usually have at least 5 in a given chapter. Other characters, like Odagiri and Tamaki, are also fond of doing them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Shiraishi</a> is the only major character who doesn't do wild takes, though once in a while she'll still have a cartoonishly dumbfounded gaze when she feels Yamada is being stupid.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>: Yamada and Shiraishi. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">They Do</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes">Wingding Eyes</a>: Female students in the background are often shown with hearts for eyes when Miyamura is around.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WistfulAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WistfulAmnesia">Wistful Amnesia</a>: As Noa Takigawa tells Yamada after recovering her memories in chapter 78:<div class="indent">What&#133; <em><strong>took</strong></em> you so long? <br>There's been this&#133; <em><strong>big</strong></em>, <em><strong>black hole</strong></em> in my heart. I was so confused. I couldn't understand why I would suddenly feel that way.</div><ul><li> And given Shiraishi's tears after Yamada kissed Nene she feels this too.</li><li> Later revealed President Yamazaki had his memories erased by Rika so he would forget about Leona. When they meet again a year later, despite not knowing who she is, he finds himself crying.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchWithACapitalB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchWithACapitalB">Witch with a Capital B</a>: In the English translation, once Yamada finds out how many yen Chikushi charges for a kiss and is thrown out of her clubroom for refusing to pay, he calls her a "money-hungry witch". In the original Japanese version, he simply calls her money-hungry, so the implication in the English translation is obvious. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">It slips through the radar</a> because she <em>is</em> a literal witch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt">Work Off the Debt</a>: When Yamada has no money to pay for a kiss, Chikushi is willing to let him work off the payment for a kiss by having him help her with her hero business.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBuxom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBuxom">World of Buxom</a>: Not as extreme as in certain other mangas, but most girls in the series have relatively large breasts, with only Itou (average), Noa and Himekawa (small), and Kotori (flat) serving as the exceptions. However, since the school uniform sweaters give a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBuxom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBuxom">Hidden Buxom</a>, it's usually not too obvious (except Arisugawa), mostly becoming apparent when the characters are shown in their underwear/bikinis/naked.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>: The series is full of emotion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> characters, over-the-top humor, shouting, loud declarations and all that sort of stuff. Even a calm and soft-spoken character like Shiraishi can sometimes seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdHam">hammy</a> from how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySerious">Comically Serious</a> she is. The major exception to the rule (at least some of the time) is Yamada and Shiraishi's relationship where a lot of the "d'aww" factor comes from the little moments (like Shiraishi writing a message on Yamada's eraser to make him smile) instead of grand romantic gestures.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenSoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenSoundEffect">Written Sound Effect</a>: The series loves using them, and it often becomes rather silly given that most of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSoundEffect">un-sound effects</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearsTooEarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearsTooEarly">Years Too Early</a>: According to Odagiri, Arisugawa is 10 years too young to wear sexy lingerie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Cue Yamada finding out that Arisugawa's underwear is actually much more scanty than Odagiri's</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">You Are Not Alone</a>: Yamada tells Rika Saionji this in chapter 82. She confesses that when her power activated, people forgot her. She was truly invisible to anyone and everyone, save the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>. He was the only one who could speak with her and be friends with her. That was what made her trust him. But then Yamada counters that Nene, Tamaki, and he also know about her and can be friends with her. She doesn't have to rely on the president to no longer be alone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious">You Called Me "X"; It Must Be Serious</a>: Inverted. When Miyamura and Leona were estranged from each other due to Leona being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">Hikikomori</a>, Miyamura called her by her name whenever he needed to talk to her. When she comes out of her shell again, he starts calling her by the more affectionate "sis".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFightLikeACow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFightLikeACow">You Fight Like a Cow</a>: Yamada and Ushio start their big fight on the roof by insultingly pointing out how their respective fighting skills have deteriorated since they were delinquents.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: The far majority of the characters have outlandish hair colors. The only characters with realistic hair colors are Shiraishi (light blonde), the Suzuhara twins (silvery blonde), Rika (strawberry blonde), Inose (dirty blonde), Kimishima (light blonde), Kurosaki (black), Kikuchi (light blonde), Himekawa (brown), and Sid (black).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMustBeCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMustBeCold">You Must Be Cold</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> during the winter trip. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Odagiri - who has swapped bodies with Yamada - tries to act the way a romantical boyfriend would do in front of Shiraishi. She concludes that she should do the things that she herself would want a boyfriend to do. One of these things is saying that Shiraishi must be cold and giving Shiraishi her hoodie (even though Shiraishi is already wearing a coat and a scarf), leaving her wearing only a t-shirt in freezing cold. Shiraishi subverts and returns the favor by saying that Odagiri must be the one who's cold and gives her the hoodie back along with her own scarf.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">Your Princess Is in Another Castle!</a>: Happens twice at the start of the second witch war:<ul><li> At the very start, shortly after the ceremony, Yamada and co. think all is well because the witches lost their powers and can't cause troubles for themselves or others anymore. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it turns out that a <em>new</em> witch group has been born...</span></li><li> Some chapters later, when Yamada has met and made friends with Nancy and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of her witch group</span>, it seems like the problem with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the new witches</span> was resolved easily and peacefully. Except that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nancy's group wasn't the new witches Yamada was looking for. They existed on the school all along.
