The fact that Shirogane managed to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> despite being 'impure' is considered very impressive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalContextChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalContextChange">Adaptational Context Change</a>: In the anime, there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">an extra scene</a> during the psychological test chapter where Hayasaka wears a paper cutout of Fujiwara's face so Kaguya has someone to practice one of her schemes against. The manga would eventually use a similar visual where she's talking to Kaguya while wearing a Shirogane mask, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though there she's secretly acting as an intermediary between her and Shirogane by relaying questions and answers to him via text message, allowing the two of them to unknowingly be completely honest with each other for the first time.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalLateAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalLateAppearance">Adaptational Late Appearance</a>: The Cubari Facaccimo, a bizarre one-eyed... thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements">that had something to do with Kaguya's plans for Valentine's day the previous year</a> appeared while the student council is cleaning up at the end of their first term. In the anime, it isn't seen until they're moving back in after the election.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The scene where the entire school gathers around to watch Shirogane "confess" to Kaguya (actually ask her help with his reelection campaign) has an added appearance of Karen and Erika reporting on it for the Mass Media club in the anime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication">Adaptation Explanation Extrication</a>:<ul><li> Due to the fact that Kaguya's first study session with Ishigami was moved to before Shirogane's birthday in the anime, it cuts out any mention of her doing so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebtDetester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebtDetester">due to owing him a favor</a> and she is instead simply trying to keep him for tarnishing the name of the student council and inconveniencing Shirogane.</li><li> In the manga, Ogino was forced to transfer out of Shuchi'in after Kaguya found out what he did and informed the school VIPs. The anime merely has Hayasaka ask Kaguya if she was responsible, but it never goes into any detail.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole</a>:<ul><li> In the anime, Kaguya and Ishigami's tutoring sessions happened in the span of one week before the second semester final exams. However, they still kept the "Ishigami plays games right before the exams" gag, despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Kaguya would never allow it while he was under her tutelage</a>. This plot hole doesn't exist in the manga, where the tutoring sessions were for a later test.</li><li> Hayasaka is shown looking at a series of photos while scolding Kaguya for her lack of progress with Shirogane in Episode 16, the last of which is from the moon viewing. While that picture does exist in the manga (having shown up when the student council put all their photos into a group album at the end of the Cell Phone arc), it's unclear how she got her hands on it given that Ishigami was presumably the one who took it and it's unlikely he would have shared it on social media for fear of Kaguya's wrath.</li><li> Chapter 10 has Fujiwara drawing on a (pretending to be) sleeping Shirogane as a prank, with the narrator explaining that the ability to do such things without fear of reprisal is a sign of closeness. Since that chapter was never adapted, it's never explained why Kaguya would choose to do such a thing to Ishigami during the lead up to the Sports Festival Arc.</li><li> Kashiwagi is shown to be on the White team during the sports festival in the anime despite the teams being broken up by what class you're in and everyone else in her class (her boyfriend, Shirogane, and Fujiwara) being on the Red team.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: The whole incident with Ishigami was only resolved thanks to Iino and the student council. If Kaguya hadn't alerted the council to investigate, Ishigami could have been left behind forever, as all the adults took Ogino's side and scolded Ishigami.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">Advertised Extra</a>: Karen, Erika, and Maki all show up in the opening of the first season, even though they barely show up and do nothing of consequence in the chapters that were adapted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: The overall point of the series is that relationships are built upon communication and that there's no way to go about them without risking emotional pain. Kaguya and Shirogane's relationship hit a wall for a year because they couldn't muster up the courage to change the status quo. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They confess eventually and openly communicate their feelings after a really long time and much better off than before, showing it was mostly a waste of time.</span> Maki lost her chance for the boy she liked because she couldn't talk to him. Ishigami and especially Tsubasa, on the other hand, seem to be doing well after their confessions even though their target didn't feel the same way at first, especially Tsubasa... not that Ishigami meant to confess. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ishigami eventually gets rejected, but he is still in a better state now.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. In Chapter 91, Fujiwara proposes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOfChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOfChicken">Game of Chicken</a> where everyone takes turns inflating a balloon and trying not to pop it. When the balloon gets close to bursting, everyone else is nervous except for Ishigami, whom the narration proclaims "a man who has abandoned all fear" thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> he got in the previous arc. ...And then he gets a good look at the balloon, realizes exactly how large and scary it is, and promptly chickens out as the narrator says "The Sports Festival Arc was meaningless".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a>:<ul><li> Chapter 74 as a whole to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic">Sh&#333;jo (Demographic)</a> romance stories.

She also uses it as a chance to get a rise out of Shirogane and force him to confess, but it fails because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had already decided to start being honest with his feelings for her in the previous chapter, which catches her completely off guard.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">Dub-Induced Plot Hole</a>:<ul><li> In the English translation, Kaguya refers to Shirogane by his last name instead of "President" and is on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with Fujiwara. Both of these lead plot holes in Volume 6, since Kaguya mentions in Chapter 52 that Kei was the first person she was ever on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with, and her inability to call Shirogane anything other that "president" in Chapter 60 set the entire re-election arc in motion. The official subs for the anime had the same issue when the first episode was released, but fan outcry resulted in them going back and changing it along with all future episodes. This is, additional to the fact that Japanese customs denote the level of formality in addressing a peer, the person's title being the most formal form of address, followed by the last name, while the least formal would be the first-name basis. Kaguya never addresses Shirogane by either his first or last name, as it would denote a level of fondness for him that she does not want to either admit or relent.</li><li> Another one occurs in Volume 9: When Otomo shows up at the sports festival to berate Ishigami, he ends up telling her off by responding "Shut up, stupid." This leads to a follow-up joke where one of Otomo's friends admits that she IS kind of an idiot, and Otomo herself reluctantly agrees on the basis that she failed the advancement exam to get into Shuchi'in's high school. The English translation changes Ishigami's retort to "Go to hell, jerk," but retains the follow-up jokes, making it sound like Otomo's friend agrees that she's a jerk, and that Otomo failed her exams because she's a jerk, effectively ruining the whole bit.

The tug-of-war between Kaguya and Fujiwara plays out differently depending on the medium.

Kaguya and Shirogane are both brilliant individuals who can expertly debate highly complicated and intricate subjects like philosophy without blinking an eye, and they are adored by their elite school as model students by both the faculty and the staff. Despite this, both of them are repeatedly mocked by the narration for their simplistic views of romantic relationships and their inability to confess to one another, which turns them from intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmasters</a> into bumbling idiots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a>:<ul><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX">Heh Heh, You Said "X"</a> chapter/episode focuses on the word "chinchin", which is a slang term for "penis" but is also the Japanese term for "beg" (as in, the dog-training trick).

The most prominent was when he outright asked her if she liked President Shirogane; Kaguya, unable to admit it, gave a flustered "No!" response which led to Ishigami announcing that he would tell Shirogane so he didn't have to stress about it. Kaguya panicked and grabbed him by the collar while shouting "Don't tell anyone!", which he interpreted as a death threat, kicking off the whole thing. Ironically, Ishigami was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> for the pair and probably would have helped them get together sooner if she'd just admitted her feelings honestly in the first place.</li><li> Iino and Ishigami don't get along because Iino in particular gets the wrong impression about Ishigami and is not aware that he really respects her and has looked after her ever since middle school.
