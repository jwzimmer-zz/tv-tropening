Also, when Miracle 3 defeated the Fujiyama Tiger Breaker he admits he almost failed, but in the anime he executes the same counter with ease.</li><li> Tiger Mask himself: in the manga his first battle with Miracle 3 was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion">Curb Stomp Cushion</a>, getting in full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> after the Fujiyama Tiger Breaker is countered, but in the anime he puts up a much better fight and even <em>wins</em>. Even if Miracle 3, now going as Tiger the Great, is stronger himself, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> as Tiger Mask's fights with the other challengers were more spaced in time, thus giving him time to keep up his training and not being tired from the series of fights, Tiger the Great countering the Fujiyama Tiger Breaker much faster leads to Tiger Mask not having his legs tired, and Tiger the Great ripping Tiger Mask's mask just making him <em>snap</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>: Tiger Mask has shades of this, as part of his motivations is a will to make up for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No Holds Barred Beatdowns</a> he inflicted, to the point he becomes physically unable to use fouls unless his foe uses them first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a>: Mr. Question/The Great Zuma is this, having the ability to understand how to use or defeat <em>any</em> move by seeing it once. He shows the copying ability by using the Cobra Twist after seeing it in use once, and then defeated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tiger Mask's first finisher</span> with embarrassing ease after seeing it once.<ul><li> Mr. Question's apprentice Snow Singh has a similar but lesser ability, being able to intercept flying attacks after the second time they're used on him, following with grabbing the unsuspecting victim and either sending him flying or applying a ferocious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetronomicManMashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetronomicManMashing">Metronomic Man Mashing</a>.</li><li> Also, Miracle 3, is described as this by Mr. X: according to his manager, Miracle 3 could have revealed Tiger Mask every strength and weakness of the challengers for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> Maskmen World Championship as he had seen them fighting. There's some truth in this claim, as before Tiger Mask finally accepts his challenge we see him observing Tiger Mask fighting to try and find a way to counter the Fujiyama Tiger Breaker, then he claims he can do so... And when they finally fight, he actually does it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>: Many wrestlers have declared they'll defeat Tiger Mask and/or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>. So far the only ones who succeeded are Mr. Question (who had promised <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he'd make the Ultra Tiger Drop useless</span>. Tiger Mask barely defeated him, but he still kept his promise) and Miracle 3 (who declared he'd <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">counter the Fujiyama Tiger Breaker</span> and defeat Tiger Mask, and was successful on both accounts).<ul><li> An unusual example comes from Mr. X: in the period Tiger Mask had to defend his NWA Maskmen World Championship from various challengers, Mr. X boasted not his own strength but Miracle 3's.</li><li> Again from Miracle 3: at one point in his first bout for the NWA Maskmen World Championship with Tiger Mask (reigning champion), Miracle 3 complimented Tiger Mask for his ability, worthy of the <em>former</em> Champion, speaking as if his victory was already decided. He then proceeded to defeat Tiger Mask.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCape">Badass Cape</a>: Tiger Mask wears a cape to the ring, but takes it off as he jumps in. In one occasion, the cape was even more badass by virtue of being filled with <em>dynamite sticks</em> (Tiger Mask expected to deal with gun-armed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, and when that happened the dynamite forced them to ditch the guns, grab the knives and get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">mauled in the space of two panels</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>: The ability to receive punishment of the wrestlers is above real life normal human levels. Pretty much every wrestler is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> since he can receive full force wrestling techniques (including falls from above) and survive.

Yet, Miracle 3 is one of the finest technicians of the series, in terms of strength he's inferior only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Gorilla Man</a> and a freaking <em>yeti</em>, and, as a Tiger's Cave pupil, he's very good at fouls. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">It's later discovered he's actually three wrestlers with a similar build; one is a very skilled technician, one is ludicrously strong and one is among the foulest Tiger's Cave pupils in history</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">The Brute</a>: A few heels are this, but Gorilla Man takes the cake in virtue of being the physically strongest wrestler in the entire series and the second of Tiger's Cave assassins (being sent out immediately after Black Python's defeat).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingTheDragon">Bullying the Dragon</a>: Happens late in the manga, when, during the Fake Tiger Mask arc, Tiger Mask is thought to have returned a heel: when he goes to America to find the imposter and prove he's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> fighting other wrestlers without fouls, American wrestlers attack him with fouls to get a first strike. Mr. K is initially lucky, as Tiger Mask doesn't reply in kind, but later he and another wrestler have a run-in with the imposter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">who shows them exactly</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">why</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">Tiger's Cave wrestlers are so feared</a>.<ul><li> El Sicodelico takes part to the Heel World Championship only to fight the foulest wrestlers in the world, provoke them into using fouls and learn them, using his technique to carry the day anyway. Then he fights Tiger Mask, and is initially winning without fouls, but as soon as he starts doing them Tiger Mask considers himself authorized to reply in kind, <em>laughs</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">makes short work of him</a>.</li><li> Two examples from the very first chapter: Tiger Mask is attacked <em>twice</em> by civilians after inflicting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> on another wrestler.

It was only after his victory against Star Apollon that he understood it, with both complimenting the other for the magnificent match.</li><li> El Sicodelico: after fighting Tiger Mask and suffering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">very fast defeat</a> as soon as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingTheDragon">started using fouls so that Tiger Mask would show him Tiger's Cave repertoire</a> he congratulates him for the victory, thanks him for leaving him the mask and gives him the motivation and the means to overcome Tiger's Cave conditioning for good.</li><li> Invoked mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a> by Miracle 3: during his first title match with Tiger Mask he complimented him and admitted he was worthy of being the <em>former</em> champion. He then proceeded to win the match and the title.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>: They have a brief but very important part in the series, as the orphanage owed money to <em>them</em>, and Naoto paid that debt with the money he owed to Tiger's Cave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>: It's stated early on that Tiger's Cave who fail in the attempt to defeat Tiger Mask will be killed by Tiger's Cave, but the only one actually confirmed is Red Death Mask (plus Rico and Rocky in the anime), while the others may have escaped and Gorilla Man is confirmed as living.<ul><li> Mr. X narrowly averts it thrice in the manga. The first time was after Red Death Mask's defeat: Mr. X begged to not be thrown on the execution ring where Red Death Mask had just been murdered, but the executives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">first berate him for daring to assume they'll give him the death of a wrestler</a> and then announce that, having done everything he could and succeeded in the secondary goal of making Tiger Mask resort to fouls, he'll be given another chance. The second time is after Miracle 3's defeat: this time the executives were ready to have him killed, but Mr. X returned with a kidnapped <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kenta</span> to bait Tiger Mask into going back at Tiger's Cave, and the executives decided to wait and see (when Tiger Mask actually showed up Mr. X was spared again). Finally, after Mr. X's last plan fails due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> storming Tiger's Cave with Tiger Mask, they decide to let him get killed by the beasts supposed to kill the attackers, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">Tiger's Cave trainees opened the gate so that the beasts would invade the main base</a>, saving his life (last we see him he's holding the executives at gunpoint as they run away in s helicopter)</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero-Approval Gambit</a>: Tiger Mask is quite fond of these. As a heel his gimmick was that of the foreigner who beat the crap of everyone and intentionally called for the fans' hate, so there would be more people watching his matches in the hope to see him defeated. As a face he did it three times he was expecting to die (first he abandoned the World Big League tournament and insulted Baba to try and win the Maskmen World League, then he beat the crap out of aspirant wrestler Teppei Oiwa to supposedly vent the frustration of having to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuProofMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuProofMook">Black V</a>, and then insulted the whole JWA roster before having to try and storm Tiger's Cave) so that his loved ones wouldn't suffer (plus Teppei Oiwa's beating doubled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>), but every time someone saw through it: when he quit the World Big League <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Baba</span> thought about it and realized that Tiger Mask wanted the first prize to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pay a surgery to heal a blind girl</span> and, with the identity of Great Zebra, helped taking down Egyptian Mummy and Lionman; Teppei immediately recognized it was a test of character and told so to Ruriko (who, for once, had actually fallen for it); when Tiger Mask insulted the JWA roster Baba, who remembered the past experiences, immediately called him on it, and when Tiger Mask insisted he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">followed him to Tiger's Cave with the rest of the roster</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">saving his life</a> and helping taking down Tiger's Cave</span>.</li></ul><hr>
