The only problem is that unlike his magic prodigy of a friend Yuno, Asta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer">possesses no mana</a>, and despite all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">physical training</a>, he cannot compensate for his lack of magical abilities.</p><p>This all changes during the ceremony in which everybody receives their own grimoire, which are used to focus and enhance the user's magic. While Asta receives nothing, Yuno receives a super-rare four-leaf clover grimoire, the same type used by the first Wizard King (most people receive three-leaf grimoires). Later, Yuno's attacked by a thief who's hoping to steal his grimoire, but Asta, in the process of protecting Yuno, receives a five-leaf, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">black clover</a> grimoire that contains an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">sword</a> inside.

She only began to show him affection when he beat a noble with magic, which began his pathological desire to win fights.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Many female Magic Knights are this. Noelle develops into this as she learns to control her immense magical power offensively, Vanessa is a capable fighter using simply magical threads, and Charlotte is the captain of a Magic Knights squad who transforms her sword into a rose bush to fight. Even Charmy has her moments, creating a giant sheep to pummel enemies. The greatest one in the Clover Kingdom is Mereoleona, who is stated to be the strongest Magic Knight and fights using hand-to-hand combat in combination with her brutal Flame Magic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>: In a scene where <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminOscar77/status/1128122380323307520">the Black Bulls are discussing new hairstyles for Finral<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Yami shows a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Super Saiyan</a> hairstyle while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">his English voice actor</a> briefly switches to Vegeta's voice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The anime fleshes out and adds certain details not found in the manga:<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a> in Episodes 55 and 56 fleshes out the introductions of Fanzell, Dominante and Mariella to better explain their sudden appearance at the start of the Forest of Witches Arc.</li><li> The fight between Yuno and Rill is <em>greatly</em> expanded, both in length and scale.</li><li> The anime spends two episodes showing how Yami and Vangeance first met, as well as how they became Magic Knight Captains.</li><li> The anime shows the six months of training in preparation for war against the Spade Kingdom which was not covered in the manga, which had an immediate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>:<ul><li> The Black Bulls are composed of people with names like Luck, Magna, Gauche, Charmy, and Grey. Then there are members with names like Vanessa and Gordon.</li><li> The Magic Knight captains qualify for this, with captains having names like Yami, Nozel, and Fuegoleon. Then there are captains named Charlotte, Dorothy, and William.</li><li> The name of the Wizard King is Julius Novachrono.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlchemicElementals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlchemicElementals">Alchemic Elementals</a>: Spirit Magic allows a mage to summon one of the four elemental spirits to aid in elemental magic and at higher levels allow the user to merge with them to allow for extremely powerful spells. So far, Yuno has Sylph, Fana and later Fuegoleon have Salamander, and Lolopechka has Undine, who has served the Princesses of the Heart Kingdom for many generations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>: The Witch Queen's attempts to have Asta kill off Vanessa's friends and make the latter awaken the potential of her thread magic to control destiny backfire on her. Vanessa's "Red Thread of Fate" magic succeeds in stopping Asta from killing her friends and since that particular magic can be formed only from the bonds between her and the Black Bulls, the Witch Queen gained nothing from trying to forcefully obtain Vanessa's magic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGenesAreCodominant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGenesAreCodominant">All Genes Are Codominant</a>: Magic attribute inheritance can act like this. Nozel, whose parents have Water and Steel Magic, has Mercury Magic, in contrast to his siblings who inherited a form of Water Magic from their father. Licht and Tetia's unborn son, whose parents have Sword and Wind Magic, can form a sword of wind through Yuno.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">All Love Is Unrequited</a>: Noelle, Rebecca and Mimosa all have a crush on Asta, while Charlotte and Vanessa both have a crush on Yami. In both cases, the guy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>. Charmy and Bell both have a crush on Yuno, who does not care. Asta has a crush on Sister Lily, who is a nun. Sol, a woman, has a crush on Charlotte, which seems to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Incompatible Orientation</a>. Ironically, the only major character to have a requited romance is Finral: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a> shtick hides the fact that he's in love with Finnes, who likes him too but is betrothed to his jerkass half-brother.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: There are some details about the characters that one reading only the chapters (and not even the character information shown between chapters in the volumes) would not get to see, such as a character's age or full name. This is done once again with the official guidebook, which lists more details about the characters, including minor characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>: The Clover Kingdom seems to suffer from this. On the one hand, the kingdom seems to resemble the medieval period in many ways, such as in architecture, mindsets and clothing of many of its people. And yet, at the same time, you also have outfits that could easily pass for modern day clothing, and certain kinds of clothes, such as swimsuits, are distinctly modern.

However, in the first chapter it's established that, despite his musculature, he still can't compare to skilled mages. Then, he manifests his grimoire, which gives him an anti-magic sword that he can wield because of his lack of magic <em>and</em> strength from years of training.</li><li> This is discussed regarding the kingdom's aristocracy. It's stated that the biggest factor to learn spells is natural talent. Nobility rarely train as a result and look down on it as something people who are not born into power do. However, it's also stated that dedicated training, battle experience, and intense determination in a crisis are important factors in manifesting power. This explains how the Black Bulls, who are mostly commoners who have been through many tough battles and trained hard, effectively face off against other, mostly noble Magic Knights in the Royal Knights Exam. And it's because Noelle has natural talent and worked hard as a Black Bull that she learns her spell Valkyrie Armor to save her siblings.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate">Hellgate</a>: The Dark Triad's goal is to create the Tree of Qliphoth, a magic channel that would connect the underworld to the living world, allowing devils to pour in.

That said, the kingdom is ruled by classist nobility who mistreat commoners, and many of the Magic Knights are corrupt, abusing their authority. Then there are the elves, a peaceful tribe massacred five centuries ago by humans who want to come back to life and get revenge. To accomplish this, the elves reincarnate into the bodies of, mostly, Magic Knights and try to kill every human in the kingdom.

Last but not least, mages rarely, if ever, focus on their actual physical aptitude, since they can fight long/medium-range in most cases and all their opponents will be mages anyway, Asta has a lot of actual physical strength, making him a warrior where there are only mages, making their defenses against magic useless against him and their lack of physical defense becomes a huge problem.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">Arcane Stages</a> as a whole are this to the Spade Kingdom.

It's also <em>weaponized</em>. Mages can gain new spells that fit with their important personality developments, sometimes in the heat of the moment. Gauche gains a spell that duplicates others when he resolves to become more selfless and cooperate with Asta. Noelle learns to cast Sea Dragon's Roar after overcoming her subconscious desire to not harm others when her friends are threatened by Vetto.

Thankfully, the Japanese volumes give the English translations of some of the troublesome names, so this is much less of a problem now. There's still the problem of names that must be directly translated, such as "Wizard King", which may be Sorcery Emperor and Magic Emperor, and "Eye of the Midnight Sun", which may be known as White Night Eye or White Night's Demon Eyes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualAntithesis">Spiritual Antithesis</a>: To <em>Naruto</em>.
