Although many of the stories featuring Golgo 13 revolve around the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper">assignment</a>, the sheer volume of installments have led to an increasing number of stories that mainly focus on his current clients or victims, with Golgo making only a token appearance (one story focused on the effect of just the threat of his presence, with Golgo never appearing in the actual story).</p><p>Several other stories have had him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke">making brushes with history</a>: Duke Togo spent time in prison with Nelson Mandela; he was partially responsible for Princess Diana's death while assassinating a fictional counterpart of Prince Dodi Al-Fayed; he knows what happened to Raoul Wallenberg; and he even shot the ballots that would have won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore">Al Gore</a> the 2000 U.S. Presidential elections. Needless to say not only has Golgo 13 been around but has been portrayed as being a major player in some major events.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>50 of the Manga stories were adapted for TV Tokyo: a Japanese television channel. The series ran from April 11, 2008 to March 27, 2009. The stories are almost entirely direct adaptations from the original stories with some modifications namely that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate">updated for modern times</a> and shortened to fit a near half-hour format.</p><p>Saito has mentioned in recent interviews that he has made draft plans on how to end it should it be necessary, either by him or by the editors. The Manga ended its run as the longest running manga without a single interruption in May 2020, at 52 years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Manga is still ongoing, but will miss a month or two due to the outbreak.</p><p></p><hr><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h2>This series contains examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">13 Is Unlucky</a>: Well, unlucky for his targets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects">2D Visuals, 3D Effects</a>: The TV series uses this for automobiles in motion, "Target 18" in particular is a good example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">Achievements in Ignorance</a>: An experienced yogi noted that Golgo achieved the first six stages of yoga without any consciousness of what they were via his own mental discipline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Golgo is a man of (oftentimes violent) action, not words, but when he has to talk to people who aren't trying to kill or cheat him, he's rather civil and well-spoken.<ul><li> According to the Viz release, he once "paid" a kid butterfly collector for helping him out with a rare butterfly. In the same volume, it's mentioned that he had donated to various good causes (probably as a cover for himself though).</li><li> He has teamed up with his clients to complete the job on separate occasions. The fact that he's willing enough to let them tag along (and most of the time, they aren't exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a>) if needed is actually pretty nice of him.</li><li> There have been times he accepted a lower-than-usual payment for a job from many a desperate client. (Keep in mind, his typical asking fee is $3,000,000.)</li><li> The weaponsmiths and contacts he employ are typically paid handsomely for their services. As a result, they are more than happy to provide tech support for him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: Dr. Belmeyer, with his impressive deductive talents and access to a highly advanced spy satellite, can see and understand nearly anything on Earth and makes actual comparisons between himself and God. He believes that if he can blackmail Golgo 13 into killing anyone he pleases, he'd be unstoppable. But can he see why Golgo shouldn't be treated like a pawn? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Not for long...</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmazonsWantHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmazonsWantHercules">All Amazons Want Hercules</a>: The female assassins being the Amazons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: The editor for Viz Signature's US release of Golgo 13 manga went absolutely apeshit with detail. The appendix of all 13 volumes contains everything you'd want to know about the man himself, right down to statistical analysis of his sex habits. His favorite soap? Brown Windsor. How does he like his steaks? Medium rare.<ul><li> It's also worth noting that Viz Media was only licensed to produce 13 volumes worth of stories as they chose not to take on the herculean task of translating the enormous number of stories into English. As a result they did their utmost to ensure readers know everything of relevance there was to know about Golgo 13 and you can pretty much consider yourself an expert on the Golgo 13 universe after reading all the appendixes in all 13 volumes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">All Women Are Lustful</a>: Stories typically tend to find women displaying this trope, especially where Golgo 13 is concerned. However, there have been some subversions of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Amnesiac Hero</a>: In "The Lost Assignment," Duke Togo has a loss of memory after a bomb explosion and is aided by the requisite beautiful female bystander. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">The Determinator</a>, even without knowing he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a> at first, Togo gathers enough information and fragments of memory to make it to the kill zone he's selected, but the question remains: who was he meant to kill among the people assembled in the kill zone? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Togo fires his gun in the air, and the hail of bullets from the bodyguards somehow restore his memories. Then he's faced with killing the woman who helped him, as he must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses">Leave No Witnesses</a>. A stray bullet however takes care of that problem.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAssassin">Animal Assassin</a>: One story involved the villain using a <em>giant aneater</em> to kill people by covering them in formic acid to attract it and having it suck all their blood out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Golgo 13; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Nominal Hero</a> below. Earlier versions of him, though, have shades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero">Unscrupulous Hero</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: A rare, cross-media example of this is the black hitman Spartacus who intially fought against Duke Togo in the story "The Brutes' Banquet" in the original manga. He later appears as a boss in the first NES game as well as in the TV series adaptation of "The Brutes' Banquet". This gives Spartacus the distinction of being one of the only Golgo 13 characters to appear in both the manga and the media stemming from it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a>: Golgo does outstanding investigative work and research for every hit he makes, and measures every little detail to make sure he strikes at the exact time. He studies his victim's habits, patterns, henchmen, and any other factor that might contribute or hinder the assassination attempt. Even more interesting is when he investigates rival assassins, whom he sometimes has to work against. He also has myriad contacts, like investigators, weaponsmiths, etc. to provide him with all the information and equipment needed for the job. If any fictional character can give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> a run for his money in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> department, it's Golgo 13.<ul><li> In the fifth episode of the anime, he goes against an outstanding Polish sniper, and studies his technique so intensely, he actually finds a strategy to beat him based on the fact that the sniper would compensate shots by moving the rifle <em>a third of an inch</em>. The video analyst that was viewing the video couldn't even tell the movement was made.</li><li> In the fourth episode, he startles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">a Mafia don's</a> bodyguard into drawing his gun so he could measure his draw speed. He then tricks the bodyguard into taking away Golgo's client, and when he's pulling her out of the car, he makes his move. Since the bodyguard was pulling the client out of the car with his dominant hand, he had a few microseconds of advantage at the draw.</li><li> And in the anime episode "Dead Angle", a young sniper called Katz uses this trope to work out what are supposedly the only two positions Golgo can snipe from. Duke however comes from one place the sniper insisted he wouldn't be, killing Katz as well as his target.</li><li> "Eye of God", included in the Viz release had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a> satellite photo analyst attempting to turn Duke into his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crook</a> with the help of a top-secret stealth spy satellite; he arranged for it to be overhead both when he met with Golgo and when Duke made the contracted hit. Because the first assassination date was overcast, the analyst rescheduled for the next window. After the new time came, the analyst looked at the photo of where Golgo was supposed to shoot from &mdash; and figured out that Duke was just standing there, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureWatchingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureWatchingMe">looking at the camera</a></em>. Just from the three times and places he was supposed to appear, Duke managed to figure out the orbit of the satellite. (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeGreeneSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeGreeneSpecial">Moe Greene Special</a> below for what happened next.)</li><li> A few other characters get some moments of ridiculous insight. In "Murderous Crosspoints", a man who trains in the same gym as Golgo &mdash; though he doesn't quite work out the latter is the world's greatest sniper &mdash; still figures he can be hired as a trigger man after noticing Golgo's regime is intended for arms that are expected to hold and fire guns regularly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit">Badass in a Nice Suit</a>: Golgo often dresses in a snazzy suit, and he's the most dangerous man on the planet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">Barbie Doll Anatomy</a>: Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girls Of The Week</a> in the series give us plenty of topless scenes, completely uncensored, but their downstairs stay Barbie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>:<ul><li> In Episode 42, Golgo is hired by the CIA to kill a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAgent">Double Agent</a> in a snowy area of Canada. He captures a henchwoman working for the agent, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndressingTheUnconscious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndressingTheUnconscious">leaves her stripped naked in a cabin</a> so that she can't escape without freezing to death.

Golgo, having learned that the couple had spent ten days in one of the greatest honeymoon destinations in the world, insists on monitoring the guy's wife, even as his clients receive information that the spy had been seen in another country. Sure enough, after a few days, the man sneaks into the city in order to see his supposedly fake wife once more, and Golgo snipes him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">Because You Were Nice to Me</a>: During the "Power to the People" arc, a flashback is shown wherein Golgo is told of a way to escape a South African prison by a younger Nelson Mandela.

He is the owner of a high class rehab center located on an island entirely encased in bulletproof glass and only reachable by boat or helicopter.

Golgo does this, but said rival calmly re-tunes his instrument and continues the performance with the remaining strings. Golgo's reaction? He leaves.

If the customer found out, he would weasel out of it by claiming that if the allegedly fine wine tasted the same as the lesser wine, it just meant that the customer didn't have the palate to tell the difference. Then one customer decided to test the vintner's trustworthiness by having his ostensibly first rate purchase be opened and tasted by world-renowned sommeliers in public. Knowing that this would result in his scam being exposed and the reputation of his winery being ruined for all time, the vintner hires Golgo to destroy the bottle before anyone can drink from it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>: Golgo is by all appearances, a darker version of James Bond.

It took the entirety of his savings up to that point, but since said spy had arranged for the president of the secret Swiss bank his funds were kept in to try and kill him, he certainly wasn't going to be keeping his money <em>there</em> anymore anyway.

And as with the spell, an error in the bargain you make with the demon means it will be able to turn on and destroy the caster&mdash;as the people who hire Golgo in that story learn after they warn the target, thinking the bodyguards or the East German police will take Golgo down after the assassination.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a>: Golgo 13 is noted for being both physically tough and also very intelligent, especially when it comes to calculations. A good example can be found in the story "The Masterpiece Assault Rifle". In it Golgo 13 engages in a sniper duel with two mercenaries using advanced rifles superior to his own M16, and modified with a unique electronic "super scope". Based on their firing patterns, he deduces that the scopes have a vulnerability in that they do not take shifts in gradient into account. He then calculates the gradient necessary for their shots to be totally inaccurate, and positions himself in an area of the battlefield with that gradient, easily blowing them away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetIntoJailFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetIntoJailFree">Get into Jail Free</a>: This happens notably in "Sleep Inside the Cage".

One of the most notable has been Nelson Mandela in "Power to the People". As mentioned, Golgo shared a cell with Mandela whom later hired him to help deal with ethnic supremacists who seek to undermine the status quo of his government.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke">Historical In-Joke</a>: The example in the previous trope above is a good showcasing of how Golgo 13 has played a fiction-based role in helping history unfold through his assignments.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">Hitman with a Heart</a>: Mostly averted. Once he accepts a job, he'll do it. He just usually doesn't accept "easy" jobs, but will kill anyone he does agree to kill, be it man, woman or child. The latter is just very, very rare. Besides, while some of his rivals tend to kill their targets in gruesome ways (like Snake in the Professional), Duke does get rid of his targets quick and easy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSituation">Hostage Situation</a>: Golgo has been contracted with helping to end hostage situations typically by eliminating hostage takers.

She then turns and looks directly at where Togo is looking through the sniper scope.

He has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment when Togo pauses while getting into a taxi to look directly at them, but his DOP assures him that at the distance they are filming, their camera will be too small to make out. Whether or not Togo did see them is unclear, but he picks up enough clues to work out what's going on anyway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>: While he has these in spades, Duke does not lean on them heavily, preferring more realistic shots. If he forgoes his modded M16 during a mission for a specialized long-range rifle, you know he's going to use them, though he is capable of doing fantastic feats with his M16. Examples include the following:<ul><li> In the story "Hollywood Cinderella", he kills another person while sighting through a <em>television!</em></li><li> The story "Sharp Shoot on the G String" has him contracted to sever <em>a single violin string</em> in the middle of a concert, without damaging either the violinist or the violin. He was able to do this because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">he spent hours watching a tape of that performer playing that same piece in a previous concert over and over again to find the exact moment that the violinist would be holding his instrument at an angle where such a shot would be theoretically possible</a>. This allowed him to work out the fraction of a second in which he could shoot a target less than a millimeter wide.</li><li> In the story "The Glass Fortress", he manages to ricochet a shot off of the small wave created by someone playing in a pool to score a headshot.. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>twice</em>.</span></li><li> "GT The Sniper" - Duke hits a target moving in a high speed train from several thousand yards away while riding in the backseat of a moving car.</li><li> "At Pin-Hole!" - Similar situation: Golgo's target is a plane-hijacker. The terrain is wide open, so the only way to not be seen setting up to snipe is to do so from at least a kilometer out, and since the hijacker has a bomb, the shot must be an instant one-hit kill so that he can't set the bomb off before expiring. The plane has had its wheels shot out, causing it to slant to the side, making a poor shooting angle for anyone trying to snipe. The tire shooting out was a last minute change to buy Golgo time to set up, which means that he was also preparing for a shot at a different angle from a different range until half an hour before he got into position. Add to the fact that the sun is in the eyes of anyone trying to shoot. Golgo <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with a highly-specialized target rifle, snipes the hijacker from 2000 meters away</span>.</li><li> "One Second Out of 36,000" - Golgo's target is in a high-security jail, protected by a revolving door. The door slides at just the right angle for a successful shot to be made, but only at one VERY particular time, and even then, it's open for one second. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Golgo decides to set up a position in a nearby tree and wait until that moment. He gets a muscle relaxant so his muscles won't be tense for that amount of time. And of course, he makes the shot.</span></li><li> The 1983 movie had him take a sniping position behind a building blocking his target's (supposedly) bulletproof penthouse suite. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By setting his M16 to semiauto, he looses off a burst that breaks through the windows of the building, which end up going through the penthouse's windows and nailing the target... just as he was making out with a hooker.</span></li><li> "Diamond vs. Diamond" - Golgo has a gunsmith make a special bullet that's made out of a diamond. He uses it to destroy a BIGGER diamond by shooting the center point of the latter.</li><li> Perhaps his personal best is the story "The Impossible Hit"/"Room 909", where he makes the "Impossible" and "Improbable" parts integral to the plot.<ul><li> To begin with, the cops manage to get all the evidence they needed to incriminate him: they found him in the only hotel room the shot could be taken from, they found the custom precision rifle he used in the dust chute, they found the shell casing from the high-powered bullet(which a patrolman picked up <em>when it was still warm</em>, perfectly matching it to the time of death), etc. For all purposes, he was caught.</li><li> Then... they did the math on the shot: he sniped from a distance of 500 meters away (that's <em>five football fields</em>), through a two-foot gap between buildings (less than the length of <em>an adult arm</em>), at sundown with the sun shining on the window so the glare would render it all but <em>opaque</em>, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the line of fire requiring the shot to be <em>off-center</em>. Oh, and he put that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyLittleHeadshots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyLittleHeadshots">Pretty Little Headshot</a> right between the target's <em>eyes.</em></li><li> Final assessment; the shot was <em>statistically impossible.</em> They had to let him go, because a trial would be a waste of time; despite the reams of evidence, no jury on Earth would believe a human being could make that shot. And he chose the room in advance solely to take advantage of this; in order to convict him, a jury would first have to be convinced that Improbable Aiming Skills of his caliber are even <em>possible</em>. The head inspector even comments "To prove that he's guilty, you'd have to prove there's a monster amongst us with the skills of a god."</li><li> Oh, and just in passing? The shell casing was found because he <em>screwed up!</em> The custom rifle was a bolt-action that wouldn't have automatically ejected the casing, and he could have just broken it down and strolled away. Except he heard a noise behind him just after he fired, so his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReflexiveResponse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReflexiveResponse">Reflexive Response</a> was to work the action to chamber a round as he spun around... to see that it had been just a freaking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatScare">cat</a></em> knocking over a flowerpot, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">his eyes actually widen for a moment</a> as he sees the casing fly right off the balcony and land right next to a damn <em>patrol cop.</em> He cooked up the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a> plan &mdash; staying in the room he fired from for a full day afterward &mdash; to cover for it.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">Improbable Weapon User</a>: Golgo doesn't rely on them, but he can use them when he needs to, like a gun designed for zero-recoil shooting in space or a special bullet-reflecting beltbuckle.<ul><li> Then the special "diamond bullet" in "Diamond vs. Diamond".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>: Many targets have bulletproof glass or something similar protecting them, though Golgo always finds a way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing">Intimate Healing</a>: Golgo often engages in sexual activity with women as a means of relieving tension and stress. He mainly does this before going after his targets so he is more effective in eliminating them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a>: Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, in this case. Golgo 13 never fails an assignment, or for that matter misses a shot. If he did, he'd lose his reputation as an assassin and there would be no series. Later chapters solve the problem by focusing more on the people who hire him and how their situations deteriorate to the point that they need to bring in a hitman. (Infamously, he doesn't appear in one story at all; the central character merely uses Golgo 13's reputation as a weapon.) The fact that the stories are standalone and bounce around time help in this regard. That said, his heavily scarred body shows that while he's almost unbeatable, he isn't personally invincible.<ul><li> For completeness sake, there have been several occasions of him missing, at least once by weapons sabotage creating a misfire, and one complete miss caused by his bodyguard who uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathy</a>. He did make up for the last one by eliminating his targets in a spectacular manner though. During the misfire incident though... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he outright quits the job so he can hunt down the person behind the misfire.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisiblePresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisiblePresident">Invisible President</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a>; because they have to sign off on the hiring, whenever the US government hires Golgo 13, the president in office at the time of the story's writing will make an appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrrevocableOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrrevocableOrder">Irrevocable Order</a>: Once hired, Golgo 13 <em>will</em> kill his target. He will not accept cancellations, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though at one point, he's been outwitted, and on the other, he quit for personal reasons.</span> If you hire him, you <em>damn well</em> better want the target dead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">I Surrender, Suckers</a>: Duke will go to great lengths to complete a job.

There have been a few instance where he has been dynamic and has been seen temporarily working with others, sometimes his clients, to achieve his objectives. He also has multiple contacts from around the globe who supply him with weapons and intel on his targets. The closest he has to a true partner/sidekick is recurring character Dave McCartney, a Scottish gunsmith who supplies Golgo with weapons on an infrequent basis.<ul><li> A good example can be found in the story "Shadow of Death" ("Deadly Shadow of the Setting Sun" in the anime) where Golgo 13 teams with another assassin hired by the Soviet government, AX-3. Both have been hired to destroy a syndicate hideout where poisons are being manufactured. In what could be also considered a anti-hero variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a> trope, Golgo 13 agrees to work with AX-3 to better destroy the hideout.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>:</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>: In "The Orbital Hit", the U.S. government has a network of these in orbit, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeaceThroughSuperiorFirepower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeaceThroughSuperiorFirepower">nuclear missiles</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeThrowingAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeThrowingAct">Knife-Throwing Act</a>: A hitman posing as a circus performer demonstrates his skill with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a> by throwing a knife into the bulls-eye of a dartboard, just past his girlfriend's head.

The target is a Death Row prisoner who is remarkably calm about his upcoming execution. For good reason; he's a corrupt ex-CIA agent who has enough blackmail material on the Agency that they're arranging for the state governor to grant him a last minute reprieve. The brother of one of his victims hires Golgo to kill the prisoner, even though he's behind the prison's security and a ring of protesters against the death penalty. Golgo accomplishes this by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">assassinating <em>the governor</em> in his mansion, just before he can grant clemency. The CIA agent in the room with the governor can't give the failsafe code on his behalf, and despite the prisoner's suddenly frantic pleas, the execution is carried out on time.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses">Leave No Witnesses</a>: Golgo practices this regularly. The only real exceptions are if he needs an assistant for the job or his client specifically requests to be there to see the target's end. Even then, don't try to acquire any incriminating evidence about the job if you want to live.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">A Lighter Shade of Black</a>: Stories often see this trope come into play as Golgo's often faced or assigned to eliminate people even worse than he is. Even despite being despicable himself, readers are nudged into siding with him given he is comparatively less horrible than they are.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>:<ul><li> The ending of "The Wrong Man", in comparison to most stories. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A Duke Togo lookalike (with the same last name, no less) is confused for the real thing, and doesn't seem to realize the error until he is knee-deep in an assassination job. It's an honest mistake, but Duke Togo's intolerance for impersonators puts an innocent man's fate to question until the story's climax. The man lives, though it is unclear if Duke was forgiving, or actually <em>using him to set up the hit</em>.</span></li><li> "The Cheerful Sniper" features very little violence, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and at the end, Golgo's rival in the story is the only character who ends up dead.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffhanger">Literal Cliffhanger</a>: In the live-action <em>Assignment Kowloon</em> Golgo eliminates his target thanks to this trope.

This shocks Golgo enough to give him temporary deafness for a few days.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>: The story "Wiseguy" deconstructs the romanticized aspects of this trope. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">Michael Corleone's</a> possible future in Congress is given a darker spin with the story's villain, a Congressman from a Mafia family, who's taken gang warfare to a higher level thanks to government connections. Moreover, plenty of Golgo's targets and clients are Mafiosi themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: The eponymous character's codename in Golgo 13 carries a definite meaning. That meaning is a source of mystery as there have been numerous theories made by characters as to what it means.<ul><li> However the most popular theory, both in stories and to readers, is that it's a call-out to Golgotha: the hill on which Christ was crucified. The 13 is linked to the thirteenth disciple, Judas. This theory definitely has merit considering the iconic series symbol of a skeleton wearing a crown of thorns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">In the first chapter</a>, it's mentioned as a nickname given to him by fellow inmates in a West German work camp as his prison number was 1214.

This required him to pass through a checkpoint. He arranges to get a pistol made entirely of plastic (the plastic firing pin was explicitly stated to only be strong enough to stand up to firing one shot, but Golgo only <em>needed</em> one shot), which he concealed in a balloon, and hid the bullet in his mouth, which caused the man with the metal detector wand to assume that it was giving a false positive off of some dental work.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMindIsATerribleThingToRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMindIsATerribleThingToRead">A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Read</a>:<ul><li> The psychic Anna is disgusted by men, as she can read their filthy thoughts.

The yogi finds the ability to control one's body and mind at to kill with nothing but pure intentions terrifying in a murderer, and is deeply unsettled after Golgo leaves.</li><li> A Scientist who monitored his brainwaves was also shocked when Golgo's mind goes from nothing to full throttle in an instant, asking if he's developed some sort of self-hypnosis, or possessed some alteration in his brain.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>: A chemically-based one.

Golgo 13 is a worldly, adult-oriented manga sometimes incorporating world news events, where people will actually be drawn with something approaching recognizable ethnicity, especially the many portrayals of real people (Even Nelson Mandela needs Golgo, sometimes!). However, Golgo's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MukokuSeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MukokuSeki">Mukoku Seki</a> good looks (along with his polyglot abilities) become one of his greatest assets for being undetected, and even the other characters are confused about what ethnicity he is.

Examples include:<ul><li> Detective Smith in <em>Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon</em> is a textbook example of this trope.</li><li> Detective Shire in "The Impossible Hit".</li><li> "Bannings The Hunter": An aging Interpol detective, who desperately wants Golgo brought in. He is forced to be in an illegal operation bound to fail. At the end Duke gets away, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but the whole operation is caught on tape. Duke then burns the tape.</span></li><li> The client and his girlfriend in "The Saint With The Stench of Death".</li><li> "Touch Down": An old-school Baltimore PD detective tries to find the one who killed a beloved quarterback while his colleagues try using a new supercomputer to reconstruct the crime scene. The killer is Golgo, of course. While Duke gets away (by shooting up the computer) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the detective does manage to avenge the target's death by killing the clients.</span></li><li> "Hit and Run": A former SFPD detective's girlfriend is run over by a crime boss. What does the man do? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He doesn't hire Golgo, surprisingly. Instead he spreads a rumor that Golgo is out to get the boss in question, then takes a pot shot at the boss' penthouse window after his moll, goons, and criminal associates leave him to his "fate". Come the next morning, he admits to the hit-and-run incident, desperate for police protection. As a bonus he also offers to reveal the names of his associates.</span></li><li> Leon Goldman, from "Afterglow" crosses paths with Golgo. The two have had a history with each other, and Leon, an FBI agent in the twilight of his career, tries to make Golgo leave. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sadly, Duke kills him at story's end.</span>]</li><li> The police in "Room No. 909" (particularly the Lieutenant) are all good people who do their jobs well <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but Golgo went out of his way to specifically set up a shot that anyone in their right mind would call impossible for a human being to perform, and with no eyewitnesses to corroborate their theory their attempt to arrest him would be pointless as no jury would convict him, if the case even went that far</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeMeOutAtTheBallgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeMeOutAtTheBallgame">Take Me Out At The Ballgame</a>: In "Touch Down", Golgo assassinates a quarterback while he's making a running play during a game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His client was the man behind the target in the depth chart.</span><ul><li> Subverted in "The Blood-Stained Stadium". The hit actually takes place at an empty stadium.</li><li> A variation happens in "The Law of The Pedigree": Golgo's target is not a person. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's a prize racehorse.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">A Taste of the Lash</a>: The story "Power to the People" sees Golgo tied up and forced to undergo a whipping by South African customs agents after discovering he's carrying a concealed submachine gun in his luggage. Oddly enough this is enough to make him laugh subtly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>: Duke is a master at this. The incident during "A Fierce Southern Current" notwithstanding, there was also one time in "The Serizawa Family Murders" when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was asked if he was a child implicated in the murders of a secret ninja family after WW2 ended. The detective, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneCase">who had essentially sacrificed his life seeking an answer to the case</a>, stakes everything to get an answer out of Duke; Golgo is hired to kill the detective with a very specific condition. At the scheduled time, the detective would be waving a cane from side to side: the contract said that Golgo would shoot while the cane leaned to the right if he was the kid, or while it was leaning to the left if he wasn't. Come midnight, the detective's visiting ex-partner, who the detective explained his plan to, hears a gunshot. When he finds his colleague's corpse with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyLittleHeadshots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyLittleHeadshots">Pretty Little Headshot</a>, he also finds a broken cane. With a quick bit of detective work, the partner realizes Golgo had shot while the cane was directly in front of the detective, not leaning in either direction. In other words, Golgo refused to give ANY answer.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVsPerformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVsPerformer">Technician vs. Performer</a>: Several assassins Golgo meets consider themselves artists, and some romanticize killing. Golgo, in comparison, just coldly executes his marks (and the other assassins).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a>: The aptly titled story "Telepath" has Golgo 13 faced off against this in the form of Alina Dovator: a KGB agent who, as a result of covert experiments by the Soviet Union, is telepathic. She's able to use her mind to manipulate, sense threats and even cause death. Her telepathy serves as a major plot point for the story. As stated previously, this trope is credited with Golgo 13 missing two shots intended for his target, who Alina was protecting at the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>: During the early years of the manga, ex-Nazis of various kinds were common targets. In the 80s, Golgo had to face off against the so-called "Fourth Reich" (a Nazi revival group, lead by, of all people, an aging Martin Bormann) on three separate occasions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns">Throw-Away Guns</a>: Golgo sometimes discards the weapons he uses for a job after it is done. Given that he charges seven figure fees for his services, he can afford to replace his guns whenever he wants to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a>:<ul><li> The 1969 story <em>The Yellow Rose</em>. Duke is hired to kill a playboy only known as The Yellow Rose, who's infamous for seducing rich, famous women who later turn up dead. A pornographic film featuring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>-expy leads him to a rug factory in Iran, where he discovers countless other films, where he also notices that all the men appearing in the films are different people and can't be the Yellow Rose. Finally, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The REAL Yellow Rose is a hermaphrodite living as a woman, who's the brains behind the operation. She sells the films for high prizes to her rich clients, and smuggles them around the world hidden in expensive persian rugs. Her motivation? She hates the world because of her condition and takes it out on rich, beautiful women. This revelation is even enough to make Golgo surprised.</span></li><li> In the 1987 story "Route 95", a former Nevada businessman turned motel owner is found murdered. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out the one responsible is one of his employees, who is actually a hitman sent by his old associates from the Mob. Then comes another hitman who, ostensibly is there for the businessman's funeral, is there to take out the said employee. He does, but then Golgo shows up and shoots the second hitman in the arm. The last twist is that Golgo was only hired to maim, not kill him. He then leaves the second hitman be.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a>: Goro Serizawa from "The Serizawa Family Murders", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who may or may not have become Golgo 13. In either case, Goro was the youngest son of a clan of assassins trained from birth to do the government's dirty work. In the aftermath of Japan's surrender to the United States at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Goro was forced to watch his mother be killed for failing an assignment &mdash; but since he was too young to be fully indoctrinated, he snaps, steals a gun, and kills the rest of his family except for his younger sister. Despite this, he never talks about anything to the police, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer">Old Retainer</a> trains him into a formidable sharpshooter who eventually goes into the family business on his own terms.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">&Uuml;bermensch</a>: Golgo has indeed been doing this throughout his career.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery">Underestimating Badassery</a>: While they're correct in assuming he's not invincible, Golgo's more treacherous clients operate under the belief that he's formidable enough to get the job done, but weak enough to assassinate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred">Villain Cred</a>: Golgo has spent his whole lifetime building his legend.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>: To an extent. Generally whomever he's trying to kill (and often his employer) is even worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleSilence">Visible Silence</a>: Possibly first introduced to the West by Golgo, and is quite fond of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a>: "A Fierce Southern Current" revolves around an arms merchant trying to start a war in the south Pacific, with the promise of the billions Golgo's earned over the years going to the winner. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Duke beats him by immediately donating the money from the accounts supposedly up for grabs to the United Nations' nature conservation efforts, making it clear to all parties that he is refusing to be a player, then putting a bullet in the arms merchant's head for good measure.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>: A modified M16. M16s are generic and easy to find, so he can drop it after a mission with no problem, whereas hauling around a giant, expensive sniper's rifle would make discreet escapes nearly impossible. Also, he is the lone wolf of lone wolves, so he lacks a spotter or permanent sidekick of any kind. No one is watching his back for him. Using an assault rifle like the M-16 gives him a weapon that is equally suited for self-defense if he is attacked during a mission.<ul><li> Moreover, considering there are thousands of M16s everywhere, if Duke does lose his gun, he can always get another one, as stated in the Viz release's commentaries. This even comes into play when he gets one on-site, according to the volume.</li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a> makes this less awesome than it once was. When Saito began the series, sniping with an M-16 made about as much sense as sniping with an Uzi (Assignment: Kowloon even has Duke's scope zip-tied to the carry handle). AR platform weapons are now common bases for sniper rifles, without losing their assault rifle functionality. However, the Viz release actually manages to explain the probable reasoning behind this in one volume.<ul><li> The series even makes note of this; Duke has upgraded to each new model of M16 a few years <em>after</em> it becomes commonplace - presumably because he's waiting for all the bugs to be worked out.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToThePain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToThePain">To the Pain</a>: Golgo's threatened to shoot people one body part at a time without killing them in order to get information. He's also done more than threaten.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthSerum">Truth Serum</a>: One story features Golgo using this in gaseous form.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaskOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaskOfDoom">White Mask of Doom</a>: The cult leader Gabriel in "The Saint with the Stench of Death" wears one. Underneath, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">he's horribly disfigured.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: Golgo has no compunction about killing women should it be required and especially when they are his targets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Unfortunately, yes he would. It's just extremely rare that he has to. While he normally wouldn't even bother to accept a contract on a child, if he discovers that his target is one... well, he is a professional after all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Upon reading some of the more obscure stories such as "The Republic of Hunger" and "Checkmate" it has been shown and proven that Golgo is fully capable of enforcing this trope.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: During "The Orbital Hit" the CIA gets a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Intrepid Reporter</a> out of the way by hiring a call girl to meet him in the name of his contact and tear her dress in front of him, crying out that he was trying to rape her. After the mission is resolved, the charges are dropped and the reporter's set free. As the CIA man who tells him about the hit points out, cooling his heels in the clink for a few days is easily one of the <em>least</em> horrible things they could've done to him, particularly as they've hired the girl again to pick him up from jail...</li></ul><hr>
