Jyugo broke his restraints and, after they became cellmates later on, introduced him to manga and anime in an attempt to get him interested in life again. Rock was abused and starved by the prison guards, and Jyugo broke out of his own cell just to bring him some bread. When Rock refused to eat the crappy prison food, Jyugo freed him and took him to a diner. Rock was actually on the verge of STARVING TO DEATH, and Jyugo not only saved him, but also helped him develop his big eater tendencies as a result. Uno's past and how he met Jyugo have yet to be elaborated on, but he has repeatedly stated that Jyugo saved him and gave him his freedom back. The few flashbacks seen show Uno emaciated, crying, and in a state of distress, before another flashback shows Jyugo smashing his chains and Uno nearly bursting into tears as he realizes that he's free.</span> While Jyugo doesn't seem to think he really did anything, the other three clearly believe otherwise. Following Jyugo getting beaten half-to-death by Hajime, Uno told Hajime that Jyugo may be stupid and unable to do anything other than bust out of jail, but he is definitely not worthless or a monster because he cares about people, and is able to understand them in a way that no one else can.</li><li> This is also more or less the reason Jyugo feels so close to his cellmates. Despite the fact that he is near incapable of caring for himself and constantly needs their help, they don't ditch him, and are more than willing to help him, even if they whine about it. Jyugo outright states that his world was miserable and gloomy before they came into his life and brightened it up. Even if he can't understand them, it makes him happy to just be near them. This comes through strongly after he's released from solitary confinement following the New Year's incident; he's terrified that they will hate him for lying to them and being a monster, but his friends couldn't care less, and are just happy that's he's okay. They accept him for who he is, even if he is unaware of who exactly that is.</li><li> In season two, it's revealed that Liang, Upa, and Qi all admire Samon Gokuu a great deal, and that they are unusually loyal to him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is because of how they were helped by him after they were arrested. When Upa was arrested back in China, his family, who had believed that he died as a child, suddenly got back in contact with him and began sending him letters and gifts. Turns out, Samon found out about his past after reading his file and decided to inform his family that he was alive without him knowing about it. Liang was severely messed up in the head after his stint in the mob, and he was no longer able to believe that people could be good, especially himself. After he was transferred to Nanba, Samon took him in and began training him, and Liang was eventually able to get over his depression and start trusting people again. He outright considers the man to be his mentor, and wants to get stronger so that he can be useful to Samon and repay him for helping him. Qi had decided to never make drugs again after discovering that the mob boss he worked for had used them to kill people, and was very suspicious of the intentions of everyone who took interest in his skills. Shortly after he was arrested and sent to Nanba, Samon secretly took him to visit a garden that was off-limits to the prisoners because he wanted to thank him after he was able to use information Qi supplied upon his arrest to help solve a cold case. He had no ulterior motives, and told Qi that he thought his pharmaceutical skills were cool because they could be used to help others. This allowed Qi to regain enough trust in himself to keep manufacturing drugs because of what Samon had said. He was surprised that someone actually admired his abilities, and by the fact that Samon was so nice and honest, after he had heard rumors from the other guards that the supervisor was a traitor.</span> Upa outright tells Nico that it was just a bunch of little things, and that Samon was unaware of how much they had appreciated his actions after the absolute hell they had been through, having made a difference for them, and helped them all recover to find a new purpose in their life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Don't insult Elf's boss, The Man with the Scar.</span></li><li> <em>Never</em> harm Jyugo in front of Uno, something <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hajime</span> learned the hard way.</li><li> Do not call Kiji a cross-dresser or drag queen unless you want your face bashed in. Also, you really don't want to insult or belittle any of the other guards while in his presence if you value your continued existence.</li><li> Samon really doesn't appreciate being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> reminded of or compared to his evil older brother, Enki, and he especially doesn't like it when people accuse him of being destined to become a monster like his brother.</span> He also doesn't like being called stupid or being seen as below Hajime.</li><li> If you are a handsome looking guy, Trois, Honey, Kiji, and (arguably) Uno will most likely be less than fond of you.</li><li> As made terrifyingly clear during the New Year's Tournament, bringing up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Man with the Scar to either Jyugo or Mushashi is a very good way to send them on a rampage. Although this becomes less of an issue after the New Year's Tournament. Thanks to getting thrown into solitary confinement for their rampage, they don't really have much choice to reveal how they were used in illegal experiments. After Hajime forces Jyugo to evaluate himself and what he wants, and Kenshirou listens to Mushashi and believes his story, the two inmates, while they do still want revenge on TMWTS, mellow out considerably, to the point that they are able to make peace with each other.</span></li><li> Don't call Hajime a bald gorilla.</li><li> Do not acknowledge The Warden's crush on Hajime or tease her about it unless you have a desire to be bludgeoned, as Mitsuru repeatedly experiences.</li><li> Don't brawl or otherwise attempt to cause trouble in the dining hall unless you want to incur the wrath of Chef Shiro.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a>: Rock is the strongest of the inmates.<ul><li> On the prison guard's side is Yamato, who's almost always seen working out, even on "Please wait a minute." transitions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle">Bishie Sparkle</a>: The manga was simply bright and colorful, with some sparkles here and there.

Most of the inmates are screwed up on some level because of their pasts, and the show eventually introduces topics such as human experimentation, what it means to be human, abuse of power, the dark side of the criminal justice system, the criminal underworld, revenge, and child abuse. A prime example of this is how the mood takes a dive for several episodes after Mushashi's introduction.<ul><li> Season Two quickly becomes this. While the humor may still be there, it's far more focused on the action aspect, revolves around the inmates trying to foil the plots of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Enki and his allies</span> after the group breaks out of their secret underground prison, and involves people actually trying to kill the main characters. It delves into the pasts of the Building 5 inmates and Samon Gokuu, as well as elaborating on the pasts of the Cell 13 inmates and their bond with each other. It also brings up more serious, philosophical topics, such as: the power of kindness, regaining the will to live, the limits of the human mind and body, the power of trust, loyalty, the dark aspect of humanity, and morality.</li><li> It is since revealed that Nanba is under no one country's authority, being run by the World Administration Authority, which is accountable to <em>no one</em>. And the WAA also controls all the world's other prisons, having been given that power due to a high crime rate around the world.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>, mixed in with a few cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a> for good measure:<ul><li> As we learn early on, Jyugo. He was born and grew up within the prison walls, and his father was considered Nanba Prison's biggest embarrassment for unrevealed reasons. His inescapable manacles <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> were placed on him by The Man with the Scar.</span> His backstory and those connected to it are part of the backbone for the greater plot of the series. It's later revealed that his past could possibly be even darker than initially shown because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he eventually realizes that large parts of his memories are missing, and that they were likely wiped out by The Man with the Scar experimenting on him more intensely than he initially recalled.</span></li><li> Rock was something of a juvenile delinquent and had trouble controlling his temper. From his flashbacks, it appears that he was from a rich family, and that he ran away after his father disowned him due to his behavior. He was arrested for brawling on the streets, and was sent to a run-down prison that neglected and abused its inmates. When he ran his mouth off to a guard, he was brutally beaten and thrown into solitary confinement, where the guards starved him. He eventually became so malnourished that he grew weak and fell ill. The only reason he didn't die was because Jyugo found him. After Rock refused to eat the disgusting prison food that Jyugo offered him, Jyugo freed him from his cell and took him to a diner outside of the prison. The reason he's such a food enthusiast is because of the starvation he was put through; he credits Jyugo with being the person who gave him his appreciation of good food.</li><li> Uno is also hinted at having one, although it has yet to be elaborated on. He's very loyal to Jyugo, and states that it's because Jyugo saved him and gave him his freedom back. So far, the few flashbacks shown of his past present him as emaciated, beaten up, and in tears, and he has also had a flashback of Jyugo breaking his chains and setting him free.</li><li> Nico was a homeless street kid who was experimented on, abused, and used by a gang of drug dealers. After he was sent to jail for being tricked into helping transport drugs without knowing about it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">some sadistic prison doctors used his sickly condition as an excuse to perform painful and invasive medical experiments on him. He spent most of his childhood and early teen years naked and strapped to a medical table in an empty white room, and eventually gave up all hope.</span> Jyugo stumbled upon him after breaking out of his cell and, disgusted by how the doctors treated Nico like he wasn't human, snapped his restraints and freed him. Later on, the two become cellmates and Jyugo introduces a severely depressed Nico to manga and anime. Nico credits him with giving him the will to live again.</li><li> Musashi seems to have it the worst. When he was little, he was diagnosed with spontaneous combustion. As he grew older, it got him labeled as a monster after he lost control over his powers and was shunned by everyone except his parents. He was eventually able to return to college, but was cast out by the teachers and students, who speculated that he was the person responsible for the mysterious arson attacks that had been happening in the area. One night, he came home from school to find his house set on fire by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elf,</span> with his parents inside. When the police tried to arrest him on suspicion for murdering his family, he lost it and unintentionally killed them, and had to run away after a mob of bystanders started screaming that he was a murderous monster. After being caught, he was bounced around to multiple prisons and, due to his uncontrollable fire powers, was horribly abused by the guards. After losing his parents,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Man with the Scar and Elf</span> were the only people who believed he was a good person, and promised him that they would be able to rid him of his powers if he let them perform medical experiments on him. After the experiments, Musashi learned that while he can control his flames, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Man with the Scar</span> increased the frequency and power of them instead. It's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they</span> had been spying on him since he got his powers, and killed his parents to send him to prison so they could experiment on him. When Musashi attempts to attack <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Man with the Scar, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">slashes Musashi's eye</a></span>. Later, after finding out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jyugo was also experimented on, and asking him about The Man with the Scar, Jyugo</span> slashes his other eye, totally blinding him. By the start of the anime, Musashi has lost all hope, and has resigned to the belief that he really is a monster and, since he's already damned, decides to hunt down <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Man with the Scar</span> and kill him. After the New Year's Tournament, he begins to mellow out once Kenshirou promises to look further into the experiments being performed on inmates by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Man with the Scar.</span></li><li> As revealed in season two, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Liang, Upa, and Qi</span> also have one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They were all blackmailed into working under Hachiman, a crooked mob boss who brutally tortured Liang for being unwilling to kill his assigned targets, kidnapped Upa when he was a child and sold some of his vital organs on the black market due to being talented in chi manipuation,</span> and attempted to trick Qi into creating a drug that would poison his clients. They're all later arrested and sent to Nanba prison, but in the middle of the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hachiman, an ally of Enki, comes back to challenge them.</span><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out that Liang and Upa also had a run-in with Enki in the past. He was unfortunately assigned to them as a supervisor when they were in prison back in China, where he brutally abused them and the other prisoners in their cell block. It was so horrible that Upa thought he was going to die, even hoping that he would, as he wanted the abuse to end. They were relieved when Enki was transferred to Nanba, only to find out that they were going to be transferred to Nanba as well, and be assigned to his building. Fortunately for them, Enki had been exposed as a monster and locked away underground by the time they got there.</span></li><li> In season two, Samon is revealed to have one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His older brother, Enki, was a prison guard who was respected by guards and prisoners alike, due to his strength and talent. On the other hand, many people, including Enki himself, thought that Samon was weak and cowardly, insisting that the only reason he was able to become a guard in the first place was because of his brother's reputation. Unfortunately, what they didn't know was that Enki was more than just a jerk</span>;<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in reality, the man was a sadist, and tortured the prisoners under his care for his own amusement. Unfortunately, once he was transferred to Nanba, Enki didn't stop his cruelty, and was eventually exposed when he murdered an inmate for fun and killed/injured multiple guards when they tried to arrest him.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When the other supervisors finally cornered Enki, Samon was able to close in, and was told by the other guards to finish him off, but hesitated because he was unable to bring himself to kill someone, much less his own brother.</span> Hajime stepped in and quickly defeated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Enki</span> without killing him, resulting in Hajime getting praised by their colleagues, as well as promoted. This entire incident lead to Samon's hatred of Hajime. Samon is eventually promoted as well, and takes over his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brother's</span> job as the supervisor of Building 5. In the present, years after the incident, he's still taunted by some of the other guards, who think that he was only promoted out of need instead of earning his position on his own merits, and many of them also fear that he'll end up being as evil as his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brother.</span> The main plot of season two <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> revolves around Enki's escape and takeover of Building 5, along with two other prisoners and Inori</span>, causing Samon's past to come back to haunt him. When confronted again by his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brother</span>, Samon is quickly defeated because of his continued reluctance to kill anyone. Not only that, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the sole reason Inori betrayed Nanba is because he utterly despises Samon for being promoted instead of him, and wants to see him dead for no other reason than the fact that he thinks Samon is weak and a waste of space.</span> Despite acting like a total ass, Samon is a good person at heart, and doesn't want to hurt anyone; he isn't anything like his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brother</span> at all, and doesn't deserve all the hate and suspicion he has received over the years.</li><li> Tsukumo was the first inmate revealed to have one. He was born into a shinobi clan, but due to how poor his skills were, he was abandoned in the woods as a child and forbidden to come home until he became a proper ninja. One day, a woman claiming to be his mother showed up and took him in. Poor Tsukumo was so lonely and desperate for a family that he didn't realize the woman wasn't his mother at all; she was a movie producer with a failing career, who stumbled upon him while trying to find a real shinobi to act in the film that could save her career. She took him in and groomed him to be a famous shinobi actor, but he was unaware of the fact that he was just being coached to play a role, as he thought that his acting lessons were training, and that being an actor was a normal thing for a ninja to use his skills for. Eventually, he found out the truth after his manager (who also happened to be his adoptive brother) and his mother's assistant accidentally let the truth slip, as they thought he already knew. He took off back to the woods to try and find his village and reunite with his birth family, but he got lost and ended up being arrested for trespassing. The reason he continues to act like a ninja, despite not being a good one, is because he honestly has no other clue how to act; he spent so long changing his personality and character to please others that he now has no real personality of his own. When Jyugo tells him he should just be himself and act natural, Tsukumo actually tells him that he has no clue who he even is. If that wasn't sad enough, his brother/manager visits him after he's transferred to Nanba and tries to convince him to continue acting, totally disregarding their mother's lies and the misery that they put Tsukumo through. Currently, all the guy wants is to finish paying his debt to society and find somewhere quiet to live out the rest of his days in peace, away from the film industry and his adoptive family.</li><li> Despite being a comedy show, pretty much every inmate introduced so far, barring Trois and Honey, has some sort of messed up back story, ranging from sad, all the way to downright horrific.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>: Poor Hajime thinks that The Warden wants to kill him instead of wanting to kiss him every time she looks at him.<ul><li> Hajime is no slouch either; he's capable of making some horrifying faces to scare the Cell 13 inmates into obeying him.</li><li> Hell, most of the guards and inmates are great at making terrifying faces at each other when they're pissed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">Deliberately Monochrome</a>: In Tsukumo's flashback, his adopted mother and her assistant were the only characters that were in greyscale, even when they moved out of her office.<ul><li> After Jyugo activates his swords and gets sent to solitary confinement, he's colored in greyscale until he finds purpose in himself.</li><li> In season two, after yelling at someone for yanking on his braid, only to discover that it's one of the scythe-wielding security dolls, all the color slowly drains out of a terrified Uno and his surroundings.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>: In Season 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rock, Yamato, and Seitarou are all confined to the infirmary for the second season while the rest of Cell 13 play an active role in the plot.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedByTheMotive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedByTheMotive">Disappointed by the Motive</a>: The Warden and Samon Gokuu are appalled when they learn about Cell 13's reasons for escaping the previous prisons they had been incarcerated in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>: The dynamics in Cell 13 are more than a bit similar to a family.

It's never been brought up in the series proper, but even as a child in flashbacks, he never wore shoes. The only time he has actually been seen wearing some is in a multi-chapter, manga-only side story set in the past. When he and Uno busted out of prison in Nevada, he wore straw sandals as part of his street clothes. They inexplicably disappear in the next special chapter.</li><li> Mushashi as well. He at least wears what looks like straps wrapped around his feet, but they aren't technically shoes.

Nico's dislike of needles stems from all the experiments done on him in various prison hospitals.

The reason he dislikes Seitarou and constantly yells at him is because he's jealous that the young man was voted the most handsome guard in Nanba over him. He also has zero tolerance for the inmates in his care not maintaining their appearance.</li><li> Trois and Honey, following the rumored stereotypes of the inmates of Kiji's building, are rather vain and spend a lot of time arguing with each other about who's more attractive.</li><li> Kenshirou is jealous of Hajime being the object of The Warden's affections, whom he has an unrequited crush on.</li><li> This is more or less the reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inori</span> ends up betraying the guards by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> plotting with Enki Gokuu and helping set the events of season two in motion.</span> He strongly detested <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Samon Gokuu</span>, who he viewed as weak and cowardly, and only thought that he was able to become a correctional officer because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his brother Enki's good reputation.</span> The tipping point came when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Samon was appointed as Enki's replacement after his older brother was imprisoned for murder; Inori already hated him for no good reason, and the last straw was the younger, less experienced Samon not only getting promoted instead of him, but becoming his supervisor.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody">Grievous Harm with a Body</a>: Due to being physically tougher than his brother, Hajime is able to use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hitoshi</span> as a bludgeon without worry of hurting him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elf</span> is easily the most hated character by fans, and it's not hard to see why. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not only did he help experiment on Musashi and Jyugo, but it's later revealed that he was the one who framed Musashi for murdering his parents in a house fire.

In season two, it's revealed that he's actually rather kind, and cares a lot about the well-being of his inmates. He's also distrusted and feared by the other guards and supervisors due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being the younger brother of Nanba's infamous traitorous guard, Enki.</span></li><li> While Qi may compulsively manufacture weird drugs and poisons, he's strongly against making drugs that will kill or cause permanent damage. Also, as shown in flashbacks when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was forced to work for the mob, and witnessed a young Liang and Upa being forced into doing things that horrified them, only to be tortured by their boss when they refused to follow his orders</span>, he does not like people who think it's okay to hurt children.

Upa acts cold and claims to hate most people, but is actually fond of his cellmates and their supervisor, Samon Gokuu. While he's initially annoyed by Nico and constantly yells at him, he secretly considers him to be one of his first friends, and is concerned about his well-being due to his medical condition.</li><li> In the first season, Trois and Honey are little more than a pair of egotistical pretty boys. In season two, they get their moment to shine when they go up against Ruka Gojou. Trois is a mechanical genius who can whip together flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and bombs from random objects in mere minutes, and Honey is an expert at laying traps using homemade bullets rigged with monofilament wire. While the two may constantly argue with each other, they're actually a formidable team. They escaped previous prisons this way before being sent to Nanba, with an escape record that rivals Cell 13's.</li><li> In the manga, Mushashi tells Kenshirou that he can read and speak forty different languages, despite being blind. He was going to college to become a translator before his arrest, and since he also learned braille, he's still able to read even though he can't see. He's also very intelligent, as it's mentioned that when his condition didn't prevent him from going to school, he always got straight A's. The only exception is that he appears to not be able to write in other languages; in a manga-exclusive strip showing him and Kenshirou at the New Year's Tournament, Kenshirou did most of the work until the final match, as Mushashi didn't know how to write in Japanese, and couldn't play cards because of his blindness.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAlwaysWantedToSayThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAlwaysWantedToSayThat">I Always Wanted to Say That</a>: The New Year's Tournament reveals that Nico has a whole <em>list</em> of heroic quotes he's got stashed away for when he gets into certain situations.

The guy is often still an ass, though.</li><li> Uno may be a jerk at times, but he does care deeply for his cellmates, particularly Jyugo. Thanks to Jyugo's lack of skills at...well...pretty much everything, Uno spends a lot of time taking care of him and helping him during their escapes. He cares about his friend so much that, when he was about to be stabbed to death by Ruka Gojou, his main concern was that Jyugo would be killed for sure if he wasn't there to protect him.</li><li> Upa may have zero tolerance for the foolish behavior of the other inmates, but he does care about Nico and considers him his friend. Despite how he yells at him and lectures him about his childish behavior, he's concerned about Nico's medical condition; when they're confronted by Hachiman in Season 2, he actually buries Nico in rubble in an attempt to stop him from getting involved and overexerting himself. He's also close to Liang and Qi, despite how annoyed he can get with his cellmates, and admires Samon Goku more than he lets on.</li><li> Qi may be lazy and focused on self-preservation, but he does care about people, especially ones who are young or sick, more than he lets on. In the past, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> had his own internal organs removed and transplanted to a dying Upa, something which Upa has been unaware of until Qi tells him about it in season 2.</span> He also has a bit of a soft spot for Nico, and goes through hell to get him his medication after they're stranded in the underground without it.</li><li> The Otogi's may be a pair of elderly jerks who'll attempt to blow each other up with military grade weapons and/or demand a divorce for extremely petty reasons, such as the eggs being cooked wrong, but not remembering who actually made breakfast that morning, but they genuinely love their "daughter" Kaguya and always end their fights for her sake, albeit reluctantly, and try not to start them in her presence. They both also have a bit of a soft spot for Nico. Okina may be rude to him, but it's more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">concern</a> due to how risky Nico's careless behavior can be to his health. In addition to making the arcade room for his tournament prize, Kazari also created an advanced hand-held game system just for him, despite not needing to, and had to hide a smile after seeing how enthused he was by her work.</li><li> Kenshirou hates Hajime and is usually very cold, but he's also the calmest of all the guards and the least likely to lose his temper, as well as the one most likely to resolve problems in a nonviolent manner. He also cares deeply for Mushashi and believes that he is a good person. When he confronted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Enki Goku</span> because he believed that the former wasn't evil and wanted to hear his side of the story, it takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the former guard coldly stating his intent to murder Mushashi for possesing his unnatural powers to piss Kenshirou off enough to fight him.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a>: You certainly get the vibe of this from Hajime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Knight of Cerebus</a>: While signs of a darker plot were shown in Episode 1 through Jyugo's unbreakable shackles, the mood of the series takes a bit of a nosedive (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">prison escapes do too</a>) after Musashi enters the picture.<ul><li> In Season 2, all the humor in a scene instantly dies down whenever <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enki Gokuu and Ruka Gojou</span> are involved in any way.

It's later revealed that they tend to do this multiple times a day just for fun, and that they're not interested in actually escaping the prison. Jyugo in particular is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>, in the fact that it's the <em>only</em> thing that interests him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>: Chef Shiro.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidHairGrowth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidHairGrowth">Rapid Hair Growth</a>:<ul><li> Nico causes the guard dogs to spontaneously turn into barking balls of fluff when he comes into contact with them, a side-effect of the tranquilizer darts he was shot with.</li><li> In a manga-only side-story, Nico caches actual 'rapid hair growth disease'.

They manage to defeat the building 5 guards, Kokoriki and Youriki, and un-brainwash them, but the two have no memory of what happened, and they not only don't believe the inmates' story, they think that they were attempting to break out of prison and try to restrain them. Honey, Trois, and Uno end up having to fight them off <em>again</em> as they search for Kiji, and state that if Kiji doesn't believe them, then they're all screwed, because using Trois and Honey's traps on the guards counts as assaulting an officer, and could get them all hard punishment.</li><li> After the inmates manage to free Kiji, they get lectured INTENSELY, to the point that Uno and Honey are in tears; they may have saved Kiji and he may be pissed at Kokoriki and Youriki for not believing them or trying to free him, but they're still wandering around unauthorized in a cell block that isn't theirs, in a forbidden part of the prison, so rescuing him is worth jack as far as he's concerned. Even though Enki is still loose and some of the guards and inmates are missing, his priority is to handcuff the inmates and take them back to their own cells. In the inmates' defense, Trois and Honey broke out to look for Kiji after he didn't come back from building 5, and the Cell 13 boys came to the building WITH Hajime; it's not actually their fault, as it's not like they were looking to get captured and nearly killed. This goes doubly for Liang and Upa, who actually ARE in their building; they didn't do a single thing wrong. One of their guards, Inori, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turned out to be a mole working for Enki</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and he brutalized and restrained them before showing their unconscious bodies to Samon Gokuu, taunting the supervisor about it before locking them all up. Of everyone involved, the only one who did anything that could be considered wrong was Qi, who temporarily joined up with Hachiman, but he actually had a good reason for that; everyone else was just trying to defend themselves.</span> Even still, you can see Kiji's point; not just one high-security inmate escaped, but THREE, including the biggest threat, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Enki Gokuu</span>; three supervisors were captured, multiple people were brainwashed to attack everyone else, it turns out that some of Enki's old handcuffs and other inventions weren't destroyed after his arrest like they were supposed to be, the security system is all screwed up, and<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inori is the traitor who screwed up the security system</span>, not to mention that all this happened mere hours after the warden left to attend a meeting. All that's bad enough, so they don't need it getting out that eight inmates, five of whom shouldn't even be in the building in the first place, were also wandering free in a restricted area at the same time. And it was mentioned at the beginning of the season that Nanba has already been toeing the line under intense scrutiny ever since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Enki's betrayal</span></li><li> Although Jyugo wants to release Samon from his cell because he believes it's the right thing to do, Hajime has a moral crisis over what to do, because the situation is practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Catch 22</a>. If he lets Jyugo free Samon, then he'll know Jyugo can escape imprisonment at will, and the other supervisor will probably report them because he's been digging for dirt on Hajime to file a report on. If they leave him, however, Hajime will get in trouble for leaving a fellow correctional officer behind, and it'll also raise the question of how only Hajime managed to get out. He also hates Samon, and wants to see him continue to suffer the indignity of being in a cage. He eventually decided to let Jyugo set Samon free, as he concludes that all outcomes look bad, but freeing the other guard will raise the least amount of questions, and will probably work in his favor if he gets reported.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">Red Oni, Blue Oni</a>: In Cell 13, Nico and Rock tend to be more fun-loving and impulsive (red), while Uno and Jyugo are smarter and more observant (blue).
