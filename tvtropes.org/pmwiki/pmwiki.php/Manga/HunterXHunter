It returned in 2010 <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em> Double Issue #5-6, and ran for 20 chapters. It then went back into a year long hiatus since 2010 <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em> Issue #26, but has finally returned again in 2011 <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em> Issue #35-36, for 30 chapters then it went on a break again on Issue #16, 2012. It <em>seemed</em> to have settled into a system where we get one <em>tankobon</em> (single volume collecting ~10 chapters) every 6 months, instead of every 2 months; this puts <em>Hunter</em> on par with mangas that get a new chapter each month, instead of each week. Its last run was on June 2017, although it returned in January 2018 and again in March of the same year before eventually going back into hibernation for most of the year until returning in September.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The series has two anime adaptations, one that premiered in 1999 and lasting through the Yorknew City arc in 2001, with OVAs later covering the Greed Island section before having to stop since the anime had caught up by that point in 2004. Eight years later, it was given another adaptation in 2011 and covers near all the series up till the Election arc in 2014 since the manga's hiatus meant the Dark Continent arc was on and off.</p><p>In 2008, the original anime was licensed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a>, but had various alterations to the DVD release, without informing the fanbase, causing sales to tank.</p><p><em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em>'s double issue #35-36 in 2011 ultimately confirmed that the series would get a complete anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake">remake</a>, disregarding the previous animated series and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OVAs</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponAnimation">Nippon Animation</a> to start from the very beginning of the story; it was animated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse">Madhouse</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioLive">Studio Live</a> and directed by Koujina Hiroshi, the character designs handled by Yoshimatsu Takahiro.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">Two movies</a> for the series were also released.

Eventually it's revealed that this whole conflict, punishment included, was a fairly mundane argument between family members that only looked scary because everyone involved is a world-class assassin (c.f. the morbid inclinations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">the Addams family</a>).

It seems impressive at first, until it's revealed that that Nen style is the exact opposite of his innate ability, and is complicated enough that he <em>can't learn anything else</em>, making him a one-trick pony that's easily thwarted once the ability's weakness is found.<ul><li> Kurapika's Nen ability manifests as chains on his hand that has a unique power for each finger, which let him fight and kill the monstrously powerful Phantom Troupe members. He also has an ability called Emperor Time that breaks the rules of Nen by allowing him to use any Nen category at 100% efficiency. Unfortunately there are some steep drawbacks to these abilities. Emperor Time takes a large toll on Kurapika that gets worse the longer it's active. As for the chains, one can only be used on Phantom Troupe members or Kurapika will die, two can only be used during Emperor Time, and the other two don't have drawbacks but are strictly support abilities.</li><li> The <em>En</em> technique qualifies. It allows the user to extend their Nen in order to sense everything within a certain radius, making it useful for tracking and detection. The drawback is that getting any mileage out of it is nearly impossible because it takes up more Nen the larger you make it and unlike most sensory techniques can be picked up on by others who are proficient in Nen usage because of how focused it is.</li><li> Welfin's Nen ability consists of him triggering four missiles mounted on a band around his waist. Though it's fearsome looking, Welfin has to ask three questions for the missiles to actually shoot and seek their target. If the questions do not satisfy Welfin's conditions, the missiles would be shot and explode, but it doesn't work if Welfin is not able to ask the questions or if the target moves from the location in which Welfin estimates they are, meaning that they won't work blindly. As such, the ability is mostly for show.</li><li> Cheetu has this very tendency with everything he comes up with, which is shown when he traps Morel in a conditioned Nen room that requires Morel to catch Cheetu to be able to escape. Morel quickly realizes that the Nen conditions for the imprisonment made by Cheetu have huge logical gaps, meaning he doesn't actually have to pursue Cheetu to catch him or that Cheetu cannot actually attack him if he doesn't want him to leave, so he sits the whole way through, playing with Cheetu's impatience. Eventually, Morel is able to trick Cheetu by using his smoke.<ul><li> Cheetu spontaneously creates an ability while keeping Morel imprisoned which consists of a crossbow on his right arm. Though Morel is impressed at his coming with a weapon on the spot, he wonders why Cheetu would need a weapon that&#146;s slower than Cheetu&#146;s innate abilities. Frustrated with this quandary, Cheetu lets Morel leave.</li></ul></li><li> It's basically the concept of "Contract" in Nen. One can increase their overall power by putting restriction to their Nen or ability use (e.g. "I will only use this skill on Tuesdays"). The user's ability to abide by their own rules in using those skills affect the effectiveness of the mentioned skills, and breaking their own imposed rules may result in them losing their Nen. But they can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">take a step further</a> by setting "limitations" with higher stakes, such as risking their lives, as Kurapica did for his Chain Jail ability, which he swore he'll only use against the Phantom Troupe.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">Aw, Look!

It's easy enough to peg him as <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a>, but that doesn't really do him justice. Neither the readers nor the other characters can really predict where his moral sense will take him, and he surprises even his best friend (a child assassin) a lot. A serial killer once trained him and Killua, and he cheerfully allowed the person to go free afterward even after it was pointed out that this would cause more young women to get eaten, because "he helped us" (though said serial killer later turned himself in out of appreciation for Gon). After one of the Phantom Troupe is killed by Kurapika, Gon and Killua are captured by his best friend, who suspects them of involvement and rants, in tears, about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">how much it hurts</a> to have lost his blowing-stuff-all-to-hell partner. And <em>Gon responds with sudden fury,</em> because he had assumed that the Troupe's members could do such horrible things because they didn't understand how much it hurt to lose people, which meant he couldn't hold it against them, but if they <em>can</em> and still do it they're so incomprehensibly evil he wants to <strong>end</strong> them. Tonpa admits how much he enjoys watching people fail miserably and die taking the hunter exams, which infuriates everyone else... except Gon, who continues treating him like a friend because he inadvertently helped them with his cowardice. Hanzo broke his arm during the hunter exam and when he threatened Gon's life, Gon simply said that "they would have to settle things in a different way" because if he died then Hanzo would lose (Gon not at all realizing the implication of the threat or simply didn't care about dying at all). He uses Komugi, a blind, innocent girl who&#146;s been mortally injured, as a hostage to ensure Neferpitou doesn't try to escape before bringing Kite back, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">threatens to kill her</a> if s/he does. To sum it up Gon has a simple world view, lives in the moment and judges people by their personalities and his experiences with them.</li><li> The Chimera Ants enter this territory from time to time, as well. Although most of the ants are evil and some are good, the king, Meruem, is a master of this trope. All the experiences he goes through continually shape his moral code which fluctuates wildly through the arc, turning him from what appears to be a Cell ripoff into one of the most deep and interesting villains in Shonen manga. And yet he always seems to have his code stuck somewhere in the Blue and Orange territory, possibly due to the mental divide he faces between his ant personality and human nature.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>: People on the receiving end of Illumi's pins, the people on the receiving end of Neferpito's ability. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gon after the Chimera Ant battle. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangareader.net/hunter-x-hunter/333/10">Even Killua's terrified and he was a career assassin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyUploading">Body Uploading</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>, with Greed Island, allegedly the world's hardest-to-obtain video game.

It is so compact or at least can be built compact enough to be implanted into people: Netero had a Poor Man's Rose with a fail-deadly trigger implanted into his body before going to battle against the ants. When he fought against Meruem the Ant king and saw that he wouldn't be strong enough to defeat him, he killed himself by stopping his heart, triggered the explosion, and mortally wounded the king.

Knov, for instance, who was specifically picked up for the highest-threat and highest-difficulty level mission against Chimera Ants, became almost completely demoralised after seeing just the brink of Neferpitou&#146;s aura at close range and soon after lost almost all hair on his head.

As Wing exposes to Zushi, Gon and Killua have innate abilities beyond Zushi's, who is already gifted himself to a lesser extent.

Being willing to reveal your Nen to another is either a gesture of complete trust or a sign of your confidence in your ability to use your Nen, despite your opponent knowing how it works (e.g. when Hisoka explains his Bungee Gum to Gon).

As Machi is 159cm and Shizuku is 160cm, making them one and two centimeters taller than Killua and five and six centimeters taller than Gon; seen in the Yorknew City Arc, the two girls are a full head taller than both boys despite being roughly the same height as Killua, albeit a bit taller. <a class="urllink" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0SFWJlt_Z8s/ULsJ252PYAI/AAAAAAACOD8/Pl6a8ptNT_E/s1600/%255BHorribleSubs%255D%2BHunter%2BX%2BHunter%2B-%2B57%2B%255B720p%255D.mkv_snapshot_00.23_%255B2012.12.02_15.01.23%255D.jpg">See for yourself.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">No Celebrities Were Harmed</a>: There's an obvious one of Kim Jong-il; his name is even an anagram for Kim Jong-il.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>: The main underlying theme of the late Chimera Ant arc is that the supposedly heroic humans and the supposedly monstrous Chimera Ants are mirror images of each other, or rather, "two sides of the same coin".

However, at least in the remake anime, everyone from the 200th floor and up of the Celestial Arena are Nen users, with showy Nen battles, open to a very large betting public and ALSO probably televised around the world. The commentator of the fights even talks about the use of Nen from the fighters in the arena. The only possible way for Nen to be the secret it was supposed to is if the Celestial Arena was the less popular than Public Access networks, which it can't be if it can afford to pay the winners up to the 200th floor upwards to MILLIONS of Jenny per win (about 100$ Jenny equals to about US$ 1). It is also jarring how pathetically weak the contestants of the tower are up to the 200th floor, at which point it seems to change the virtually flat difficulty curve of the tower with a 90&ordm; angle.<ul><li> It is also odd that Killua wasn't taught about it in his family, considering he was a prodigy taught about all else in assassination, the lack of Nen training is glaring. Ostensibly, his restrictions regarding the knowledge of Nen are imposed by his parents and older brother in order to "keep him safe" according to them. Killua mentioned that his father sent him to Heavens Arena at the age of eight, and told him not to come back until he reached the 200th floor. This was probably when Silva intended to breach the topic with him, but Killua decided to leave on his own immediately upon getting there, which likely made Silva reconsider how ready Killua really was.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMaster">Paper Master</a>: Kalluto; Wing also demonstrates to Zushi how to alter paper to use it as a weapon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>: Several cases.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">People Puppets</a>: Neferpitou, Illumi, and Shalnark.

He actually finds an interesting benefit from it in that he can psyche people out on what hand he'll throw out.</li><li> Chrollo's power stealing ability has multiple absurd conditions that pretty much requires him to acquire powers through stealth or force. Actually using those powers also requires him to keep a book open at all times and forces him to fight with one hand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though when he fights Hisoka, he figures out a workaround that lets him use multiple powers and keep his hands free.</span></li><li> To plant a bomb on people, Genthru needs to say a specific phrase while touching someone and the bomb is only armed when he explains it to people. The former condition makes it impossible for him to plant bombs on people that know what he actually is, but by the time he says the second condition, it's already too late for those he armed to do anything about it; him actually having decent fighting skills outside his primary bomb further dissuades resistance.</li><li> Netero is an interesting case in that using his nen abilities requires him to say a lengthy prayer.

Morel chides him for this, claiming that Aura has little bearing on who will win or lose in a Nen battle since it's more about strategy and ingenuity<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5o8g5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5o8g5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5o8g5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>: It's indeed hasty to judge fighters based on their Aura alone, but in this particular instance Killua was right to err on the side of caution since Pitou actually <em>was</em> so monstrously strong that running away was the smartest option by far</span>. Colt likewise states based on Aura alone that Netero would most likely get killed by the Royal Guard before even making it to the King, which is very much not what ended up happening. Aura isn't <em>completely</em> unreliable since it does have some bearing on a character's overall power, and some Aura gaps are <em>very</em> unlikely to be overcome with ingenuity alone, but it's not a very accurate way to predict the outcome of a match.<ul><li> The official data books include numbered rankings for each character's overall Nen talent, separated into 6 categories (Spirit, Skill, Strength, Nen, Talent, Intelligence) and scored on a 5 point scale (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale">or "?" for Meruem</a>).

This actually gets him a pass, as Kurapika explains that the correct response to such a question is <em>no</em> response, as such a question is one that could only be answered in the instant it occurs. Gon, Killua, and Kurapika, meanwhile, realized the answer because they caught a hint of what happened to the guy who went just before them, who tried to give the answer he thought the questioner wanted to hear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>: Illumi's Needle People carry this imagery, though they are actually closer to the traditional definition of a zombie i.e. a living person bound to the will and service of another.</li></ul></div><hr><div class="indent"><em>You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest.
