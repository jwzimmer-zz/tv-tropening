Just as he's about to leave, though, he finds out that his beautiful <em>sempai</em> Kawai Ritsu lives there, too... And so begins Usa's life at Kawai House, where none of the people are as bad as they seem (usually they're worse), and his attempt to reach out to the quiet, antisocial, and bookish girl he longs to be closer to.</p><p>An animated adaptation aired as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spring2014Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spring2014Anime">Spring 2014 Anime</a> lineup.

Usa has quit his job at the cafe at some point before. But some of the girls in his class force him to start working there again, as it's the condition of the cafe owner to loan them some outfits for their class project during the school festival. He tries to refuse, but is told by one of them that he'll be ostracized by their classmates if he refuses, forcing him to oblige.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: Ritsu goes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorFailure">Color Failure</a> after Chinatsu innocently asks her to go out with Usa in episode 10.

Even Mayumi, who was mostly just watching, is kind of creeped out.</li><li> In episode 5, Sumiko's solution to stopping a drunk and rabid Sayaka... is putting a <strong>plastic bag</strong> over her head.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheQuietOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheQuietOnes">Beware the Quiet Ones</a>:<ul><li> Ritsu usually appears as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>, but when Mayumi was about to slide down a railing, the former puts herself in front. For whatever reason, Mayumi then reconsiders it...briefly.</li><li> In episode 3, she rejects Usa's offer to ride on the back of his bike to school. He then dejectedly heads out on his own, and Ritsu stares at him for a moment, with a voiceover that says what she's thinking. Only to be subverted when it turns out it was Sayaka saying that stuff, with Shirosaki and Mayumi also watching. Ritsu then threatens to raise the rent on all three of them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>: Subverted twice in episode 3:<ul><li> The first is when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">Crazy Jealous Guy</a> confronts Sayaka, and she hides behind Usa and makes it sound like they're dating. As the guy is about to punch Usa, a book gets tossed at the back of his head. Ritsu then claims the wind made her book fly out of her hand and into the guy's head. He's surprisingly stunned long enough to believe it, but then immediately turns his attention back to Usa after she goes inside the apartment.</li><li> The second one occurs when Shirosaki shows up shortly afterwards. However, he doesn't save Usa directly; rather it's the policeman bringing Shirosaki back that causes the other guy to go away.</li><li> There is another one in episode 7 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Usa and the others saves Ritsu from a molester.</span></li><li> Sayaka saves Ritsu from a centipede in episode 9. Unlike Mayumi, Ritsu, and Usa, she's dealt with them so much back home that they don't bother her anymore.</li><li> Ritsu does this for Hayashi in the OVA, after the latter is accosted by two guys who she attended middle school with. She hits one of them with a sign she was holding, then runs off. Due to her butler outfit, the guys think Ritsu was a male student, and chase after her. Fortunately they forget about Hayashi.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a>: Usa does one in the first episode after he inadvertently steps into the girl's area, and receives a smack from Ritsu with a bamboo stick.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle">Bishie Sparkle</a>:<ul><li> Mayumi has one in episode 3 after she receives an email from her ex-boyfriend, whom the other characters can tell she hasn't gotten over yet.</li><li> Usa displays one as well at the end of episode 3. For some reason Mayumi can see it, and says she wants to hit him out of jealousy. He does it again a couple of times in episode 4.</li><li> Usa yet again in episode 5 after overhearing that Ritsu's lack of experience regarding relationships meant she just wasn't interested in anyone. It immediately gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> in that her cold behavior towards others means she's at least not interested in another guy.</li><li> Mayumi displays one after being almost convinced that she's not as pathetic as Usa is when his friend kicks him out of the group date he was just invited to. Usa immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out that</a> it wasn't a big deal to him, and wonders why she's only "almost" convinced.</li><li> Ritsu when making the mud balls in episode 10. She has this aura around her almost the entire time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>: Sayaka, who likes to manipulate men even though she has no interest in them.<ul><li> One example is seen in episode 3 when a guy confronts her in front of the apartment. She then immediately deflects the anger onto Usa by playing innocent and claiming that she has interest in him.</li><li> She puts this trope into heroic use when saving Usa from the high schoolers mocking him, and gives a little payback to the girl he went to middle school with, who threw Usa under the bus earlier by making him seem like the crazy guy who spent too much time around her instead of the other way around.</li><li> She makes fun of Mayumi in episode 11 when the latter says she doesn't want a pet because it would make them content with being single.</li><li> Tsuneko also blithely states that Sayaka was very busy with all her boyfriends and girlfriends in high school.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Bland-Name Product</a>: In the OVA, a female classmate lets Usa borrow a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlaystationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlaystationPortable">"DSD"</a> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Demon Hunter 3</a> game in it, which he used to play back in middle school. Unfortunately this scene also causes Ritsu to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest">insecure again</a>, since the girl seems to know a lot about what Usa likes, while she herself is only interested in books.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankWhiteEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankWhiteEyes">Blank White Eyes</a>:<ul><li> Sayaka displays some in episode 3 when she sees Usa's bike.</li><li> Mayumi displays them after Ritsu asks her an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a> regarding her ex-boyfriend.</li><li> The group that's mocking Usa in episode 8 at the cafe all display this when they see Ritsu in a Japanese traditional outfit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs">Blinding Bangs</a>: Shirosaki's hair covers his eyes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueWithShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueWithShock">Blue with Shock</a>: Happens on a fairly regular basis to almost all of the characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm">Bookworm</a>: Ritsu, to the point that she frequently gets home late because she's too busy reading to notice traffic signals and cross the street.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a>:<ul><li> Mayumi does this at the end of episode 8:</li></ul><div class="indent">Did you think this episode would end on a good note? Well, too bad! You got me instead!</div><ul><li> Usa does it at the very end of episode 10, after he arrives home from work and is confused about what the others did with some ball rubbing, torn pantyhose, and Ritsu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">being really upset</a> with him after mentioning Hayashi visiting him while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">barely getting any screentime.</a></li><li> Done again a couple of times in episode 11, such as when Mayumi and Sayaka say one thing, while what they really meant is displayed in words on screen, which Usa says he can read. Mayumi also shows up in one of his monologues, and changes the wording of a term he was using to spend time with Ritsu, causing him to tell her to stop showing up in those instances. And in the preview credits, Mayumi says the show can't end until she finds happiness, causing Sayaka to reply that the show would then last years.</li><li> Used at the beginning of episode 12 during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> Usa has about Ritsu at the karaoke bar. Both Mayumi and Shirosaki point out that said guy next to her turns into Usa partway through the scene when he starts getting rather aggressive with her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownBagMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownBagMask">Brown Bag Mask</a>: Shirosaki wears one in the OVA while visiting Usa and Ritsu's school festival. As one might expect, this makes him look even more suspicious, and Ritsu later forces him to take it off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBurlesqueOfVenus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBurlesqueOfVenus">The Burlesque of Venus</a>: In the second episode, Usa and Ritsu are sent to take down drapes and chance upon Shirosaki posed like this painting due to the wind, with cloth standing in for the clam and covering his chest and crotch and Mayumi clutching another large cloth next to him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>: Several characters are used for this purpose throughout the show, though Shirosaki and Mayumi get abused the most.

Though she doesn't seem to show any reaction at first, when she arrives home she's in a foul mood despite having read books. Chinatsu later pointing out he's nice to all girls doesn't help things, and when he later mentions to Mayumi that his friend did visit him at the restaurant, Ritsu gets extremely irritated at him and leaves the room in anger.

But typically it'll be Mayumi, who laments being single while younger coworkers are getting boyfriends or married. She will then often get picked on by Sayaka, and then picks on Usa to make herself feel better, usually by calling him a virgin and his lack of experience with women. He will usually reply with something to make her miserable again, or ignores her entirely, which also has the same effect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a>:<ul><li> After Sumiko tells Sayaka not to bring trouble back home in episode 3, she says she could've sworn she kept her address a secret.

When Mayumi and Shirosaki point out that said guy turns into Usa halfway through, he states that he doesn't want to imagine any other guy with Ritsu. He also seems relieved when she said she wasn't happy at the karaoke bar and didn't make any meaningful connections to any guy there. Fortunately for him, said guy Ritsu did talk to indirectly insulted Usa, and did in fact act much like Usa had imagined in the beginning, which also added to Ritsu's disgust of him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPoppingVeins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPoppingVeins">Cross-Popping Veins</a>: A few characters display these from time to time, usually Mayumi towards Sayaka.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryCute">Cry Cute</a>:<ul><li> Chinatsu in episode 6, after Mayumi gets into an argument with her.

While it was because she was a bit saddened by her ex-friend abandoning her, she claims to Usa that she was crying because the book she was reading was really emotional.

However, if she sees something funny, she'll start snickering, and fun events that the other residents take part in will usually cause her to start fidgeting uncontrollably while attempting to deny wanting to take part.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in episode 5. When Mayumi and Sayaka are leaving the living room, they notice Ritsu and Usa casually chatting about a book she loaned him. When they notice how innocent the two seem to be, they immediately get disgusted, and the words "Formation of Team Shatter Dreams" shows up as they develop devilish looks and start thinking of ways to interrupt the two. At least until Sumiko grabs them from behind.</li><li> Both women also put aside their differences to help bail Usa out in episode 8 after the students at table he's serving start mocking him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>:<ul><li> Usa first meets Ritsu in the library reading a book.

Usa's first thought is that the guy is a pervert, and he's spot on with that.</li><li> Mayumi first meets Usa when he wanders by a lakefront and sees her drinking her sorrows away. She also immediately hits on him as well. Once he realizes she was the same woman he saw in a picture Shirosaki showed him earlier, he's shocked to find out the seemingly normal looking woman is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> with lots of issues.</li><li> Sayaka first shows up in episode 2, and immediately grabs Mayumi's breasts when she sees the latter. She also shows off her traits as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>, acting innocent towards Usa. Mayumi warns him that what she's doing is just an act, and that she's not as nice as she seems.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">Everyone Can See It</a>: Virtually everyone that knows Ritsu and Usa know that he likes her, and most of them are irritated that they don't just get it out and deal with their emotions. Ritsu maintains denial about it to avoid the anxiety, while Usa doesn't want to pressure her. Even a young girl like Chinatsu points this out in episode 10, causing Ritsu to start trying to come up with various things as to why he doesn't like her. Both Mayumi and Shirosaki, who are watching this unfold, just barely hold back from saying their comments out loud at how ignorant Ritsu seems to be acting here.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">Everyone Has Standards</a>:<ul><li> Mayumi, who is normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a>, hooks back up with an ex-boyfriend briefly in episode 3. When he shows little interest in her, such as taking her out to an Italian restaurant when she doesn't even like Italian food, and wanting her more for her body, she immediately dumps him and comes back to the apartment.</li><li> Trolls they may be to Usa, but Mayumi and Sayaka are visibly disgusted by a group of students mocking him while he's trying to do his job. They even work together with Ritsu to bail him out. After the incident, they still show contempt towards Hayashi, who was among them, and the one who threw Usa under the bus, making it seem like he was the weirdo she went to middle school with.</li><li> When a molester is rumored to be around the neighborhood in episode 7, Shirosaki tries to distance himself from that guy. But several of the other characters notice that he's not really that much better than the molester based on what he tells them.</li><li> When a guy at the mixer Ritsu's at with her friend makes fun of people who ask for suggestions on books in episode 12, Ritsu gets angry with him as a result. She seemed to interpret that as an insult to what she did for Usa when she recommended books for him to try out. She does apologize for going overboard during that moment however.</li><li> In the OVA, Mayumi taunts Ritsu a little when she finds out that Usa isn't spending much time with her lately because of the school festival. Instead of getting angry, Ritsu instead seems like she's going to cry, causing Mayumi to try and get someone to change the subject. Unfortunately they talk about a game Usa borrowed from a girl in their class, which only makes Ritsu sadder. Mayumi does at least feel bad for unintentionally causing this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes">From the Mouths of Babes</a>: Chinatsu pointing out to Ritsu that Usa likes her in episode 10.

She does this to Usa in episode 3, telling him that Ritsu is opening up to him, and that he should be more persistent. But then in episode 4 Ritsu chastises him for being too aggressive, and Mayumi later reveals to him that Sayaka tends to do things like this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing">Gainaxing</a>:<ul><li> Mayumi in the ending.</li><li> Episode 7 focuses on Ritsu for a moment as well when she's walking alone in a tunnel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before being assaulted by a molester.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a>: Sayaka tries to appear as one when she first meets Usa.

Later Chinatsu and Mayumi mention working with balls. While the former is clearly referring to the mud balls they're making or the balls used at school, Mayumi's dialogue suggests a much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedDoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedDoubleEntendre">mature, alternate means</a> to that word, such as working with smaller ones at night.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsAreReallyScaredOfHorrorMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsAreReallyScaredOfHorrorMovies">Girls Are Really Scared of Horror Movies</a>:<ul><li> Played straight with Ritsu, who isn't a big fan of them, and always tries to make up some kind of excuse to not watch them, such as claiming to be sleepy while burying her face inside a pillow to avoid watching it.</li><li> Averted with Mayumi, who enjoys them quite a bit, largely because of the fact that the happy couples in them usually get killed off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GotVolunteered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GotVolunteered">Got Volunteered</a>: In episode 7, Usa wonders if he should get a part time job to pass the time during summer break. He initially brushes it off, then when he is offered a job, he declines it repeatedly despite being more than qualified for it.

And in episode 12 she lashes out at them for coming home late, and feels they deliberately came late to enjoy the sunset together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>: Sayaka says she did this after running into her ex-boyfriend at a mixer in episode 5, after he gets the wrong idea and tries to make moves on her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamToHamCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamToHamCombat">Ham-to-Ham Combat</a>: Mayumi and Usa engage in one in episode 5, after the former purposely interrupts a chat the latter was having with Ritsu.

She then brings a "curse", stating that the couples in said pictures will never last.

She tries again after finding out Usa and Ritsu aren't dating in the OVA, but her hopes are dashed again when he mentions wanting to find Ritsu.</li><li> Usa certainly feels like one in episode 11 when Ritsu meets someone new who is also genuinely interested in reading (unlike him, who largely only does it to try to get closer to her). Made funnier by the fact that said friend is a girl, so he may also be wondering if they may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">Schoolgirl Lesbians</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a>:<ul><li> Usa arrives home in episode 3 to a scene of Sayaka trying to grope and molest Mayumi, and Sumiko jumping on top of Shirosaki, at his behest. Mayumi then tells Usa to stop looking at her while Sayaka is trying to reveal her underwear, only to find out that he's not paying attention to any of them; rather he's looking at Ritsu who's balled up in the corner. Mayumi immediately hits him and tells him to pay attention to her.<ul><li> Later in episode 3, Mayumi tells Sayaka to stop causing trouble by seducing and teasing men. The latter says they keep hitting on her even after she rejects them.

Mayumi then says that men can't ever seem to get over their ex, even after the latter has gotten over them. Every other character aside from Sumiko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">immediately think</a> to themselves about how she herself is in that same boat, and has smug smiles on their faces. She later compares it to a computer program, and how men save women in different folders, while women overwrite theirs instead of adding. She gets mocked about it as a result by the other residents as they conclude this must be why she keeps going back to the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> guys.</li><li> In episode 10, Mayumi mentions doing childish things such as making shiny mud balls every now and then isn't a bad idea, referring to Ritsu wanting to take part in it. The latter then points out Mayumi is the oldest one there doing it. Ironically she keeps screwing them up, mostly by trying too hard, causing Shirosaki to crack a joke at her about how her relationships usually work out the same way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoreTheFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoreTheFanservice">Ignore the Fanservice</a>:<ul><li> Played straight with Usa towards Mayumi. This sometimes gets her really angry or depressed because of the fact that he's deliberately ignoring her.</li><li> Averted towards Ritsu. Usa is usually attentive towards anything she does even if it's not remotely sexual, such as when turns red after being teased by Sayaka about her inexperience with people. This again gets Mayumi worked up because of their tendency to have innocent high school student experiences towards the other sex, usually by blushing or acting bashfully around them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>: Usa has one in episode 12 of Ritsu being assaulted by an overly aggressive guy who strongly resembles him.

Though it's subtle, when Ritsu first hears that Hayashi is back, the camera focuses on her briefly. A few moments later, when Usa mentions Hayashi visiting more often, as well as her being an avid reader in middle school, Ritsu's face goes from happy to sad almost instantly. This may be why she brushes off any notion that Usa is interested in her when Chinatsu shows up and questions her about it.</li><li> In the OVA, Usa spending a lot of time with other classmates, particularly girls, causes Ritsu to become insecure again, particularly when one of them lets him borrow a game he use to like.

He shows up at the Usa's place in episode 9 and tries to ask her out. This immediately lifts Mayumi's spirits up, as she was depressed due to a coworker finding a boyfriend. But she's turned off by the fact that he's only fifteen. In the OVA, she wonders if Tagami is still thinking about him. Usa tells her he's going after a girl in their class. Mayumi immediately goes from cheerful to gloomy, and casts a curse on both Tagami and Usa.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">Loners Are Freaks</a>:<ul><li> One of Usa's friends assumes Ritsu is this because she's always by herself and reading in the library.

Due to peer pressure, she doesn't really defend him, and it's only due to the timely arrival of Ritsu, and later Mayumi and Sayaka that saves him from further ridicule. In episode 10 she shows up again, but is unsure how to approach and apologize to him for that incident, but Shirosaki provides her with some advice on it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>:<ul><li> In episode 2, while watching a horror movie, Ritsu, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsAreReallyScaredOfHorrorMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsAreReallyScaredOfHorrorMovies">isn't a fan of them</a>, gets suckered into staying in the room to watch it after Mayumi scares her about walking back to her room in the dark.

She tries to, but the friend then reveals that the guy at the karaoke bar saw Ritsu from a picture that girl took of them. She lashes out at her about it, and later seems to regret it after said friend makes up with some older friends and essentially says that Ritsu was a loner. Mayumi and the others at the Kawai dorm later try to reassure her, telling her that since the two didn't "click" on a certain level, they would have parted ways sooner or later anyway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseBleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseBleed">Nose Bleed</a>: Usa's fried Tagami suffers a brief one in episode 9 when he sees Mayumi in a skimpy outfit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not So Above It All</a>:<ul><li> Ritsu, who tries to appear as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>, sees Usa, Shirosaki, and Mayumi having fun with bubbles. When Usa tries to invite her, she claims she's not interested. She leaves, then comes back immediately with some slippers and sits nearby, claiming that the weather is nice. However, it's obvious to the others that she wants to join in, so they ask her again, and this time she agrees to take part.</li><li> In episode 5, during a water gun fight, Mayumi is wearing just a thin t-shirt and shorts.

When Sumiko comes into the room, she just stares at them for a moment, before Usa tells her to stop just watching it. Turns out the former was trying to get them to watch a horror movie with her, but jumped on them when she saw them just playing a game of Othello, and kind of jumped on top of Shirosaki for the heck of it.</li><li> Shirosaki gets a call from the police in episode 6. The others immediately assume he's going to get arrested for something. But it turns out he found a girl's wallet and turned it into the police.

While it's heavily hinted that she does have feelings for him, she constantly tries to bury them anytime someone tries to point out that he likes her, such as mentioning he's used to taking care of people with weird habits. Chinatsu practically does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm">Face Palm</a>, along with Mayumi and Shirosaki when Ritsu is vehemently denying this in episode 10.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>: A few are seen in throughout the show:<ul><li> Usa in the first episode after Shirosaki tells him he stepped into the girl's area, then turns around to see Ritsu about to smack him with a bamboo stick.</li><li> Usa has this look when an angry guy is about to hit him because Sayaka lied about her relationship with him.</li><li> Sayaka has this look as well when Sumiko gives her a second warning about causing trouble in her apartment after she teased him about Ritsu.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheKids">One of the Kids</a>: All three of the adults living at the complex can be considered one, though Shirosaki and Mayumi probably do this the most.

So Mayumi reverted back to her old ways, and snatches Shirosaki's drink while smacking him at the same time.</li><li> Used for comedic purposes again in episode 9. Ritsu, who normally won't allow Usa or Shirosaki into the girl's side of the dorms, lets them in to help her and Mayumi deal with a centipede while Sumiko is away for business.

As the camera pans up to Sayaka's face, the present-day Sayaka throws her arm up just in time to block the view. Usa later gets a very good look at her face without makeup.

She then motions for him to come over, and he sees that she's also holding a shinai, or wooden kendo stick.

Both Mayumi and Shirosaki are utterly shocked at how much she seems to be avoiding that subject.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: In episode 9 of the anime, several of the female characters perform an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">extreme over-the-shoulder held tilt</a> very reminiscent of the pose often used by female characters in anime by the animation house SHAFT. Considering that the most contemporary SHAFT series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi">Nisekoi</a></em>, had ended the week prior this was likely a farewell salute.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyMeGesture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyMeGesture">"Silly Me" Gesture</a>:<ul><li> Sayaka does one in the ending.</li><li> Chinatsu does one at the end of episode 10, after Usa comes home from work to find Ritsu much more irritated than usual due to Chinatsu asking a lot of personal questions regarding him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">Single-Target Sexuality</a>: Usa only has eyes for Ritsu.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake">Spit Take</a>:<ul><li> Usa does one after Mayumi says she'll allow him to grope her breasts as thanks for catching her and Ritsu when they fell off some stairs.</li><li> In episode 5, Mayumi, getting irritated at the awkward silence during dinner time after yet another embarrassing situation between Usa and Ritsu, says they need to make out or something. Both Ritsu and Usa do this simultaneously. She then says she's a little jealous at watching how innocent they are, and wants them to get "tainted" the same way she and Sayaka are with men.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>: Usa. Quite evident in episode 4, and in episode 7 he even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">mentions</a> he's no better than the molester that's currently terrorizing women in the area.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a>: Happens on a regular basis, both in the credits and in the show.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a>:<ul><li> In the first episode, Usa claims he wasn't trying to sneak a peek at Ritsu or see what room she lives while in the courtyard when Sumiko calls him for tea.</li><li> Mayumi also claims she's over her ex-boyfriend in episode 3 after he says he wants to get back with her. She says she's over him, but will humor him and see him, otherwise he won't leave her alone. But the way she says it sounds very suspicious to the others, and Ritsu says she has a big smile on her face when spotted in the hallway talking to him.</li><li> Usa, while hiding from view, thinks to himself that he's not following Ritsu or anything in episode 11 while she's walking home with a new friend, and claims they just happen to head home in the same direction.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a>:<ul><li> Usa does this after Sayaka hides behind him when an angry guy confronts her about their relationship. He tries to maintain his innocence, but is clever enough to realize that the way she says they're living together in the same apartment only makes it worse.</li><li> Usa is afflicted again after Ritsu tells him to stop worrying about her being alone so much in episode 4. Even she realizes it was too harsh and tries to apologize, but he's still stuck in shock. Hilariously he then falls over, making the sound of a stone statue being toppled.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOffYourClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOffYourClothes">Take Off Your Clothes</a>: Happens to Usa in episode 7, when Sumiko and her friend strip him into the cafe uniform. Despite having rejected the offer the previous night, and protesting it again, when Ritsu is taken aback by how he looks in it, he reluctantly agrees to take the job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: Well, it's not a bullet, but Ritsu accidentally spills some hot water in a thermos in episode 9 after being freaked out by a centipede. Usa grabs and moves her just enough so that the water hits his arm instead of her. She later realizes that his arm was burnt because of her, and applies a cold pack to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a>:<ul><li> Usa wants to have a regular high school life, since he apparently had a terrible middle school experience. Unfortunately he ends up living next door to a pervert, and his dreams for that are immediately extinguished. Made worse for him by the fact that the only thing separating their room is a thin removable wall.</li><li> Also in the first episode, as he passes by a grade school, Usa mentions hoping that he doesn't run into any weirdos. Then he sees Shirosaki peering through a hole in the fence into the school. The latter also calling out his name only freaks Usa out more as he hasn't been formally introduced yet at that point.</li><li> In episode 6, Shirosaki finds a wallet and turns it into the police. Though he didn't want a reward, the girl who owned the wallet, and her mother, came over to thank him. The girl later catches him making something, and he tells her it won't be finished for some time, but if she wants she can come over. He then tells Usa she probably won't be back because she'll be too busy with friends, only to have the girl then show back up later.</li><li> Sumiko's friend who runs a cafe says she needs someone to help her in episode 7. She then laments that she may not be able to find anyone who can handle weirdos. Then they see Usa trying to get everyone to order some food while they're all doing something else.</li><li> In episode 8, Mayumi laments that her friends set up a group date, but didn't tell her about it. Usa talks about it, prompting Mayumi to ask if he's got a group date. He denies it, then thinks to himself that if he was, he certainly wouldn't tell her about it. Then his phone rings, and his buddy on the phone asks quite loudly on the phone if he wants to go on a group date.</li><li> In episode 11, Sayaka is once again picking on Usa regarding Ritsu. He wishes that he could find out one of Sayaka's weaknesses, but doesn't know much about her. Then one of Sayaka's old middle school friends show up at the door, and later reveals one to him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that she's scared of rabbits.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong">That Came Out Wrong</a>: When Ritsu says she wouldn't mind doing it again, Usa immediately has some dirty thoughts about the way she said it. Both Shirosaki and Mayumi then tease him about it, and after Ritsu realizes what she said did sound wrong, she gives Usa an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">Armor-Piercing Slap</a> for thinking about it that way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease">The Tease</a>: Sayaka likes to do this a lot. Mayumi even tells Usa that she likes to toy with men's hearts when she really has no interest in them whatsoever.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">This Is Gonna Suck</a>:<ul><li> Usa in episode 3 when Sayaka hides behind him after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">Crazy Jealous Guy</a> confronts them. When she makes it sound like the two are dating, it only makes him angrier.</li><li> In episode 8, after Mayumi complains about not being invited to a group date, Usa gets a call from his friend inviting him to one. Unfortunately he was loud enough on the phone that everyone near Usa heard it, including Mayumi. Usa then casually tells his friend that the devil is behind him and he has to hang up while a hilariously sinister looking Mayumi lurks behind him, and then takes his phone to read the texts his friend sent him about the date.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">Too Kinky to Torture</a>: Shirosaki really enjoys it when the girls punish him. In one example, Sumiko asks him if he could go buy some fish for dinner. He then says she needs to be more abusive. She remembers, then tells him to go buy fish while insulting him. He then agrees to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>: Sayaka likes to do this to people, messing with their feelings, and in Usa's case, watching him suffer as he tries to be more friendly and open towards Ritsu such as in episode 4.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: Ritsu, Mayumi, and Sayaka all rescue Usa from a group of high schoolers who are on a group date, and also making fun of him for working there. Despite the constant bickering they usually do, they all work together to pull him out of the mess he got dragged into.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">Violently Protective Girlfriend</a>: While they're not dating, in episode 3 Ritsu shows she can have this streak in her after she throws one of her books at a guy who was about to punch Usa out of misaimed jealousy towards Sayaka. She claims he was just in her way into the apartment, but he appreciates the help.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction">We Need a Distraction</a>: When Ritsu's new friend in episode 11 says she wants to visit where Ritsu lives, Usa overhears it, and is smart enough to get the other residents out of there before the new friend meets them and sees how crazy they are. He gets Mayumi and Sayaka to leave by claiming he saw a location where unmarried doctors were gathering, and gets Shirosaki out of the picture by saying he suddenly feels like tying someone up in his room.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: A little girl gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a> to Shirosaki at the start of episode 6. The other characters, who were observing nearby, are understandably shocked.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> At the end of episode 3, Sayaka tells Usa that he should be more proactive and aggressive in trying to befriend Ritsu. He tries this out in episode 4, only for Ritsu to get really mad at him for trying too hard.</li><li> Mayumi gets into an argument with a little girl in episode 6, causing the latter to run off crying. Sayaka really enjoys rubbing this in on her as a result.</li><li> In episode 8, Hayashi, a girl that Usa went to middle school with, and was also one of the big reasons he earned his weird nickname "Freak show", throws Usa under the bus when the group she comes into his cafe with mocks him. While Hayashi doesn't criticize him directly, she also lies about their relationship, making it look like Usa was the one who had all the weird stuff to talk about to her instead of the other way around, as seen in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a>. She does apologize to him for putting up with her and for her not defending him at all in episode 10, though he more or less forgives her for it thanks to Ritsu's intervention.</li><li> In the OVA, Tagami shows some girls in their class a picture of Usa when he was working at the cafe, though he quit working there by this time. They then take him to the cafe, and force him to work again for the owner so they could get some outfits for their cafe at the school festival. Usa gets mad at Tagami for this, but goes along with it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">When She Smiles</a>:<ul><li> Ritsu at first appears to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>, but Shirosaki says she does display emotions too. Usa gets to see this at the end of the first episode after having broken Ritsu and Mayumi's fall with his face.</li><li> In episode 5, Ritsu notices Usa reading one of her latest books. He then says because she's usually influenced by her books, he was curious to see if this book was the reason why, and found it interesting and funny. They chat for a small while, then Ritsu allows him to borrow the book. As she's walking by Mayumi and Shirosaki, both of them notice the big genuine smile on her face as she walks away.</li><li> Ritsu again in episode 12 after exchanging contact information with Usa on their phones.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>:<ul><li> In episode 9, while Ritsu is reading a book in her bed, a large centipede falls onto it. She's so freaked out by it that she ends waking up Mayumi, Usa, and Shirosaki to help her deal with it. Naturally it escapes, and later falls onto the back of Ritsu's t-shirt.</li><li> In episode 11, Sayaka in almost the exact situation, only it was a rabbit and Usa was by himself. She threatens to make him cry if he ever revealed this weakness to Mayumi, but Usa is already in tears due to seeing Sayaka without makeup on and probably already fearing for his life knowing what she could do.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WisdomFromTheGutter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WisdomFromTheGutter">Wisdom from the Gutter</a>: Mayumi and Shirosaki, despite their own issues, can sometimes pass along meaningful advice to Usa and Ritsu, such as when Shirosaki notices Ritsu and Usa suffering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> in episode 4 after she berated him for his recent behavior and tries to tell her he didn't mean any harm by it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock">Writer's Block</a>: Shirosaki is revealed by Sumiko to be an author in episode 5. He verifies it, but says he's not writing at the moment because he's hit a slump.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: Sayaka throws Usa under the bus when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">Crazy Jealous Guy</a> angrily confronts her regarding their relationship. She makes it sound like she's dating Usa, while he tries to maintain his innocence in it, and the other guy's anger understandably gets thrown on Usa instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>: Chinatsu, a little girl that shows up in episode 6, turns out to have some issues with her classmates after she seemed mean to one of them. However, the residents of the Kawai complex help her out with it, and they make up by the end of the episode, with some help from Shirosaki's Pythagoras Switch, or "Rube Goldberg machine".</li></ul><hr>
