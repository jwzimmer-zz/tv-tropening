It spawned four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> series, several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA">OVAs</a> and two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">live-action</a> movies (one from Hong Kong starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a> and a French one much later).

At a young age, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes">used as a test subject</a> for a unique LSD derivative which resulted in him developing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes">Super Reflexes</a>. He trained these reflexes as a guerilla in that country's civil war before escaping to the United States and thence to Japan. In Japan, he teamed up with former police detective Hideyuki Makimura to form the "City Hunter" sweeper agency; ostensibly, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">Private Detective</a>, but will go further for certain clients - he's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">Hitman with a Heart</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The "comedy" comes into play whenever Ryo sees a beautiful woman. Somehow, that LSD derivative had as much of a positive effect on his sexuality as it did his reflexes. He has a sex drive of truly epic proportions, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">a physique guaranteed to make just about any woman happy to be its focus</a>... which is just about the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">Restraining Bolt</a> this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniac</a> <em>has</em> - he <strong>knows</strong> that he's everything he claims to be, and is thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">always patient enough to wait until the girl's in the mood to get wild.</a> He's not above what most would consider outright sexual harassment, however... as long as the girl seems amused by it.</p><p>In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Ataru Moroboshi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">was</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> - right down to <em><strong>being the hero of his own series!</strong></em></p><p>Early in the manga, Hideyuki dies on a case, asking Ryo to look after his much younger adoptive sister, Kaori.

Saeko often hires the City Hunter team to look into affairs the police can't publicly investigate or cannot prove that an actual crime has occurred.</p><p>The standard procedure for hiring City Hunter is to leave a message for "XYZ" at the Shinjuku train station, after which Kaori makes a preliminary investigation before introducing the prospective client to Ryo. Naturally, many of their cases bypass this procedure.
