It first ran in Hakusensha's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/HanaToYume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/HanaToYume">Hana to Yume</a></em> magazine from July 1998 to November 2006.</p><p>After the death of her mother, young Tohru Honda has been secretly living on her own in a tent. Her life changes forever when she stumbles upon the secret of the estate she is living on illegally: the land is owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">the Sohma family</a>, who are afflicted by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryCurse">Hereditary Curse</a> that changes thirteen members of the family into animals of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternZodiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternZodiac">Eastern Zodiac</a> (plus the Cat, an animal who would have been part of the Zodiac but was left out) when they are hugged by someone of the opposite sex that is not also a Zodiac member.

Originally translated to completion by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a>, the story was re-translated and re-released in omnibus format by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YenPress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YenPress">Yen Press</a> in North America.</p><p>The series was first adapted as an anime TV series in 2001, which ran from July 5 to December 27 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TVTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TVTokyo">TV Tokyo</a>. It was produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDeen">Studio DEEN</a> and directed by Akitaroh Daichi. Due to a hand injury she suffered, Takaya became heavily involved in the anime's production and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisownedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisownedAdaptation">notably disappointed by it</a>. However, that didn't stop it from becoming a popular success. It is licensed in North America by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In July 2015, Takaya announced that <em>Fruits Basket</em> would be receiving a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/07/16-1/fruit-basket-mange-new-series-another-to-launch-in-september">sequel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the form of a side story titled <em>Fruits Basket another</em>. Taking place after the main trio graduate, the story focuses on a young girl named Sawa Mitoma instead as she goes through her first days in high school. The side story premiered online starting in September 2015, and ended with three volumes in 2018. This sequel has a few one-shots written after the conclusion of the main manga, however.</p><p>Another post-series spinoff, <em>Fruits Basket: The Three Musketeers Arc</em>, concerns the titular trio of Shigure, Hatori, and Ayame discussing the aftermath of the main story. This lasted for three chapters, but was announced to have a follow-up installment.</p><p>In November 2018, it was announced that <em>Fruits Basket</em> would have a second animated adaptation produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TMSEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TMSEntertainment">TMS Entertainment</a> and directed by Yoshihide Ibata, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText">follows the original manga's story more closely</a>. It premiered on TV Tokyo (which also aired the first anime) in April 2019, with the second season premiering in April 2020 and the third and final season set to premiere in 2021.</p><p>Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/FruitsBasket">this page</a> for tropes that can be applied directly to the characters.</p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><hr><h2><em>Fruits Basket</em> provides examples of:</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-G&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Be thankful you weren't raised in this series. If your parents aren't abusive, they'll be dead in five minutes. The only characters who don't have abusive parents grow up to hate themselves. In the case of the Sohma's, it's <em>partially</em> justified: being cursed and locked in abuse cycles for generations doesn't make them good parent material.<ul><li> If you want a full list, we've got:<ul><li> Yuki and Ayame, whose parents <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kicked Ayame out at a very young age and used Yuki's existence purely for self-gain, since the Rat is considered "special" by the Sohma family, worth a lot of money and prestige for the parents</span>.</li><li> Kyo, whose dad <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> blames him for his mom to committing suicide, despite how it was <em>his</em> abusing her for giving birth to the cat that drove her to it. She in turn kept Kyo from going outside and pretended to love his true form when she didn't, until she couldn't pretend anymore and killed herself</span>.</li><li> Momiji, whose mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">went insane over the fact that her son could turn into a rabbit, and chose to have all her memories of him erased, to the point where only his father is left to care for him, which he fails to do by abandoning Momiji to live a peaceful life with his wife and new daughter</span>.</li><li> Rin, whose parents were actually fun and nurturing until she asked them a simple question, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they flipped out, stopped pretending to love her, and physically and mentally abused her so badly that her health deteriorated (including stress-induced ulcers!), and eventually abandoned her after their abuse left her hospitalized</span>.</li><li> Kyoko Honda, whose parents emotionally neglected her because they were more focused on what neighbors thought than what their daughter wanted, then kicked her out when she got hospitalized trying to leave the gang.</li><li> Arisa Uotani, whose father was an alcoholic and whose mother left him for another man. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though a quick scene in the present shows that her relationship with her father is better now.</span></li><li> Kakeru Manabe and Machi Kuragi, whose father is filthy rich and as a result, their respective mothers (one in marriage, one a mistress) forced them to be the best at everything to compete with each other for his money and influence. (At least until Kakeru finally told his mom to back off.)</li><li> Machi got the worst of it. While her mother gave up pushing her when she no longer had to compete with the mistress's son, she is still very critical and dismissive of her daughter, and blames her for being "dull" when the whole reason Machi became so was to live up to her mother's ridiculously high expectations. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Machi's parents also kicked her out the second she tried to interact with her baby brother, because they assumed she had "always been jealous" of him and wanted to murder him, when all she wanted to do was cover him with a blanket so he wouldn't be cold.</span></li><li> While Kagura isn't hit with as much abuse as the others, her parents are always fighting. They fought so much that she spent a large portion of her childhood hating herself, believing that they fought because she was one of the Zodiac.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito</span> is actually one of the characters who received the worst abuse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ren, her mother,</span> hated her for getting attention from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akira, her father,</span> and thus proceeded to mistreat and belittle her at every turn, one of the worst examples being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> forcing her to live as a man so that she could be the only woman Akira loved</span>.</li><li> For a very short while, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyoko</span> was this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tohru</span>, in the form of neglect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Katsuya's death, Kyoko fell into a state of despair in which she did nothing but lie on the floor all day, not feeding or looking after her daughter. Katsuya's father often came to their home to take care of Tohru, and for days he was not around, Tohru took care of both herself and her mother.</span> She gets better when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">travels to the sea to commit suicide, and hears a child crying for her mother. This reminds her of her daughter, alone at home, and she rushes back to Tohru, vowing to never abandon her again</span>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RieKugimiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RieKugimiya">Rie Kugimiya</a> voiced a character named Kagura. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Sound</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onmyoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onmyoji">familiar</a>?<ul><li> In the dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiaBallard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiaBallard">Kagura</a> called Kyo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranXX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranXX">"darling"</a>.</li><li> The reboot sees Haru throw a catchphrase from one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert">Kyle Hebert</a>'s more known roles in President Takei's face.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Haru:</strong> *to Takei* <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Just who the hell do you think you are?</a></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: Due to the first anime only running 26 episodes, a lot of events were moved around in the 2019 reboot:<ul><li> The chapter where Tohru first visits the Sohma estate and the chapter where she first sees Hatori's Zodiac form are combined into one episode in both adaptations of the anime.</li><li> In the manga, Tohru meets Hiro and Ritsu <em>after</em> the incident <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Kyo's "true" form</span>, but in the first anime, it happens before, since their particular meetings are self-contained. Rin and Kureno's meetings with Tohru, on the other hand, take place during the Beach Arc, so they don't appear in the first anime.</li><li> Mayuko-sensei is replaced with the gym teacher in all of her scenes, and she isn't mentioned when Ayame gives Hatori the pictures of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kana's wedding</span>, which he got from her in the manga.</li><li> In episode 3 of the reboot, some events from chapter 8 (the preparations for the culture fest, Momiji's first meeting with Tohru, and the riceball analogy) are moved here. The last one nicely foreshadows episode 5, however.</li><li> Episode 6 combines the culture fest with the sleepover. The two events also occur in reverse order, transitioned by Tohru accidentally slipping out that she's been staying with the Somas when Uo and Hana confront her about being casual with Yuki.</li><li> Episode 23 has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode">Sick Episode</a> in its first half, extracting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> that resulted from Kyo taking leeks from Yuki's garden.

Tohru gets the chance to have one-on-one bonding time with her when she follows her to the store and they walk home together. The scene where Tohru learns about Kyo's passion for martial arts is also altered; as it takes place before Kagura finishes cooking rather than before bedtime like in the manga.</li><li> In episode 5, additional scenes showed what Yuki and Kyo were doing as they searched for the Honda home while Tohru herself had to face her relatives.</li><li> In episode 7, the reboot adds an expanded flashback of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito pulling an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a> on Hatori's left eye, complete with <em>blood</em>.

Her last thoughts, as she lies bleeding to death in the road, are complete panic at the idea that her daughter will be left all alone and uncared for.

They also love it unconditionally and can never blame it for anything. Unfortunately for the owner of the dragon spirit, a little wordplay means that instead of turning into an actual <em>dragon</em> (which would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">badass</a></em>), he turns into a &#31452;&#12398;&#33853;&#12375;&#23376; (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeahorsesAreDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeahorsesAreDragons">"tatsu no otoshigo"; "baby dragon"), or "seahorse"</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Shigure in the manga says that the curse is falling apart and even the animal forms are half-baked forms of what they used to be, and he actually says: "Look at Hatori, for example."</span>.
