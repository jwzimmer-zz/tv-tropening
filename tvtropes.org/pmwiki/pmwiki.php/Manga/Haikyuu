Hinata starts his own volleyball club, which no one joins, and practices rigorously by himself. Eventually he convinces enough people to make up a rag-tag team consisting of a couple of members who haven't even played volleyball before just so he could compete in a tournament. His team is quickly annihilated by Tobio Kageyama - "King of the Court" - and his champion team. After suffering a miserable defeat, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama and surpass him as a volleyball player.</p><p>Upon entering Karasuno High School - the school "The Little Giant" attended - Hinata learns that he's now on the same team as Kageyama.

An anime adaptation aired during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spring2014Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spring2014Anime">Spring 2014 Anime</a> season for two cours produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ProductionIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ProductionIG">Production I.G</a>, and has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in America.

The tone he uses sounds similar to how Kageyama calls Hinata one, which amuses Asahi so much that he (along with Sugawara) asks Daichi to do it again.</li><li> Nohebi members trashtalk Lev in an attempt to rile him up, saying he's going to miss his spikes. Kenma (who scolded Lev for poor play earlier) fails to hide a chuckle, much to Lev's annoyance.</li><li> In Tsubakihara's Round 1 Nationals match, their pinch server is subbed into the first set. However, he's so nervous that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he sends the ball flying into the ace Teradomari's head</span>, much to everyone's shock. Despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having just lost the set thanks to this error</span>, the captain Echigo can't contain his laughter because he finds it too hilarious.</li><li> In a flashback when Osamu and Atsumu got into a physical fight, their teammates were mortified... except for Suna, who proceeded to record the fight on his phone.</li><li> Bokuto yells out mid-match, during a tense moment, that he's tired and that volleyball is tiring. Everyone around him is dumbfounded by this sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a> outburst. The captain of the opposing team, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kiryuu</span>, can't help but let out a chuckle due to the ridiculousness, something he would usually never do during a game if the shocked reaction from his younger teammate is anything to go by.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlothole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlothole">Adaptation Induced Plothole</a>:<ul><li> At the Miyagi Spring High Preliminaries final, Karasuno's cheer squad solely consists of the Karasuno Neighbourhood Association (contrasting Shiratorizawa who boasts a mighty student cheer squad). Since no one from their school watches it, Hinata's classmates assume he's just a benchwarmer who does chores, not believing him when he says he's actually a regular on the team. This scene makes less sense in the anime adaptation where the vice-principal organises a Karasuno student cheer squad the very last minute to bring to the match, meaning students would have seen Hinata in action.</li><li> The stage plays omit Narita due to constraint issues. This creates a problem in the adaptation of the Shiratorizawa match when Tsukishima needs to get medical attention and is temporarily taken out of the game. In the original, Narita is the one to sub in for him since he's a middle blocker and so usually replaces Hinata or Tsukishima; in this adaptation, Ennoshita is used despite not being the right position (wing spiker) with no proper explanation given.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: Multiple characters are not present in <em>Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyuu!!</em> plays due to budget and time constraints. Often their parts are given to other characters in the play, for example Shimizu's lines getting delegated to the third-years and Ennoshita in the first play. Some characters get added in later installments, for example Shimizu and Kinoshita.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>: A few characters in the Japanese high school volleyball scene are at least darker skinned than the majority - Aran Oojiro, Reon Ohira and Nobuyuki Kai. Aran is explicitly black; Ohira and Kai don't have shaded skin in the manga but are some lighter shades of brown in the anime or official coloured art and share some features commonly associated with the black community (thicker lips and/or frizzy hair). It's never made clear if they have any foreign heritage or belong to any particular minority groups.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>:<ul><li> Tsukishima letting out a victorious shout after his "moment" in season 3 is animated in a way that looks more like CGI than traditional animation and it is glorious.</li><li> Season 4 has noticeably more dynamic animation, with certain details (such as hair and jumps) having more fluidity than seen in previous seasons.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: Volleyball teams are symbolised by animals so often that it could be considered a signature of the series. Some characters in those teams even have their own distinct animal motifs.<ul><li> Crows for <em>Karasu</em>no. The Karasuno players are compared to crows several times:<ul><li> The fact that like small birds breaking the egg's shell and learning to fly, they're continuously trying to evolve.</li><li> They eventually learn how to unify the team's strengths like a color blend that achieves pure black (black, naturally, being the color of crows).</li><li> Crows are omnivorous, which relates to the team's hunger for victory and evolution.</li></ul></li><li> Cats for <em>Neko</em>ma. In their very introduction, Ukai compares them to cats due to their flexibility (in the context, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">their power of defense</a>). They also have other similar motifs inside their own team, with the "Inu" in Inuoka meaning "dog", fitting to his role as Hinata's 'chaser' during the practice match against Nekoma, and Lev meaning "lion" in Russian, owing to his large build and seeing himself as Nekoma's ace.</li><li> Owls for Fukurodani. Bokuto in particular greatly resembles the animal thanks to his spiky hairstyle.</li><li> The 'shiratori' kanji in 'Shiratorizawa' means 'swan'. Interestingly enough, Ushijima is shown symbolically with an eagle instead.</li><li> Snakes for No<em>hebi</em>, which comprises rather unpleasant players that sneakily rely on cheap tactics to win points.</li><li> Foxes for Inarizaki. Inari is the Japanese god of foxes, and most of the members are named after different species of foxes.</li><li> Seagulls for <em>Kamome</em>dai, with the ace Hoshiumi strongly resembling one.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: Yamaguchi, of all people, dramatically delivers a question to Tsukishima in Chapter 88 which stuns him.<div class="indent"><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> Motivation? WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED THAN PRIDE?!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports">Artistic License &#150; Sports</a>: <em>Haikyuu!!</em> sometimes plays things up for epic effect, but otherwise generally follows the rules and keeps things to realistic levels unlike other sports anime and manga. An exception is Kageyama's "falling toss" in the updated freak quick; it has the setter (Kageyama) setting the ball incredibly fast yet also killing its momentum by giving it spin and having it stop right where the spiker (Hinata) is about to hit it (ie. if not spiked, it will fall right at that spot). Even if it's possible to do, it would likely break the rules since the amount of spin suggests Kageyama would have to do a double touch in real life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>:<ul><li> The manga and anime can go from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> drawings (often for comedic effect) to amazingly stunning artwork (especially in epic or emotional scenes) in one page or second.</li><li> Whenever powerful attacks are shown, the art style shifts into a highly frenetic, heavily-inked style more reminiscent of Street Fighter than the rest of the series. This includes Asahi's spike against Date Tech, Oikawa's serves (particularly the ones that emphasize force), Kyoutani's first play against Karasuno, and Ushijima's spikes.</li><li> During the Tokyo Expedition arc, Takatora, Tanaka, and Nishinoya are drawn more akin to the art style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure">Jojos Bizarre Adventure</a></em> when trying to "protect" Shimizu from the other players.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShiftedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShiftedSequel">Art-Shifted Sequel</a>: Season 4 of the anime adaptation marks the debut of the new art style. While Seasons 1-3 of the anime matches the initial manga design, it does not reflect the gradual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> the manga underwent; and so by Season 3 the anime had some stylistic differences compared to the manga chapters it was adapting (such as the slightly different hair and eyes and the toned down muscles). The Season 4 designs follows the later manga art more closely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">Back for the Finale</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Every character makes their series return in the final arc after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. Some characters, especially Hinata and Kageyama's main circle, are frequently shown watching their match, while eeryone else is given brief one-two panel appearances. The audience is updated on their ages as well as current status (whether it be studying, working in a common job and/or working as a pro volleyball player.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>: You can bet that every character who says at least a few lines has got some sort of backstory, whether it be the main characters or players from a team that has only appeared for three chapters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a>: The Johzenji team attempt to imitate Karasuno&#146;s synchronized attack after seeing it just once, surprising everyone.

Yachi is the younger and flatter girl who's timid and sweet; Saeko is the older and bustier girl who's fierce and boisterous. Both are equally nice and strike up a good friendship in the short time they spend together (although Yachi briefly gapes at Saeko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing">Gainaxing</a> chest in horrow while covering her own).

In typical <em>Haikyuu!!</em> fashion, this call-back ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SneezeCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SneezeCut">Sneeze Cut</a> to Matsukawa on the train somewhere back in Miyagi.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">Calling Your Attacks</a>: Calling out one's attacks is occasionally parodied by players during comical moments, and it's also sometimes downplayed when players mentally yell out the name of their techniques during a match (as saying it out loud is naturally not practical).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfPrettyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfPrettyBoys">Cast Full of Pretty Boys</a>: Although only few of the male players are explicitly stated to be attractive (such as Oikawa), the character designs of most guys are generally easy on the eyes and strongly outnumber the female cast (justified as this series focuses on boys' volleyball).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd">Cast Herd</a>: This being a sports story, characters are sorted with the team they're affiliated with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>: Every single player on a team gets a name and has very distinct features.

This can have a positive effect on how well they work together on the court; this is why spectators regularly mistake Hinata and Kageyama to be longtime friends when they've actually only known each other since their match in junior high, considering how fluidly they play together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatCommentator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatCommentator">Combat Commentator</a>: Match commentary is often provided to the audience by benched players, coaches, or veterans like Shimada, Takinoue and Akiteru.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">Compressed Adaptation</a>:<ul><li> The 10-episode Season 3 adapts the Shiratorizawa match, which is about 40 chapters in the manga and so adapted at a rate of four chapters per episode.

Season 3 glosses over some details as a result, going as far as to skip Set 3 altogether.</li><li> The Tokyo qualifying matches for Spring High lasts for 26 chapters (almost two volumes). These were adapted into two OVA episodes totalling to 45 minutes, leading to a lot of skipped content (including reduced screentime for characters like Konoha, Yamamoto and Kuguri, as well as less development for plot points like Nohebi's dirty tactics).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>:<ul><li> At one point when we first meet Lev, he apologizes to Kenma for being so forward and demanding when he calls for the ball, and Kenma tells him that he doesn't need to be so formal about it.

When Saeko manages to get the Karasuno cheer squad fired up at one point, they simply get drowned out by the Shiratorizawa side singing their school song. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is what motivates Saeko to gather her taiko team and act as Karasuno's cheer support at Nationals, so that the team doesn't have to deal with an overwhelming rival cheer squad again.</span></li><li> One of the teams at nationals, Inarizaki, even uses the cheer chants and music to their advantage. They know that they're a popular team with a wildly large crowd following and school cheer squad, so their cheer squad has specific cheers designed to destabilize the other team while they're serving or trying to make snap judgements. The stadium gets noticeably quieter and more positive when Inarizaki is serving, and the crowd goes as far as to boo players on the other team who made a good save or scored a point. It's a stunningly effective demoralizer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake">Crushing Handshake</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is Daichi and Kuroo shaking hands with a lot more strength than necessary.

One of Shiratorizawa's qualifying sets ended <em>25-6</em> in their favour.</li><li> Hinata&#146;s first match against Kageyama went poorly, with their scores not even surpassing 10 points. Hinata&#146;s team was composed mostly of amateurs, while Kageyama&#146;s team was the championship favorite.</li><li> Karasuno's match against Date Tech prior to the story was so one-sided that even Asahi, the ace, couldn't fight against their height.</li><li> Karasuno's performance at the Tokyo summer training camp is a lot less impressive than usual, since they've only just started to learn their new techniques.

The boys often have crushes or soft spots for them, and teams without female managers usually bemoan their lack of this trope. Although played straight, the focus and development of Karasuno's managers remind the audience that their jobs genuinely are important: Shimizu takes her duties very seriously which is what spurs her to look for a successor, and one of the first things Yachi does as manager is to make a poster advertising Karasuno to (successfully!) raise funds for their trips.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed Trope</a> in the series when it comes to receiving left-handed spikes; their rotation is opposite that of a right-hander's spike, and makes them more difficult to receive properly because the receiver will be used to a right-handed spiker's rotation.

When Karasuno defeats Aoba Johsai, the TV news focuses on Aoba Johsai's loss and laments how they wouldn't be participating in the finals. When Karasuno wins in the finals, the audience is completely stunned since Shiratorizawa were the expected victors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>: Due to the large casts, many characters other than the main duo Kageyama and Hinata get some attention and development at some point, especially the other members of Karasuno and the star players of their rival teams. Every team they play against generally gets to have perspective shots and flashbacks to when they were practising and stating their own goals, which usually are very similar to Karasuno's own.<ul><li> In particular, the main focus often shifts to Nekoma and Fukurodani later on whenever the story takes a break from Karasuno's side, giving the teams some development and backstory. The first OVA, <em>The Arrival of Haiba Lev</em>, mainly shows the Nekoma team back in Tokyo and the difficulty in training Lev. After the conclusion of the Spring High Preliminaries in Miyagi, Chapters 190 to 206 (adapted as the OVA prequel to Season 4) shifts the attention to the Tokyo preliminaries which is where Nekoma and Fukurodani are competing. The arc focuses on two matches &mdash; Nekoma vs. Fukurodani, and Nekoma vs. Nohebi.

Hundreds of chapters later, Kageyama senses that his old bad habits as the "King of the Court" are coming back and fears it'll sour his relationship with the team like it did with Kitagawa Daiichi; Hinata is the one to point out that it's actually not a bad thing, since everyone appreciates his efforts to push the team to improve (and they can always disagree with him if they want to). This helps Kageyama to drop all the emotional baggage he felt from his "King" nickname and be more direct with his teammates in matches (within reason).</li><li> Akaashi, on multiple occasions, calms down a moody and unstable Bokuto with the help of his team, by giving him time to cool off and creating opportunities for him to get back into the groove. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the Mujinazaka match, Akaashi is the one who panics for majority of the first set and is sent to the bench so he can regroup.

Tanaka assumes he's her older boyfriend and runs off in embarrassment, since he was in the midst of rejecting her (thinking she was going to confess to him).

For example, whenever he's not coaching, Ukai will often explain things to Takeda early in the series since he doesn't know much about the sport yet, and Shimada and Takinoue's constant presence in Karasuno's matches usually brings a lot of commentary which is handy for the ignorant like Saeko.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightAndDayDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightAndDayDuo">Night and Day Duo</a>: This motif is present in the contrast between Karasuno's two first-year middle blockers, Hinata <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4lfev');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4lfev" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4lfev');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">written with the kanji for "sun"</span>, who is friendly, vibrant, and warm, and Tsukishima<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5fz56');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5fz56" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5fz56');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">written with the kanji for "moon"</span>, who is cold, aloof, and distant.

Variations of the school uniform are sometimes seen to help show characters' personalities (such as the energetic Hinata wearing a hoodie under his <em>gakuran</em>) but not often, since teams other than Karasuno are rarely seen outside their volleyball clothes; and there's not much that can customised with the volleyball uniforms, so subtle changes or additions are seen at best (such as the length or number of knee pads).</li><li> As per volleyball rules, the libero uniforms are purposely different from the other members, often by reversing the colours (for example Nishinoya's uniform is orange with black details, while the rest of Karasuno's uniforms are black with orange details). Liberos frequently go on and off court, so being in different uniforms makes it easier for the referee to know who they are. The uniforms are flipped when they're in their away uniforms.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a>: Many characters befriend those with opposing personalities, ranging from Hinata and Kenma to Bokuto and Akaashi.

The closest team that fits this trope is Nohebi at the Spring High Tokyo qualifiers &mdash; the members have bad personalities, provoke their opponents in a nasty way, and suck up to the referees and linesmen so that any fouls they may have committed are overlooked. And even in their case, it's eventually shown that they too can be worthy opponents and are not <em>that</em> terrible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OralFixation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OralFixation">Oral Fixation</a>: Saeko's sucking on a lollipop when driving Hinata and Kageyama to Tokyo, and the camera focuses on her lips a few times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNervousFlopSweat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNervousFlopSweat">Overly Nervous Flop Sweat</a>: Characters often over-sweat in a comedic manner when uncomfortable in some way, such as a nervous Hinata whenever he's faced with taller, burlier opponents.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam">P.O.V.

This allows the audience to witness Karasuno's gameplay, in particular Hinata and Kageyama' quick attack, through the opponent's eyes.</li><li> The camera twice switches to the receiver's point of view when they're about to receive a nasty serve or spike. First is Daichi receiving an infamous Oikawa serve on Aoba Johsai's match point at the Spring High Preliminaries, while he has flashbacks of all the horrible serves he faced during training (including one from Ukai Sr). Second is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hinata when he makes a perfect receive on Aran's spike (which no one else anticipated), and he has a flashback of all the first years at the Miyagi camp (and Ushijima) spiking the ball.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a>:<ul><li> Since accurately recreating every single Haikyuu volleyball play is impossible in real life, the stage play adaptation reinterprets the volleyball matches as choreographed acrobatic/dance-like sequences. The screen provides visuals like the "volleyball" and the scores, and an actual ball on a stick held by a props person is also used for some scenes when the ball is specifically needed. This is effective, as basic volleyball movements like spiking and blocking are still kept while the choreography and music helps show the teams' different styles and how well they're playing.</li><li> Story-wise, many minor details are cut out in order to fit the running time and push the focus to the more plot points without affecting the pacing. For example, the stage plays take out minor matches (such as Ohgi Minami/Kakugawa and Tsubakihara) to push the major ones in the spotlight (Johzenji/Wakutani and Inarizaki, respectively); and in order to fit two matches in a single play, points/sets are shortened or skipped over in favour of the more dramatic sets, such as the Aoba Jousai rematch and Shiratorizawa match in <em>The Strongest Team</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>: While Spring High usually only has one round of matches a day (and that's already tiring due to the high intensity), the third day is known as "Day Three Hell" because both Round 3 and the quarterfinals are played that day. That means teams that win their Round 3 match will have to deal with the exhaustion carrying over to their next match mere hours later, which can affect how well they play. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is a factor to Karasuno's loss to Kamomedai in the quarterfinals &mdash; putting aside the latter being <em>very</em> formidable opponents, Karasuno's condition is affected by their draining three-set win against Nekoma earlier that day. Two of the players hit hardest are Tsukishima and Hinata in Set 3; Tsukishima's stamina issues kick in and forces him to the bench, and Hinata is taken out of the match altogether because he's developed a fever from the lack of rest in between matches and concentrating a lot more than usual.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuizzicalTilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuizzicalTilt">Quizzical Tilt</a>: Common in the series, but happens the most with Hinata and Kageyama.

It's only after he runs away that the audience finds out the man is her cousin. Tanaka himself finds out the next day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatCut">Repeat Cut</a>: Multiple cuts of one scene are often done in the anime, such as Tsukishima's epic block against Ushijima during the Karasuno vs Shiratorizawa match which is repeated from three different angles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>: Takeda is fond of giving motivational speeches. They tend to be full of analogies, though sometimes he ends them wondering if his words were too flowery or pompous for the boys to understand. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Hinata and Kageyama</a> indeed sometimes don't quite get it, but intention is what counts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>:<ul><li> Hinata is frequently vomiting during bus or car rides (especially when he's nervous), which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.</li><li> Hinata tends to run into people from opponent teams while going to the restroom before a match.

Tanaka especially takes pride as the first year's upperclassman, feeling obligated to beg his sister to drive Hinata and Kageyama to Tokyo so they wouldn't miss the training camp.</li><li> Kenma appears to resent this kind of relationship, because his former upperclassmen from the volleyball club used to ignore him and see whatever he had to say as impertinence, just because he was an underclassman.

In the scope of sports manga, and sh&#333;nen manga more broadly, Haikyuu stands out for being relatively realistic in the match-ups and the outcomes, with teams that are considered in-story as underdogs to lose most of the time:<ul><li> Hinata's team of friends in middle school (where two members don't actually play volleyball and the other three are only first years) has the misfortune of playing Kageyama's team from a powerhouse middle school. Despite the few flimmers of hope courtesy of Hinata's excellent reflexes, the match ends with the obviously superior team winning by a large margin, averting this trope.</li><li> The protagonist team Karasuno zig-zags this trope. On one hand, they've been nicknamed the "fallen crows" due to their drop in performance in recent years. On the other hand, they're a former powerhouse and have been described as a mediocre or middling team, and their starting lineup includes two people described in-story as geniuses (Kageyama and Nishinoya) and another described as having inhuman levels of stamina and reflexes (Hinata). So even when they are on the winning side of in-story upsets and this trope is in play, it's toned down. The trope is also averted at times to show that Karasuno still has areas to work on despite their improved lineup.<ul><li> At the Interhigh Preliminaries in Miyagi, Karasuno look to be in decent shape when they not only comfortably win their first round match but also surprisingly beat the infamous blocking team Date Tech (who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomped</a> them in their last meeting). However Karasuno has only just recently begun training as a team together and still have some flaws (notably the limitations of the freak quick attack), leading them to lose (albeit narrowly) to powerhouse Aoba Johsai in the third round.</li><li> Karasuno wins four sets and loses a whopping 70 sets during their Tokyo summer training camp with the Fukurodani group. Justified as 1) the group comprises four powerhouse teams from Kanto and 2) the Miyagi school have just started trying out their new techniques at this point.</li><li> In their revenge match up at the Spring High Preliminaries with Aoba Johsai, a school favored to reach the finals to battle it out against Shiratorizawa as they did the year prior, Karasuno wins in three tight sets, surprising everyone and giving <em>them</em> the chance to go up against the reigning Miyagi champions Shiratorizawa in the finals. To everyone's further shock, they <em>succeed</em>, propelling them to Nationals once more.</li></ul></li><li> The trope comes up at Spring High, but is defied just as often. Spring High emphasises that no matter how strong your team is, victory isn't guaranteed and anything can happen from being outplayed to just getting bad luck. To drive the point home, out of the top four seeded teams, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>none</em> of them make it to the semifinals; Inarizaki loses to Karasuno in Round 2, the unrevealed third seed loses offscreen in Round 3, and Mujinazaka and Itachiyama (which both boast a Top 3 Ace) lose in the quarterfinals</span>. Out of all the losses, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Inarizaki's loss to Karasuno is particularly surprising since they were runners-up at Interhigh, comprise a couple of top-tier members, and were one of the favourites to win the tournament; this shock victory is where everyone truly starts paying attention to Karasuno</span>. Karasuno, meanwhile, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">isn't able to play this trope straight to the very end, ending their surprise run at the quarterfinals in a three-set loss to the freakishly talented Kamomedai, and in a devastating fashion.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot">Vomit Discretion Shot</a>: Hinata often pukes from stress or motion sickness, but fortunately for the audience this is done off-screen (typically screams of despair from everyone present will follow).
