As the sole princess she is living a luxurious and carefree life as a princess should. She has it all: the finest clothes and cosmetics, the most divine sweets, a loving emperor as a father, and the hottest cousin crush, Soo-Won, anyone could ever hope to have. Now, if only her bodyguard and childhood friend, Son Hak, wasn't so annoying, her hair wasn't so red and curly and her father would allow her to marry Soo-Won, everything would be just perfect.</p><p>But on the day of her sixteenth birthday, her nearly perfect world shatters. The man she loves, Soo-Won, murders her father and the path to his ascension to the throne is assured. Framed for this, Hak escapes with Yona, and they retreat to his hometown Fuuga, the capital of the Wind Tribe. A man living near those lands, a priest called Ik-Soo, tells them of a prophecy related to her and the country's future. So Yona resolves to keep on living, to fight and survive by finding the Four Dragon Warriors, those who have inherited the mythical powers from their ancestors, who helped the legendary dragon king, Hiryuu, establish the Kouka Kingdom.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>An anime adaptation was produced for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fall2014Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fall2014Anime">Fall 2014 Anime</a> season by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioPierrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioPierrot">Studio Pierrot</a>, which was licensed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> for both streaming and home video, although Crunchyroll still possesses streaming rights as well.

Yona always saw him as a loving, if somewhat ditsy, father. Soo-Won believed him to be the murderer of Yu-Hon and unfit to be king. Several regular citizens regarded him as weak and a coward due to his pacifistic nature. Hak remained loyal to him even after death and knew that he was no coward (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after seeing him grab a sword blade with his bare hands to put a stop to needless violence</span>).</li><li> Similarly, Yu-Hon, Soo-Won's father and Il's older brother is another example. Within Kouka, he is generally seen as a war hero and a better candidate than Il to have been king. Geun-Tae harbours huge admiration for him, and Soo-won adored him as a child. However, Xing sees him as an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince">Evil Prince</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationStrike">killed their defenceless prisoners</a> during a brutal war of which Kouka was the victor</span>. The enmity is so bad, when Soo-Won rose to the throne seventeen years later, Princess Kouren started immediately preparing for war. Yona herself, after learning this, is aghast at her uncle's actions, and seems to believe that this is the reason why her grandfather passed him over as his successor in favor of her father.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">Amazon Chaser</a>: Hak is an unconventional example, as he's still stronger than Yona and he loved her long before she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, but he clearly takes pride in her badassery and finds her growing strength a major turn-on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>: This is done from time to time, usually to Jea-Ha who&#133; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">seems to enjoy it.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hak</span> does this in Chapter 152, only replace "anguished" with "angry" and you&#146;ve pretty much got the picture.

While the former hasn't moved on from his feelings for the latter, he appears to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">abandoned all hope of her ever returning them.</a> Now <em>he</em> appears to be the the one who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">and never seems to notice</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yona's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushBlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushBlush">Crush Blush</a> flaring up only around him</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>: Hak flies into one when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he sees Soo-Won close by for the first time since leaving the castle</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">Used to Be a Sweet Kid</a>: Soo-Won seems to genuinely have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">Keet</a> who was close to Yona and Hak in childhood. And then he kills the king and takes the throne.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>: The Nadai smugglers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnap Lili and Yona to use as slaves building their country's fort for the eventual war with the Water Tribe. They don't realize Lili isn't just some nobleman's daughter, but daughter of the very man they are preparing to fight, and Yona is, well, guarded by five men who will move heaven and earth for her safety</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a>: Li Hazara, Gobi and newcomer antagonist Ying Kuelbo team up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> capture Yona and the dragons so they can be used to takeover Kouka, and later, Imperial Kai.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>:<ul><li> Hak typically enjoys to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">The Gadfly</a> toward everyone, but Kija seems to be one of his favourite targets. He also refers to Kija exclusively as "White Snake."</li><li> Jae-Ha constantly teases Hak about his feelings for Yona, while Hak usually retaliates with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snark</a> or a swift punch. Hak also only ever refers to Jae-Ha as "Droopy Eyes."</li><li> In the end, when Hak flew into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> upon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seeing Soo-Won</span>, the two of them are the ones to stop him before he could get himself killed by the other side's guards. Furthermore, when Joo-Doh threatens Hak over the situation later on, they step in front of him protectively, both wearing a pretty fierce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>. For all their banter, it's clear that the three of them are actually good friends.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">Warrior Prince</a>:<ul><li> Yu-Hon, Il's late brother, whom Soo-Won saw as a noble and dignified general leading the army's forces. Su-Won worshiped his dad and aimed to follow in his footsteps.</li><li> Though a woman, Xing&#146;s crown princess, Kouren, falls into this trope. She is capable with both a sword and a bow, and she willingly places herself at the front lines more than once.</li><li> In <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeno&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a></span>, King Hiryuu was this as well.

As <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeno</span> explains in chapter 101, the succeeding generations of Hakuryuu warriors long to serve Hiryuu a bit too much, becoming something of an evil spirit. Instead of being possessed, Kija has accepted all of them and their desires making them actually repel lesser spirits and follow his orders. It helps that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father and predecessor seems to be keeping the others from getting out of hand</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNamedTheMonkeyJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNamedTheMonkeyJack">We Named the Monkey "Jack"</a>: Shin-Ah named his pet squirrel Ao, after his mentor and parental figure <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the previous Seiryuu</span>. This leads to an amusing gag in the manga where Yona asks Shin-Ah where he learned swordsmanship. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">He replies "Ao," prompting Yona to picture the squirrel holding a knife.</a> Shin-Ah thought the name didn&#146;t suit Pukyuu even before Yona brought it up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">We Used to Be Friends</a>: Hak, Yona, and Soo-Won were very close as kids. Obviously things went sour after Soo-Won's betrayal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> Starting from chapter two, this series has quite a few of them, beginning with Soo-Won&#146;s declarations that he killed King Il and then to Hak, saying that he could ask Yona since she witnessed it.</li><li> Kija&#146;s brief explanation about the origins of the huge scar on his back definitely qualifies.</li><li> "It is not my desire to sit upon the throne." From <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Soo-Won</strong> of all people.</span></li><li> "I am the previous King Il's child, Yona." It's the first time Yona admits this to someone outside of the Happy Hungry Bunch and she says this to <em>Kouren</em>, the crown princess of an enemy country who has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her friends held captive. That she was willing to spill the secret of her parentage shows just how desperate she is to keep Yoon and the Dragons safe</span>.</li><li> In chapter one hundred 41, "Now I understand why Uncle Yu-Hon could not become king." from Yona to Soo-Won, who adored and seemingly <em>still</em> adores his late father Yu-Hon. It's one of the first times <em>Yona</em> managed to shake and garner an emotional response from <em>Soo-Won</em> with only her words.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">Wham Shot</a>:<ul><li> The series has examples of this here and there, beginning with chapter one, when Yona sees her father get assassinated, and then again when she sees who the murderer is.</li><li> Much later, we have Zeno's hand reaching up to touch Yona's cheek after she's just seen him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stabbed through the heart</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes">What Beautiful Eyes!</a>: The Seiryuu's eyes are very beautiful to behold but his village is terrified of the Seiryuu's "curse" that anyone who looked upon those eyes would become paralyze and die (which wasn't entirely far away from the truth) so the Seiryuu always wore a mask to cover his eyes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude">What's Up, King Dude?</a>:<ul><li> Zeno towards <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Soo-Won</span>, to whom he addresses as "mister king guy." He has also taken to calling Yona "Little Miss". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The only royal he addresses as "your majesty" is Hiryuu</span>.</li><li> Jae-Ha addresses Yona very casually as "Yona-chan", which she doesn't mind. However, when he does the same with Vold and Princess Tao, Vold <em>does</em> mind.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">When She Smiles</a>: Hak is a rare male example; Yona finds his genuine smile to be irresistible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">Wholesome Crossdresser</a>: Yoon pretended to be a girl to sneak into a human trafficking ring along with Yona.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>: Kija is terrified of insects; when he hears Yona scream he asks whether it is due to ruffians or <em>bugs</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince">The Wise Prince</a>:<ul><li> Initially, Soo-Won appears to be this (and depending on how you interpret him, he may never have betrayed this).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">Worf Had the Flu</a>: Literally. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Dragons are all but defeated by Kai soldiers when they contract an illness due to leaving Kouka, which leaves them weak, feverish, and unsteady.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior">World's Best Warrior</a>: Hak is claimed to be the strongest soldier in the kingdom, having earned that title at a young age. It's to the point that he might actually be stronger than the Dragon Warriors themselves; he kept up with Kija when they took out some bandits with little to no issue despite being heavily injured at the time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When trying to kill Soo-Won, he easily brushes aside two foot soldiers <em>and</em> General Joo-Doh, and most likely would have killed Soo-Won had Jae-ha, Kija, and Yona not stopped him</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: Kum-Ji and his henchmen don't have a problem kicking or trying to kill Yona. Nor with stepping on Yoon's head, who was dressed as a girl at the time. Mizari also spares no qualms in his attempts to assasinate Princess Tao.<ul><li> The Sei soldiers at the fortresses mistreat everyone, be it a man or a woman.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst">Wrong Guy First</a>: Just about the most extreme example of this you could get. Yona spends <em>years</em> pining after Soo-Won, but on her sixteenth birthday, he murders her father, thereby proving himself to certainly be the wrong guy. In swoops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hak</a> to the rescue, and after a long break of emotional healing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yona begins her second love</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: Justified. The four dragons (with the strangest hair colours like white, blue, green, and yellow) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Yona</span> all have hair the same colour as the dragons they represent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleHairColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleHairColor">People like Soo-Won and Yoon</a> on the other hand... It is only outside of Kouka that green and blue hair are commented upon, hinting that the blood of the dragon&#146;s has something to do with this. Interestingly, Yona&#146;s hair is only commented on within Kouka.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">You Killed My Father</a>: Soo-Won kills King Il <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as revenge for his killing Soo-Won's father, Yu-Hon</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>: Hak has this a little bit, mostly because of his tall height and bulky build. It's easy to forget that he's actually two years younger than Kija and <em>seven years</em> younger than Jae-Ha, considering he both looks and acts as though they're peers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Your Approval Fills Me with Shame</a>: Mizari randomly cuts down soldiers on his own side. When Kouren demands he expain himself, he says that their soldiers are weak and useless, so it doesn't matter if they die here or in battle, especially since Kouren is about to start a war they have no hope of winning. Then he says that if they can't have the four dragons on their side, maybe he can get their powers and keep serving Kouren. Kouren looks appropriately horrified.<div class="indent"> Mizari: Everyone would die during the war... but lady Kouren would have the last laugh!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">Your Days Are Numbered</a>: When the new dragons are born <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingToBeReplaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingToBeReplaced">the predecessors slowly lose their powers and die.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It happened to Ao and to Kija's father, with Kija and Shin-Ah fully knowing what was going on</span>. The previous Ryokuryuu lived longer than normal, not dying until Jae-Ha was nearly a teenager, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he took his anger at his inevitable death out on Jae-Ha</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthfulFreckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthfulFreckles">Youthful Freckles</a>: Heang-Dea has some sprinkled across his nose and cheeks.</li></ul></div><hr>
