Scenes in the manga are often altered, moved around, or left out entirely in anime. This is especially prevalent in the first episode, where it simplified the first three chapters into a 22-minute runtime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The city where Beastars takes place is a literal example. While it was always portrayed as a big location in the manga, where hundreds of thousands animals could potentially live, some background glimpses from the anime imply it may be even bigger than that - when at one point Legosi and Haru visit a hilltop lookout point, the amount of buildings in the distance and the size of the visible bay area from the anime is multiple times bigger than what Itagaki originally drew.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> behind the murder of Tem that kickstarts the story invokes a particularly chilling fear: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if someone ever decided to skip their prescribed medication out of a misplaced sense of self-confidence (a rationale Tem's killer possessed), they might commit a psychosis-induced murder</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: Zigzagged. While there are certainly irresponsible adults from time to time (higher echelons of the law are shown to be spineless idiots who cower in fear of the Sublime Beastar), most other adults are portrayed to be fairly well-adjusted, professional and even <em>sensible</em> people who, while well-meaning, are either barred from helping others or are bound too tightly by the red tape of bureaucracy (the headmaster of Cherryton acknowledging these problems coming from the opinions of differing species). The cops during the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riz arc</span>, the carnivore dorm supervisor and even the drama club leader are also perfect examples.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: There are a great variety of names in this world. There are normal real-world names like Louis, Bill, Jack and Haru, as well as names that are more out there like Legosi, Tem, and Els.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon">All-CGI Cartoon</a>: The anime (which is produced by Orange, the same studio behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LandOfTheLustrous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LandOfTheLustrous">Land of the Lustrous</a></em>) is primarily animated in CGI with some 2D effects.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a>: Played for laughs. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Legosi and Haru return to the school dorms after being AWOL the whole night following their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc">Rescue Arc</a>, several of his male classmates think they ran off to be lovey-dovey alone. So when Legosi goes to a carnivore meet-up sometime later, one of the first questions they collectively ask him is "Can large carnivores have sex with bunnies". He is not amused.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">All Part of the Show</a>: During the second performance of Adler <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legosi savagely attacks Bill</span> and the audience is unsure whether or not it is part of the show until Louis appears to convince them that it was.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>: Mizuchi, the jilted girl bully who torments Haru.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a>: This quickly becomes one of the story's central themes, as almost every major character with enough screentime is revealed to be plagued with self-doubt and varying levels of inferiority complex towards individual animals, whole food chain branches or even their whole environment. Legosi, Haru, Louis, Juno, Bill, Jack, and many others all have to deal with these demons, but for some of them the need to overcome these feelings helps them grow and gradually become stronger, better people. For some, the old insecurities are just replaced by a brand new set.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>: Due to the difference in strength between carnivores and herbivores, it's not uncommon to hear stories about former dismembering the latter by accident, and all hospitals are required to have a transplant ward for such situations. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And we learn of this when Tao the puma accidentally rips Kibi the anteater's arm off while simply goofing off with him. Neither of them takes it well.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haru introduced a variant when she told Legosi she loves him back in chapter 83; in her own estimation she messed up the confession before she even finished that breath. All because with Legosi being her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Living Emotional Crutch</a>, she revealed her other emotions consuming her at the time to him at once and admitted her increasing concern for her ex-lover Louis, which in her own words was directly linked with her growing love for Legosi and her re-surfacing inferiority complex. All things considered, Legosi took it much better than she thought and, instead of making a fuss about Louis, promised to do everything he can to keep her happy.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalBattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalBattleAura">Animal Battle Aura</a>: Kyuu, who is a small rabbit, uses a fighting style where one simulates an imaginary self is a hybrid of themself and a different species that compensates for the traits that the user lacks. Kyuu's aura when using this style is a half panda, who is much larger than she is. When Legosi tries learning this style his aura appears as what a possible future half rabbit son of his and Haru's might look like.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes">Animal Stereotypes</a>: Characters fit into some stereotypes while avoiding others. The wolf is a loner, but he's not normally fierce or violent. The rabbit does love sex, but she's no timid pushover and actually hates being seen as weak just because she's a rabbit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>: Completely averted in this setting. If you're doing something unusual, someone will always notice and all you really have to do is raise your voice to turn at least a few heads your way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol">Arc Symbol</a>: Hands. Specifically Legosi's hands with the big claws, which are a constant reminder of his carnivore status.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArentYouGoingToRavishMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArentYouGoingToRavishMe">Aren't You Going to Ravish Me?</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haru is pretty much used to guys coming to her only for sex, so she is completely baffled when it turns out that Legosi, visiting her garden on his club's errand, not only doesn't want to sleep with her as his reward for helping her a bit but is also absolutely terrified of the idea and runs away as soon as he figures out her intentions. This was such a big change of routine for her that she actually thanked him later for being realistic about the whole incident.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>: As the manga progresses, readers will notice how Paru Itagaki's art develops over time. Originally she commonly used clean simple drawings in slow sections at the start of the manga, building up to highly-detailed drawings in action and dramatic scenes; which soon developed into her using more detailed drawings consistently in the slow paces and creating even more vivid drawings in her action and dramatic scenes</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: While the anime is produced largely in CGI, there are some occasional shifts in art or even medium.<ul><li> The first season's opening, "Wild Side", is done entirely in stop-motion.</li><li> In Episode 7, Haru's dream sequence is done entirely with traditional hand-drawn animation, and with a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a> to boot, courtesy of animator Yoko Kuno.</li><li> Louis' backstory is also animated traditionally, with the art being closer to a storybook style.</li><li> Multiple comedic moments also feature brief points of two-dimensional animation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a>: The Drama Club has become much less important throughout the series. The first arc was about a play the club was putting on and the tension between Legosi and Bill. But since then there hasn't been that much focus on it at all as Legosi has gained other concerns and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis left the club (and school in general)</span>. It is still a regular fixture in the story, but usually just as just a place for other plot things to occur.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>: All over the place, but a lot of it is just exaggerations of real life.<ul><li> There is a plot point that Legosi seems to dislike his grandfather due to the fact he isn't a wolf, and Legosi and his mother are half breed wolves (quarter in Legosi's case rather.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out his grandfather is a <em>komodo dragon</em>. Ignoring the impossibility of a mammal and a reptile having children, Legosi looks like he has only inherited a few reptilian traits from his grandfather: small pupils and immunity to komodo dragon poison.</span><ul><li> And it eventually comes out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legosi's mother developed scales similar to her father later in life that was the contributing factor to her suicide</span>.</li></ul></li><li> As revealed in Chapter 124, Legosi isn't the only halfbreed in the series with the introduction of another hybrid character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">called Melon. A serial killing Leopard-Gazelle hybrid, who is forced to hide his heritage</span>.<ul><li> This was even hammered home further with the introduction of the hybrid Daycare in Chapter 142.</li></ul></li><li> This series also gets several other things wrong about biology although some of them may be intentional. For example, it greatly exaggerates the deadliness of Komodo dragon venom. In real life they are not a very venomous species, but the series depicts Gosha has having to be extremely careful not to accidentally poison people and dripping large amounts of venom from his mouth when excited, and when he is especially upset his venom acts like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid">Hollywood Acid</a>. It also gets where they secrete the venom from wrong. In real life Komodo dragons secrete venom from a pair of sacks in their lower jaw, not from the upper jaw like Gosha does.</li><li> The series also states that herbivores cannot digest meat. This actually isn't true in real life. Many animals that are labeled as herbivores in real life are not actually strict vegetarians and will occasionally eat meat to get nutrients that plants are low in.</li><li> In Chapter 154, some of the history of this civilization is revealed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apparently when the carnivores or "life animals" first encountered the herbivores or "nature animals", some form of magical "survival instinct" triggered causing the carnivores to view the herbivores as objects of protection, rather than potential meals even though the historical account just established that the carnivores would eat each other to survive.</span> It remains to be seen how much of this account is factual versus mythical versus revisionist history but, needless to say, the current story flies in the face of established predator/prey behavior observed in nature.</li><li> Towards the climax of the Melon arc, some traits ascribed to some species cross the line from exaggerated to purely fantastic. Apparently, a few drops of venom from a strong komodo dragon is enough to melt a huge hole through a building wall in a matter of seconds; they can also bristle their scales like a mammal would bristle their fur. Leopard spots move on their bodies based on their thoughts or emotions.

His clawed hands are always there to remind him of his nature as a carnivore and he always tries to hide his sharp teeth.

On the other hand, the first Shishigumi Boss of the Meteor Festival Arc is truly evil&mdash; he actually kidnaps, kills, and eats herbivores, is in bed with the city mayor so he turns a blind eye to his business, plans to harm both Haru and Legosi, and is much older than Bill.</li><li> Whereas both Bill and the first Shishigumi Boss are relatively simple and straightforward characters, with the latter being particularly flat and unsympathetic, Tem's killer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riz</span> from the Murder Incident Solution Arc, is a villain who gets a lot of screentime dedicated to what led him to kill and is given more sympathy than expected with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>.

Where the three of them mostly planned on a small scale and had only self-interest at the plots they were a part in, Melon wants to destroy carnivore/herbivore relationships to make money off of the frenzied carnivores.

Similar things happen in multiple instances with multiple characters.<ul><li> For carnivores, the ability to kill is seen as a sort of rite of passage not unlike losing virginity. Legosi tries to understand Tem's killer's perspective, even noting that he "has something he doesn't", by starting small and eating a larvae raw; and afterward, he shows textbook examples of a freshly non-virgin male (he's in pure bliss following the consumption, his fur grows back, he gets more confident).</li><li> Even strip joints run on this sort of logic.

Carnivores are overwhelmingly strong so all it takes is a lapse of focus for them to do real harm. It's not uncommon for them to accidentally rip an herbivore's limb off! Though thankfully, reattachment surgeries are very accessible and have high success rates.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>: The act of eating meat and predatory nature is constantly tied with sexuality within the story.

Aside from her constant bullying issues and first, nearly fatal encounter with Legosi that kicked off part of the plot, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she also was abducted and nearly devoured by the first leader of the Shishigumi gang, and recently was designated by Melon the killer hybrid as the one herbivore he too wants to eat.

It is later revealed that after committing herself to live as a true, beautiful wolf to fit in with society, she began developing scales similar to her father. Upon this, she set out to have a child that was more wolf than herself and by the time she killed herself, her back was covered in scales. What seems to have pushed her over was Legosi still inheriting traits, such as his expressions, from his grandfather that made her actually kill herself.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Driving Question</a>: A more open-ended example than most, but one nonetheless- are herbivores and carnivores actually incompatible with each other not only in terms of societal equality, but in their capability to enter a romantic relationship? Just about every major character in the story grapples with this question, from Legosi and Haru with their interspecies relationship, to more minor cases like Bill and Aoba's struggle with their predatory nature. This becomes an even bigger problem later on, as Legosi encounter the ivory trader Melon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is a predator-prey hybrid.

In reality, Legosi is using the meat as training to <em>suppress</em> his carnivore urges, spending hours at a time sitting a room with slabs of meat to dull his senses and desire for it. After completing this training, he buries all the meat with headstones that have their names (he took the time to find out the name of every corpse he bought).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneKnewAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneKnewAlready">Everyone Knew Already</a>: This is Louis's reaction when Legosi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">comes out to him as an herbivore fetishist</a>.<div class="indent"><strong>Louis:</strong> Seriously?

It ends with the scene where he meets Haru on the rooftop.</li><li> "Sleeping Instinct", on the other hand, is very menacing, having bombastic rock music, tinted red, showing Legosi struggling with his feral instincts. It ends with the scene where he's about to attack Haru near the fountain.</li><li> "Marble" is much more melancholic, tinted yellow, showing Legosi's thoughts on his relationships, and the relations between herbivores and carnivores.

Almost instinctively, the carnivores of the Drama Club gather together the herbivores and surround them, keeping them safe. This seems to go against every convention established thus far about carnivore-herbivore relations, though at the time it's explained to be a natural reaction thanks to the recent kills. Over 120 chapters later, it's revealed through Jack that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> carnivores have an instinctual desire to protect herbivores that goes back to an almost prehistoric era.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyDressedCartoonAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyDressedCartoonAnimal">Fully Dressed Cartoon Animal</a>: Applies to majority of the central cast of characters in the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Event</a>: Every single time Haru and Legosi discuss their relationship or show each other affection in public places, every animal that can see or hear them is instantly drawn to them with perked ears, and mouth and eyes wide open, sometimes almost hanging over them to absorb all of the exciting and interesting bits. Legosi begins to notice and is not amused, though this is justified seeing how just about everything about these two interacting is unique and odd against the in-story social norms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder">Furry Reminder</a>: Along with the usual talk about carnivores and herbivores, there's also a number of animal-related activities for each species to partake in. Alongside Bio-Week at the school (where students get to spend time in their natural habitat such as lizards in a humid environment, polar bears in a very cold room, and wolves looking at a fake moon), canines are able to go to a facility that has a ball-tossing machine and are also pre-disposed to chasing balls and ball-like objects.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a>: Mizuchi the harlequin rabbit and her two friends.

Worried that predators might latch onto the story to justify eating others, the police edit the story that is released to the public so it is simply that Louis was the one who learned Riz was the killer and dropped out of school to investigate it before confronting him on New Years and getting his foot eaten by Riz.

Previously, even the most despicable people were understandable and sympathetic, to a degree. This guy? You&#146;d have to look <em>very carefully</em> to find someone who at the very least is indifferent. Characters themselves note that there's something off-putting about him even before they have a real conversation with him, and once he speaks his mind, he manages to incite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gosha</span> into a murderous rage.

A single drop of it turns the soup it landed in purple, then eats right through the bowl and the table, and then through several floors, then all the way into an underground tunnel, and through a water pipe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHousing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHousing">Horrible Housing</a>: The Hidden Condo is an old apartment complex in a very noisy area within walking distance of the Black Market.

There's even a purebreed supremacist who targets half-breeds. Interspecies marriage only became legal recently, but government still pays same species couples to have children to encourage people to breed with their own species. And here are laws that restrict what species are allowed to marry, although those laws may actually be partly for safety reasons rather than discrimination, such as it being illegal for a carnivore convicted of a predatory offense to marry an herbivore.<ul><li> Legosi's mother kept the fact that she was a hybrid a secret and pretended to be a normal pure bred wolf. But when signs of her mixed heritage started to show through, she quickly got herself pregnant due to the fear that nobody would want to mate with her if they could see she was a hybrid and would never be able to have a child. As the signs of her hybrid status got more visible she stopped leaving her room for fear of being seen before she eventually killed herself.</li><li> Melon, who was visibly a hybrid as a child, was bullied by other children for being a hybrid, and this contributed to him becoming a psychopath. As an adult he hides his nose and mouth with a surgical mask when he is hiding his evil nature so that people will think he is only a normal gazelle.

Haru's slowly coming to the realization that entering a carnivore-herbivore romantic relationship is very dangerous, if not suicidal, for the latter, and as a result for a time thinks of completely severing her ties with Legosi before it's too late. But then she also admits that even with that in mind, he means too much to her to give up on him so easily; and after hearing what he's been through recently, she decides she definitely wants to try romancing him properly.

Once he has her cornered and everything indicates he's about to eat her, the scene changes its tone completely (including night becoming sunny day) and Haru and Legosi become entranced with one another, quickly joining in a happy dance.

This indicates to viewers both Legosi's struggle to have a happy relationship with Haru versus what his carnivore instincts can pull on him if he's careless, but also how carnivores might perceive the act of killing and devouring prey in their minds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Which, to a certain degree, was exactly what Riz went through when he murdered Tem.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImminentDangerClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImminentDangerClue">Imminent Danger Clue</a>: Legosi is sent by the drama club to arrange some flower decoration with the gardening club as part of preparations for their play.

When he's resting in the school library with his head between his arms, he picks up her scent right next to him.

When Legosi and his friends first stumble into the back alley market the first animal they meet is a guy who is selling his own fingers and has a price tag hanging from each finger. Sometimes even carnivores will do this because carnivore meat supposedly has medicinal properties. At one point when Louis the deer has to go to the back alley market alone, he wears a huge price tag on his back to keep any carnivores from bothering him.

Her first love <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis</span> frankly tells her they can never be an official couple and being friends with benefits is the best they can (covertly) do together.

She can't decide which role she wants more, as long he's simply by her side, which also means she's having difficulties deciding which angle to emphasize when talking to him. It doesn't help that due to how emotionally dependent on him she becomes later on, she can be moody and send him contradicting signals within the same conversation if he deprives her of his presence for too long.

Seeing how he already made a name for himself by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving a herbivore from certain death</span>, they think this will be a great milestone for his reputation, and while Legosi isn't interested in pursuing the title at all (and isn't even aware that he's being groomed for it), telling him he can prevent further herbivore deaths is a suitable motivation in itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">My Girl Is Not a Slut</a>: Played with.

They allow them to eat meat for protein as fish and bugs did not evolve into sapience and the city was founded by a joint decision of the evolved predators and prey. Also there is no evidence in the film that predators are struggling to contain their base instincts and it takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">Psycho Serum</a> to bring out their savage side. In <em>Beastars</em>, different species really do have different urges, with predators having to learn to control their predatory urges or otherwise indulge in them on the down-low. It's a society where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore">Vegetarian Carnivore</a> trope is enforced, prey animals have a constant awareness that they could be eaten and it's unclear why these evolved predator and prey would choose to live in close contact with each other under these conditions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StacysMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StacysMom">Stacy's Mom</a>: Played with. A 12-year-old Jack thought that Legosi's mother was very pretty, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but that that impression was based on her funeral portrait displayed during her wake.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithoutACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithoutACrush">Stalker Without a Crush</a>:<ul><li> The school's security guard started following Legosi after becoming intrigued with how...unusual he is. Notably, he actually realizes he's being followed for about a week, and actively asks his stalker to show themselves before everyone thinks he's crazy (he had mentioned that he had been hearing weird noises to his roommates, which just creeped them out.)</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And now that Legosi is an ex-convict who actually committed a crime to stop another criminal, he's also under the watch of the police who are really curious what he will do next.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>: Legosi and Haru, though it takes a bit before Haru truly returns Legosi's affections. The idea of a carnivore and an herbivore, especially of such different sizes, getting together is socially pretty looked down on, though not illegal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, Legosi does get legally banned from marrying any herbivores due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">getting arrested for eating Louis's foot.</a> </span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage">Starfish Language</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pun notwithstanding, it's revealed at one point that sea creatures are also sapient in this setting, complete with their own societies and a unique belief system revolving around a "circle of life" despite being non-anthropomorphic. However, they don't speak anything resembling a language. Instead, they communicate using small streams of bubbles in different elaborate patterns that can be translated into specific phrases and words.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopMotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopMotion">Stop Motion</a>: The anime's opening is animated in stop motion, as opposed to the rest of the series being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon">entirely in CGI</a> with some 2D effects blended in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Legosi eats Louis' foot to turn the tide during his duel with Riz, he returns to the fight visibly bulked up and reinvigorated, which the narration describes as him entering "Super Beast Mode".</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a>:<ul><li> At least two herbivores taunted Legosi into biting or eating them on separate occasions, complete with putting their hands into his mouth, either for their own amusement or to prove their superiority. They were lucky they tried this with Legosi; carnivores such as Bill would most likely accept their invitation.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Riz the bear began to feel so comfortable, happy, and at peace with himself while chatting with Tem that he decided to stop taking the medication all bears are required to use to control their vast strength. This would turn out to have disastrous effects for both of them.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears">Tender Tears</a>: Haru is prone to this whenever her emotions pile up. Also, sometimes Legosi and Juno.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">These Are Things Man Was Not Meant to Know</a>: While both carnivores and herbivores are given a general knowledge of the war between the two groups, only those with high marks are given a full scope of said history. We don't know the true nature of this history, but apparently it's shown to have a negative effect on those who learn it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">From what Jack explains in Chapter 154, one thing about it was the war was taken far more seriously by the herbivores rather than the carnivores and a blue whale appeared and stopped the war.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>: Happens in chapter 158, when Legosi asks Louis to help him capture Melon and become the Beastars together. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Louis promptly laughs at how dumb and forced the title Beastar sounds pluralized.</a> This occurs again in chapter 190 when it's revealed that Legosi named the team he represents (which is basically just him and Louis) "Beastars".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transplant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transplant">Transplant</a>: Legosi and Haru have been characters Itagaki has drawn for years; the first comic she ever made was about them, and Legosi has made appearances in the animal manga she made before <em>Beastars</em>, <em>Beast Complex</em>. It's only now that they're fully fleshed out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>:<ul><li> Legosi and his canine roommates at the Cherryton dorms are tightly-knit group of friends and a true pack. While Jack tends to get the most spotlight out of all of them due to his longer record with Legosi, all of them really enjoy each other's company and like to spend time together <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even after Legosi drops out of school, making sure to visit him regularly and spend quality time with him when possible</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Louis quickly developed such rapport with the Shishigumi gang after he became their new boss. They may be morally-questionable gangsters, but they still treat him like a genuine member of a loving family and were crucial in making him slowly change his attitude towards carnivores, something especially visible in his later interactions with Legosi and Juno.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Legosi, Haru, Louis and Juno are gradually becoming one more group like this. Despite their sometimes rocky beginnings of individual interactions, they are currently all on very good terms and both enjoy each others' company and are willing to assist one another as much as they can when needed. Suffice to say, currently each one of them is in love with one other member of the group (or slowly getting there) and treats the others as reliable friends, up to the point where they can talk about their love problems with them.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalFinalMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalFinalMessage">Unintentional Final Message</a>: The story opens with Legosi trying to give Els the love confession that Tem wrote but was too shy to send. Els is grateful for the letter, and Legosi's efforts end up helping to change her biases against carnivores.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore">Vegetarian Carnivore</a>: Since meat is illegal in this society (as all animals except for insects are sapient), carnivores normally eat plant or dairy-based protein. Chickens are paid for their unfertilized eggs and supposedly cows get a deal for their milk to be sold as food.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot">Vomit Discretion Shot</a>: Played with. In chapter 143, Louis vomits while trying to have sex with his fiancee. While the act of him vomiting is on full display, both his mouth and the vomit coming out of it are heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pixellation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pixellation">pixellated</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyMarriageProposal">Wacky Marriage Proposal</a>: Wacky in how completely out of nowhere it came for the target. When Legosi's and Haru's bond hits its so-far rock-bottom due to the former purposefully ignoring the latter during his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">anti-carnivore physical training with Gouhin,</span> she finally managed to force him into a conversation and explaining why he abandoned her. However, her strained emotional state combined with his usual poor communication skills made him feel like she was about to cut their ties for good, so in a desperate move, he asked if she would marry him after they both graduate. This seemingly backfired at first as she furiously stormed off moments later, but might also have become a trigger for them to start mending their bond little by little.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe">We Hardly Knew Ye</a>: Many minor characters get the non-lethal version of this: they get introduced in a new chapter that seemingly focuses on them, only to reveal that their main purpose was additional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> or introducing a new part of the setting where the main characters are about to do something, and they never get mentioned again. Probably the most notable example so far is Cosmo, a herbivore stripper from the Backalley Market <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> whose main meta-goal was showing the progress of Louis' integration into the Shishigumi and his resulting influence on the Market</span>. After her first two chapters, she completely vanishes from the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?" Epilogue</a>: The final chapter includes snippets of what happened to the major characters of the story. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis is now the Horns CEO and is making the best out of a bad situation with his relationship with Azuki, The Shishigumi is working to try to reduce their sentence so they can go back to Louis, who intends to hire them, Gouhin was hired by a normal psychiatric clinic after the closing of the Back-Alley Market, Cherryton has ended their segregation after Louis' speech, the 701 canines are graduating, with Jack going to a particular highly-regarded college to change the way dogs work in society, and Haru and Legosi start dating.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>: The main drive of the story once Legosi meets Haru, with a heavy emphasis on analyzing the internal and external factors that contribute to the direction in which their relationship evolves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">World of Funny Animals</a>: This world is populated entirely by anthropomorphic animals. There's a particular focus on the tension between carnivorous and herbivorous animals, and how that would impact this kind of society.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legosi and Kyuu resolve to fight Melon on the last Meat Loving Day of the year, which is said to be on Friday, December 25th. However, in an earlier chapter, Legosi got a tattoo of the current date, "July 5, Wednesday". In a calendar year where July 5th is on Wednesday, the last Friday in December is the 30th.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongNameOutburst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongNameOutburst">Wrong Name Outburst</a>: Haru shouts to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Louis</span> when Legosi finds her in the dark. Oops.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>:<ul><li> Several characters tell this Legosi quite early in the manga after properly interacting with him. In fact, the first one to do so was a herbivore.</li><li> Most people despise Haru due to her sexual activities, and her past makes her feel worthless at times, but Legosi makes it clear (when he actually gathers enough guts to talk to her straight) that he holds her in high regard and spends time with her because she is important to him.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out Haru thinks the same of him. Sometime after meeting him, she figures out he's the one who attacked her at the beginning of the story, but she didn't reject him because at that point she already truly appreciated his presence in her life, even when she acknowledged all of his quirks and oddities (and also because she wasn't particularly opposed to the idea of getting eaten at the time).</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">You Are Not Alone</a>:<ul><li> One of Haru's biggest fears is that she will always be friendless and will never experience true, mutual love. Legosi's increasing presence in her life may give her hope of invoking this trope.</li><li> Legosi is really bummed out that some of his classmates don't mind indulging in their carnivorous instincts once in a while as they think it's only natural and in their minds Legosi is the freak for restraining himself. Then Aoba the bald eagle, with whom Legosi rarely interacts, admits that he shares the wolf's beliefs, as one time he potentially could have a go at eating meat, he thought of all his herbivore friends and refused. Legosi is so moved by the confession that he starts crying on the spot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">You Are Too Late</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> While Pina did a great job by bringing police to the fight between Riz and Legosi once he un-hostaged himself, had he arrived just minutes earlier, chances are Legosi wouldn't have been forced to commit a serious offence to defeat the bear, and doing that caused him a lot of long-term trouble almost instantly.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureNotMyType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureNotMyType">You're Not My Type</a>: Mizuchi the harlequin rabbit's boyfriend admits he's actually very unhappy in his relationship and would rather be with someone like Haru (minus sleep-around tendencies); the only reason he doesn't break up with Mizuchi is their species' endangered status that she most likely constantly guilt-trips him about.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">You Mean "Xmas"</a>: Rather than Christmas, there's Rexmas, which celebrates the resurrection of a T-rex after the meteor impact that had seemingly killed all the dinosaurs.</li></ul></div><hr>
