Originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a>, Nanamine read Mashiro and Takagi's "Money and Intelligence", intended to be a dark, cynical dystopian piece, and had the epiphany that he could just <em>buy</em> friends and accomplish basically anything he wanted through riches and being manipulative.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sheesh Nakai, you get your first taste of a girl liking you and you act like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">you're better than everyone.</a> </span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalEarlyAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalEarlyAppearance">Adaptational Early Appearance</a>: A few in the anime. Koogy is mentioned a few times before he makes his debut as a mangaka, Kaya appears in the first episode, and Hiramaru overhears a conversation between Mashiro and Takagi about being a mangaka before picking up an issue of Jump and getting the inspiration to become a mangaka.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: The <em>Bakuman</em> anime removes much of the droning banter of the manga in the process of paper-to-animation, giving the show a much more breezy and fast-paced style (examples include Akito's explanation of what makes Miho smart and both Mashiro and Akito dissecting what they like and don't like about manga).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The anime adds and rearranges scenes to fill time and add extra dimension and depth to both characters and plot details, giving it a unique feel that's separate from the manga. In addition, the one-shots ideas that appear in the manga like "Two Earths" are expanded to become full stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgreeToDisagree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgreeToDisagree">Agree to Disagree</a>: Mashiro and Takagi, regarding whether older artists should make a comeback; Mashiro thinks so, while Takagi believes that they would take spots from younger artists. They both decide to drop the argument, realizing that arguing about it won't get them anywhere, and this may be in part because Takagi realizes how personal this issue is to Mashiro, whose uncle wanted to re-establish himself in Jump.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a>: Azuki's mother's opinion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: Data such as characters' birthdates, birthplaces, height and weight, as well as some background characters' names (such as Fukuda's second assistant, Nonaka, whose name is never mentioned throughout the series), are only available in supplemental material.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading">Alternate Character Reading</a>: The main characters are Moritaka and Akito, but they call each other Saiko and Shujin, which are alternate ways to pronounce their respective names. Takagi's friends call him "Shuuto," a name similarly derived from his given name. Moritaka considers his to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Embarrassing Nickname</a>.<ul><li> The word "shujin" can also be translated as "husband", with "saiko" also being able to be translated as "extremely cheerful". Could also be read as to how close Mashiro and Takagi are.</li><li> At first, Takagi reacts weirdly to being called "Shuujin", as it also means <em>prisoner</em> (he even asks Mashiro, "are you calling me a bandit?!"), but he takes it in stride pretty fast.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysInClassOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysInClassOne">Always in Class One</a>: In high school, they were shown to be in class 1-1.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">Analogy Backfire</a>: After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being hospitalized from overworking and malnutrition</span>, Mashiro <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">refuses to go on hiatus or stop drawing.</span> He then makes the comparison to feeling like Joe Yabuki (from Ashita no Joe) heading for his final round in the ring.<ul><li> Considering that he had resolved to "risk his life for manga", after his father reminds him of his liking the series, and thought that Joe Yabuki died in an admirable way, it's entirely possible he was completely aware of what he was saying.</li><li> Fukuda once calls himself the "Romeo of Hiroshima" when saying that he should know more about romance than the people who placed ahead of him with their romance one-shots. Then again, the winner, Aoki, had never been on a date, perhaps making it a moot point.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a>: <span style="display:none">invoked</span>The main criticism about Moriya's stories - They're genuinely good ideas, but they're too preachy for Shonen manga according to the editors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>: It's amazing how much more sketchy and cartoony the characters become over time. This doesn't detract from the story, though; somehow, it makes the whole thing more lively. It is possible that the art style of the manga is meant to reflect the genre of the manga that the protagonists are working on at the time.<ul><li> In universe example: Mashiro is a pretty good artist starting out, but there's always room for improvement and as the story progresses, Mashiro learns the dos and don'ts of drawing manga in addition to modifying his art style several times either because of an editor critiquing it or to help keep his and Takagi's series on par with that of the brilliant Eiji Nizuma.<ul><li> Heck, Mashiro even learns how to draw faster courtesy of one of his and Takagi's assisants. Shiratori in Chapter 105 does a basic sketch in front of Mashiro of one of the protagonists in PCP and according to him, a basic sketch is all he bothers doing before inking and wouldn't you know it, that's just the technique Mashiro needs to get faster at drawing if he's to get on Eiji's level!</li><li> To do this he finds he must use less screen tones... a few pages after this revelation this page makes it obvious what too much screen tone can do <a class="urllink" href="http://www.batoto.net/read/_/21398/bakuman_ch95_by_sleepyfans/2">The dots are screen tones <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.batoto.net/read/_/21398/bakuman_ch95_by_sleepyfans/4">This too<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.batoto.net/read/_/21398/bakuman_ch95_by_sleepyfans/7">And this...and more...<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> Several changes in character design as well. Aoki's breasts keep getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">bigger and bigger</a>, and Nakai gets even fatter as the series progresses.<ul><li> The manga spans several years. That might explain the case of Nakai's weight. Aoki, not so much.</li><li> Compare Eiji's first appearance with how he looks now. He seems to look younger now.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: Used often during gags and other moments.<ul><li> Ultimate example: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangapanda.com/bakuman/119/9">"Variant" "Proper" Battle Manga!!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepInClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepInClass">Asleep in Class</a>: Mashiro falls asleep in class after doing several all-nighters in a row to get a story drawn. Notably, he does this deliberately, rather than accidentally nodding off.<ul><li> On one occasion, Mashiro unintentionally falls asleep in class during a test after spending much of the previous night practicing with a pen, much to his embarrassment. He suggests that he was almost sleepy enough to take the test with the same pen he uses to draw manga.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>: Considering that this is a story about an artist/writer duo trying to make it in the manga industry written by an artist/writer duo with some pretty strong opinions about the industry, it's not too surprising that Ashirogi Muto wind up being the the voice for Ohba and Obata's views some of the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a>: Part of his usual attire when heading home for the day, but also how Heishi emphasizes his authority <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after being promoted to Chief Editor</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>: Hattori devises a cunning plan to both raise Jump's sales and improve the work of several mangaka. The whole thing hinges on making Eiji the first artist to have two series running at the same time in Jump, which creates/intensifies rivalries between several characters.
