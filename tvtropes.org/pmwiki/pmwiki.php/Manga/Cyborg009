The general setting is also updated to take place in the modern day, although the historical settings of the first four cyborgs' backstories are retained by having them be cryogenically frozen for decades afterward and them being marked as the "first generation" of the 00 project. The anime also gives the Mythos arc more of an actual conclusion, as the manga equivalent of the arc wrapped up <em>very</em> abruptly due to the series being dropped from Weekly Shonen King.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">Adaptation Dye-Job</a>: For some reason, most characters are prone to change hair and uniform color with every new adaptation of the series ('specially Joe's hair <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24eoo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24eoo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24eoo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is black in the '60s Toei animated works, dirty blond in the '79 series, brown in "Legend of the Super Galaxy" and the 2001 series, and ginger in <em>009 RE: Cyborg</em></span>).<ul><li> The Pu'Awak sisters are blonde in Ishinomori's colored artwork, but red-haired in the 2001 anime. The Mythos cyborg Helena was also originally a blonde in the manga, but had her hair color and the very style altered along with her name (see "Adaptation Name Change").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The cyborgs' time at Dr. Kozumi's house is elaborated on a little more in the early episodes of the '01 series. 0012 was also given a backstory and identity, while in the manga she was only witnessed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainInAJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainInAJar">Brain in a Jar</a> and never had any indication of what she was before.<ul><li> In the manga, 0011 went after the 00-Cyborgs in exchange for a human body if he kills them. The 2001 anime gives a specific reason why: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was a married man, who one day was wrenched from his wife and daughter by Black Ghost and turned into a cyborg assassin. He went after the 00-Cyborgs because he was promised he would be made human again and allowed to go back to his family if he succeeded. </span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">Adaptation Name Change</a>: Helena of the Mythos cyborgs became "Artemis" in the 2001 series, and also received a design overhaul to distinguish her from the similar Helen (of the Pu'Awak sisters).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationPersonalityChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationPersonalityChange">Adaptation Personality Change</a>: See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a> for more details.

On top of that, the surviving Cyborgs have lost their home and the Dolphin, they failed to save anyone in the Underground Empire before Black Ghost nuked it and 004 had to watch a woman he loved die in his arms for the second time in his life</span>. However, in the case of the manga, this was averted by a fan outcry which led to Ishinomori resuming the story and throwing in a retcon.<ul><li> "Conclusion: God's War" also has this, at least in the manga (as the anime version cut off on a cliffhanger): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> All the cyborgs have died, but get to exist on an alternate, peace-filled copy of Earth known as "the world of light", where they're reborn as humans and get to enjoy happier lives. The vague nature of the ending has been debated over its bittersweetness as well, as there are implications that they're not so much "alive" as much as that they're now existing as purified spirits.</span></li><li> The "Call of Justice" anime has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cyborgs defeating the Blessed, but 004 and 009 were lost to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> (Heinrich staying behind on a space station being launched into the sun to prevent Emperor from launching its omnicidal payload, and 009 accelerating past the point of no return to trap Emperor there as well), and the entire incident they prevented being covered up with the authorities, leaving the survivors with no thanks for their actions beyond their being falsely labelled as terrorists being quietly revoked.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed with Suck</a>: The Psychic Assassins can't overexert on their powers, otherwise their bodies age rapidly.

Self-admitted, too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerise</a>: While regarded as the adaptation that sticks closest to the early manga, the 2001 anime underwent this in some instances:<ul><li> Jet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">Accidental Murder</a> in his backstory was eliminated in the 2001 anime, with him only about to get into a gang fight before the cops come and he winds up on the run for his delinquency. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">Accidental Murder</a> incident was kept in the Archaia comics and the <em>Call of Justice</em> mini-series.</li><li> "Man or Machine?" has a key plot moment toned down and changed up a little to allot for the younger audience; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the manga, the fake 004 stomps on a nest of owlets and then murders the mother, in an attempt to hide from Albert and not have any noise to alert him to his location. Albert finds the duplicate anyway, and manages to finish him off. In the anime, the owl nest is disturbed and winds up falling, but Albert manages to catch it and the robot becomes confused due to being unable to predict that movement. Albert is then able to finish his duplicate off.</span></li><li> Ivan's backstory in the manga depicts his father as beating his mother to death over her protests about what he's about to do to the baby. This did not make the transition either, with Erika surviving and simply being locked out of Gamo's science lab as he started the experiments despite her pleas (although she may have died in the proceeding decades).</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of episode 47, the deaths of the Pu'Awak sisters were relegated to an off-screen moment, with their screams being heard as Von Bogoot shot them. It's followed by a shot of Viina weakly calling out for Albert, who winds up screaming her name. In the manga? Readers get to see a spread of Von Bogoot shooting all five sisters at once, all experiencing a <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">Family-Unfriendly Death</a>. The start of episode 48 does adapt the actual scene of their deaths, although it still appears a bit toned down. The scene is further bowdlerized in the dub, which cuts Von Bogoot shooting the sisters, as well as making snippets to the rest of their death sequence.</span></li><li> Before the dub of "Legend of the Super Galaxy" was available in its original full cut, fans had to make do with a shortened 92 minute version that trimmed the violence, as well as scenes and dialogue relating to the team members' backstories.</li><li> This trope also hit when Jo Onodera adapted "Conclusion: God's War" from light novel format to manga for Club Sunday: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the light novel, 004 is stated to have lost his ENTIRE lower half in the climactic battle, just before the moment where he asks 007 to leave him to self-destruct. In the manga, his legs are stomped on and he's rendered crippled. The novel also had 002 not only get bisected, but also lose both arms. In the manga, Jet is still torn in half, but retains his arms (although one is crushed).</span></li><li> In the original manga and anime, Jet/002 is an atheist. A key point in the manga version of the "Underground Empire" arc (as well as in the equivalent moment in the anime) has him internally pleading that although he's never believed in a God, that now he's praying to them that he can save 009. An earlier moment in the 2001 anime (in episode 4) also has Jet angrily state "I don't even believe in God!", when he rants that he cannot trust anyone. As far as the English adaptations went? Tokyopop toned down Jet's lack of faith to have him state that he needed "luck", while the dub changed Jet's line in episode 4 to be "I couldn't even trust my parents!" and changed his internal monologue in episode 48 into a general speech of facing his destiny and ridding the world of evil.</li><li> In final episode of <em>Call of Justice</em> the Emperor states he will become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. The English dub alters this to him more generically stating he will become <em>a</em> god.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>: 004 only runs out of bullets and/or rockets when it is dramatically appropriate for him to no longer be able to shoot that episode, and is never shown acquiring or installing reloads.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>: Francoise once loses her powers while in the mountains, and under certain conditions as well.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Happens to Albert at the end of "Legend of the Super Galaxy", when he's brought back to life- but it's then quickly averted when he requests that Dr. Gilmore turn him back into a cyborg.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">But Not Too Foreign</a>: Averted with a passion. The 00-Numbers are explicitly all non-Japanese, to the point that they come from eras and backgrounds that largely prevent them from even traveling out of their home countries. Joe is the exception, being half-Japanese and having a father of an unspecified ethnicity, but he was born and raised in Japan - and got bullied and ostracized by society for being biracial and a bastard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>: Ishinomori himself did not consider "Empty War", "The Man with the Expensive Castle", or the retconned origin in the prologue to the Underground Empire to be canon. The first is due to the fact that he re-wrote it as "A New Type of Bomb" (most manga releases include both versions alongside each other), and the latter two examples have to do with his distaste for having to rewrite 007 into being a child to tie into the changes that were made in the first film adaptation. There's also a visual discrepancy within that origin; while the narration mentions Joe having been captured on his escape from Kurihama, the artwork depicts an ambulance carrying him off (much like the one in the film, that carried him off after his racing accident).<ul><li> The manga version of "God's War" essentially overwrites the unfinished "Angel" and "Battle with the Gods" arcs, which were the first and second prototypes of Ishinomori's concept for the "last Cyborg 009 story".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryingTheAntidote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryingTheAntidote">Carrying the Antidote</a>: A whole episode focuses on the Cyborgs trying to stop the Villains Of The Week who were trying to use biological bombs to get people sick and then sell them the antidote.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatSmile">Cat Smile</a>: Dr. Kozumi's mustache is in the shape of this.

The 00 Cyborgs were also referred to as "The Galaxy Legion", perhaps to better explain why they'd be going out into outer space.</li><li> The Spanish dub of <em>Super Galaxy</em> also had its own name changes in store: Jet was renamed "Zanahoria" ("carrot", for his red hair), Albert to "Siegfried", Geronimo Junior to "Arizona", and "Great Britain" to "Chamberlain".

His surname was inspired by the science fiction writer A.E. von Vogt, although the katakana used to spell his surname (&#12532;&#12449;&#12531;&#12539;&#12532;&#12457;&#12540;&#12463;&#12488;) is different from the Black Ghost character (&#12496;&#12531;&#12539;&#12508;&#12464;&#12540;&#12488;). This may have been intentional by Ishinomori, or there may have been difficulty in trying to render the name in Japanese.</li><li> The Pu'Awak sister with the blue tiara is "Vina" in the English dub, while Tokyopop referred to her as "Venus". The katakana spelling her name is &#12499;&#12540;&#12490;, which can be rendered in multiple different spelling (Vina, Beena, Bina, Veena, etc.). The spelling "Venu" has also been seen, as it's theorized that Ishinomori <em>might</em> have had the Roman goddess in mind but altered the name slightly (removing the "su" katakana). "Vena" is another option presented that keeps the pronunciation intact but edges closer to the possible intent.</li><li> 001's name is sometimes spelled "Iwon Whisky" in official materials, owing to the difficulties of rendering "Ivan" in Japanese and then translating it back. It has also been seen as "Ivan Wisky", which Archaia used in their version as well.</li><li> 006's name, due to the complexities of the Chinese alphabet, has alternatively been rendered as "Zhang Zhanghu", "Chang Changhu", "Chan Chanko" (based off the Japanese spelling of his name), and "Chang Chanko" (used in the dub).</li><li> 002's surname sometimes appears as "Rink", due to L/R confusion, although Ishinomori and most related materials use "Link".</li><li> 008's name is sometimes translated as "Punma" or "Puma".</li><li> Some fansubbers tend to render 003's family name as Arnelle rather than Arnoul.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishRobots">Starfish Robots</a>: 0011 resembles a flying saucer; its "windows" can shoot adhesives, or 0011 can bring out its legs through them. 0012 serves as the AI for an even bigger mech.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>: 008 throws one in Episode 4 (2001):<div class="indent"> <strong>008:</strong> Let's see how he likes being behind the 8-ball for once.

Scarl does this so often that it's practically his modus operandi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText">Truer to the Text</a>: Aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate">Setting Update</a> (which had to be written around for the first four Cyborgs), the 2001 anime is primarily a direct adaptation of the first ten volumes of the manga, utilizing characters and concepts that were generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">skipped</a> or altered in previous adaptations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">Unexplained Recovery</a>:<ul><li> As far as the 2001 anime goes, the writers seemingly don't explain how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">002 and 009 survived their fall to Earth</span> when they aired the "Conclusion: God's War" OVA arc after the end of the Underground Empire arc. This is due to the fact that episodes 49-51 of that adaptation aren't counted as being in continuity with the rest of the series, although fans would only know this from some outside sources (such as the artbooks), or if they were aware that the events of "God's War" are meant to happen in a timeline parallel to the original one created by Ishinomori. In short, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">002 and 009 <em>are</em> dead at the end of episode 48, while episodes 49-51 take place in a timeline where they survived</span>. The English and Latin American dubs getting rid of the special opening and ending sequences for the arc may add to the confusion.</li><li> As far as the manga goes, Ishinomori was rather vague on what happened to the 00 cyborgs after the Mythos arc, or how they survived the explosion. This probably had to do with the fact that the manga switched magazines after that arc, and he had to re-introduce the characters with a retconned version of their origin story.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalDriversLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalDriversLicense">Universal Driver's License</a>: Justified, since Joe is able to become a star car racer in the manga thanks to his enhancements.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a>: In <em>Call of Justice</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emperor starts becoming enraged as the 00-Cyborgs persist against him, despite all being woefully underpowered compared to him.

After Emperor kills Catalina with his powers, a vengeful 009 exceeds his usual Acceleration speed so Emperor can't even read his movements, and traps Emperor in a white void where he will be alone forever. It's where Emperor's cool facade finally breaks completely and he's reduced to a ranting, screaming madman.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a>: Black Ghost, who sells highly advanced weapons to the highest bidder and manipulates things behind the scenes to stoke the fires of conflict so more weapons can be sold.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: Near the end of the Mythos arc, Dr. Gaia (who built the Greek god cyborgs) reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is still loyal to Black Ghost, even though Black Ghost was seemingly destroyed before the start of the arc.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?</a>: Sometimes, poor 003 could only sit and watch as things went boom, causing her genuine psychological problems and, at some point, almost sending her into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> until 004 asked if she'd rather be a war machine like him.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: Horribly twisted during the "God's War" OVA arc when the cyborgs go through a collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> meant to draw out the fear that, underneath it all, they really <em>are</em> just horrible monsters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">along with the rest of humanity</a>. This is also visible in the "Battle with the Gods" arc in the manga, when the team members suddenly experience flashbacks to shameful things they had done. The manga and light novel version of "God's War" has another take on this, where the team is driven mad and wind up either nearly killing themselves or others in their despair (leaving Ivan to have to bail them out).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a>: 2001: Episode 38 relates the history of the 00-cyborg project as filtered through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Gilmore's eyes</a>.
