He is ostracised by his former friends and becomes a victim of their bullying himself, forcing him to spend the rest of his schooldays alone and bitter.

The story unfolds as Shoya and Shoko get to know each other as real people and struggle with the emotional scars of their pasts.</p><p><em>A Silent Voice</em> (or <em>Koe no Katachi</em> in Japanese; literally "The Shape of Voice") initially started out life as a one-shot in 2008. It was later redone in the February 2011 edition of <em>Bessatsu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenMagazine">Sh&#333;nen Magazine</a></em>. While it won the 80th Weekly Sh&#333;nen Magazine Newbie Best Mangaka Award, its subject matter made it difficult for publication on any manga magazine until it was picked up after months of legal dispute by the August 2013 edition of <em>Weekly Sh&#333;nen Magazine</em>. It's also sponsored by the Japanese Federation of the Deaf.</p><p>An anime film adaptation produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a> was released to Japanese theaters on September 17, 2016.

The other regularly appearing adults aren't much better - Shoko's mother is extremely harsh <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although in her case, she acts that way in the hopes that it'll make Shoko a stronger person</span>, while Shoya's mother is busy and mostly ignorant of what her son is up to - for example, she doesn't figure out that he was suicidal until a few days after he originally planned to kill himself. It's even gone into some depth with Shoya's mother in Ueno's focus chapter - she's so overwhelmed by the situation that she doesn't know what to do, which unfortunately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">puts Ueno in the position of locking everyone else out of Shoya's hospital room.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToRoutine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToRoutine">Allergic to Routine</a>: Young Shoya is in a constant state of fighting off boredom. The biggest flaw of this is that he tries to fight it off with no concern for the consequences either to himself or the people around him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>: Shoko Nishimiya, who forgives her former bully, and accepts his offer for friendship.

It's unclear if this is real and Shoko's mother ripped the earring from her ear, or if Ishida's just imagining his mother with a wound similar to what he did to Shoko, possibly as the start of his remorse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shoko to Shoya</span>.

There's one time she does get worked up in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake">Omake</a> though - Yuzuru is the one responsible for teaching Shoko what spoken language the latter can learn, and Yuzuru makes a point to practice saying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Moon" after Shoko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a> was misheard as talking about the moon</span>. When Shoko realizes, they start roughhousing. In the manga, Shoko gets visibly angry at Yuzuru after finding out that she took the photo of Shoya jumping off the bridge and posted it online to get him suspended.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologisesALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologisesALot">Apologises a Lot</a>: Shoko, a depressed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a> who feels responsible when other people have a problem with her disability, and Shoya, who, well, has a lot to apologise for.

Following his years of being bullied himself, along with a lot of time to think and mature, he's become very, <em>very</em> remorseful for what he's done to Shoko in the past. The plot is kicked off by his attempts to befriend her, with the reveal that he's learned sign language the first sign that he's very serious about making ammends.

Feeling guilty over the bullying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that she did towards Ishida because she felt peer pressure into doing so after Ishida became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat">The Scapegoat</a></span>, the character in question has secretly been including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hirose and Shimada, the two former friends of Ishida that became the ringleaders in bullying him</span>, into also helping with the movie, with the hopes that it would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">restore the friendship between Ishida and his old friends</span>. There are hints that, because of this attitude, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">part of Ueno does realize just how badly she treats Nishimiya and does feel guilt over that as well, but her jealousy keeps her resentful.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a>: Shoya's two potential love interests: Shoko (Betty), the sweet and shy deaf girl who forgives him for having bullied her, and Ueno (Veronica), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> / borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> who can't express her feelings for him in the right way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a>:<ul><li> Yuzuru, Shoko's little sister, makes such a convincing boy that Ishida actually believed her when she claims to be Shoko's boyfriend.</li><li> Sahara as well, although it isn't really commented on in the story.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>:<ul><li> Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> Ueno is seen working at a cat cafe and seems a whole lot nicer than before. The next few chapters brutally destroy that assumption as she tears into Nagatsuka for misinterpreting the love letter to Ishida and then proceeds to try and resume bullying Nishimiya. Ironically, Chapter 50 revealed that five years ago Ueno started seeing <em>Nishimiya</em> as this, believing she's using her disability to get Ishida's attention.</li><li> Let's not forget Kawai.

Shoya Ishida, ends up as the scapegoat for his entire class, taking all the blame for Shoko's torment and spends the next few years suffering treatment almost worse then Shoko at the hands of students and teachers, well also bearing horrible guilt over what he did to Shoko before she left school. He completely shuns his class and foresees nothing but a life of endless suffering ahead for him, which eventually makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">plan to kill himself</a> early in the series.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a>:<ul><li> Ishida and Nishimiya.

Since she's in a kimono, it looks like the right flap of her kimono is on top, which is traditionally only done for corpses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She just had failed to commit suicide and watched Shouya fall to what could have been his death to stop her - she had felt her whole life was shattered, and the one person outside her family that she felt close to might have killed himself to save her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">Misery Builds Character</a>: Brutally.

While Kawai didn't instigate the bullying like Shouya and Ueno, Kawai did nothing to help Shouko and laughed along with them, but refused to acknowledge she had any part in the bullying and it's even her crying when Shouya points it out that gets him labeled as the class' scapegoat. Years later, she still refuses to believe she had any part in Shouko's bullying.
