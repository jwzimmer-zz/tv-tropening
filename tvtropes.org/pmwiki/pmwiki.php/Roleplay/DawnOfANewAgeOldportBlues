Real-life social issues and prejudice affect the characters, as does all the baggage that comes with being a young person still trying to understand the world. Which is not to say that it's all doom and gloom: for all that their newfound powers can be dangerous, they also open up new avenues for heroism, friendship, and fun.</p><p>The roleplay can be found <a class="urllink" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=14965006070A50966600&amp;page=1">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

The lights come back on immediately afterwards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedWarehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedWarehouse">Abandoned Warehouse</a>: The Heritage Battlefront, a local Neo-Nazi group, shacked themselves up in an abandoned warehouse in the north of town. Benjy comes across them and ends up killing them, setting up a confrontation between him and the other superpowered kids in the derelict building.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyIneffectiveBarricade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyIneffectiveBarricade">Absurdly Ineffective Barricade</a>: Ivy tries to barricade against the smoke snakes by pushing a desk against the door. It might've worked out except, as Simon points out, the snakes are made of fog and can easily slip through the gap under the door.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">Absurdly Spacious Sewer</a>: One future has Zia trawling through the DC sewers. They're mostly covered in gunk and slime, with enough space to house discarded furniture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming">Accidental Misnaming</a>:<ul><li> Simon is anti-social, and as a result has trouble remembering people's names. Calling Mirielle 'Mary-Anne', Ivy 'Ivanna', Ciro 'Cyril', etc.</li><li> In a similar instance, Ivy is only vaguely familiar with Melissa and Irene, and so mistakenly refers to them as Marissa and Eileen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> when Edward mispronounces Ciro's name during their introduction (Zee-ro instead of See-ro), and continues to do so after Ciro corrects him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">Accidental Murder</a>:<ul><li> Zia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">inability to control her telepathy</a> nearly leads to her murdering Jessica and Ivy via a mental chokehold. Thankfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">subverted</a> when she was able to regain control at the last second, though the incident still shook her.</li><li> Upon first discovering his vampiric abilities, Daigo accidentally murdered a man who was beating his wife. The 'accidental' part is somewhat questionable.</li><li> In the lead up to the finals, Jacob accidentally uses his time powers to rewind a screwdriver into Barbra, killing her. Fortunately her power is immortality, but the incident still takes a great mental toll on him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementTestOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementTestOfDestiny">Achievement Test of Destiny</a>: The roleplay starts a week away from finals. Some of the students stay after school because they're cramming in some extra studying. The students who took Biology are especially freaking out because their teacher is so unpredictable about what he puts on the test.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: It's noted that the disappearance of several students, followed by absences during a school evacuation, is a great source of fear for the children's parents.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead">Affectionate Gesture to the Head</a>: Ciro ruffles Michal's hair after the latter acts particularly childish.

The snakes attack before he can try it out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a>: Zia's bike, affectionally dubbed 'Frankenbike' due to being a mishmash of parts from several other bicycles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: A few of the main characters have alliterative names- Edward Eisen, Finn Flannagan, Sebastian Smith- along with Hyeon's cousin, Jae Jung. It fits with the overall comicbook influence of the roleplay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">Ambiguous Syntax</a>: Ziz arrives on the roof of the school and projects a question for Jacob- "DISPLAY COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF KNOWN ENTITIES AT THIS LOCATION - ?". Jacob assumes that Ziz is asking him if Ziz should display the list it has, when in actuality Ziz is asking Jacob for the list, leading to both parties getting annoyed with the other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnkleDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnkleDrag">Ankle Drag</a>: One of the smoke snakes wraps around Jessica's ankle and drags her into a cloud of fog. The other students can only watch helplessly before more snakes appear to drag them in too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxCut">Anti Climax Cut</a>: At one point Emmanuel calls Mirielle but is interrupted by the Dark Dragon, who sends him flying into a tree and seriously injures him. Mirielle implores Benjy to use his wings to go and rescue Emmanuel... and then it time skips to later that evening, which offhandedly mentions that the group picked up Emmanuel and bandaged him offscreen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics">Antiquated Linguistics</a>: Hyeon dips into using flowery language to mock an overly formal text that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProudElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProudElite">Benedict</a> sent him:<div class="indent">Verily, &#145;twas not my intent to bring dishonor and misfortune upon thy Clan of the Tudor.

They then realise that they're in an April Fools joke, and things resume as normal.</li><li> The April Fools post for 2019 features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashforward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashforward">flashforward</a> that seems serious at first, until Ivy plays a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">particular song.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter">Archetypal Character</a>: Crispin tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforce</a> the idea that the superpowered kids fit the archetypes present in his story. It's quickly called out as bullshit since the archetypes he points out are shoehorned (Ivy isn't the Mastermind of the group, for one example) and don't cover the rest of the kids that were empowered too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>: Hyeon explaining to Benedict why they're making weed brownies instead of smoking it raw: it lasts longer that way, it's more mild if Benedict has a bad reaction and, most importantly, it's <em>delicious</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssuranceBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssuranceBackfire">Assurance Backfire</a>: Luna tries to reassure Ivy that Travers wouldn't try and kill them in a public place like a classroom. However, Ivy then says that if Travers was to murder <em>everyone</em> in the room, then 'technically' it could count as a private space.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicFBomb">Atomic F-Bomb</a>: When Finn recovers from one flashforward, Zia is able to hear that his stream of thought is one long, loud 'F' before he cuts himself off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">Bad Powers, Bad People</a>: Three members of Daigo's gang gained powers to match their unscrupulous nature:<ul><li> Daigo himself became a vampire that grows stronger by drinking blood, or can force mutations in others by forcing <em>them</em> to drink <em>his</em> blood.</li><li> His girlfriend, Melissa, can turn into smoke.

Which rings a little hollow when the end of the school year is just a week or two away- even if Shooter meant the next semester it would still mean little to Ciro, since he's 12th grade and thus about to graduate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">Hell Is That Noise</a>: The sound of ticking that starts up above the 10th grade exams, which clues in some of the students below that there's bombs set in the school.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a>: Many of the heroes are societal outcasts.

Ivan isn't as aware of what's happening, but follows Ciro out of curiosity.
