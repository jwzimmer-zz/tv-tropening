At one point he looks on the horizon and sees what is likely the Ambassador Bridge in the background. Just one little problem. Ferndale is completely landlocked- there are no rivers, creeks or canals of any size anywhere near it, and the Ambassador Bridge is at least 15 miles (24.14 km) from the border of the city.</li><li> Kara and Alice are trying to make it out of Detroit and into Canada. Take a minute to go look up where downtown Detroit is. The game depicts them as traveling for multiple days, perhaps a *week* to make this journey. Did you look it up? That's right, Detroit is literally on the border between the US and Canada, and even taking the long route north is a matter of hours by car. There are two ways Kara's route makes any amount of sense; either they intended to cross the border at Niagara Falls (which is supported by Rose when she says her androids are "crossing the river"), or they somehow left the Detroit metro area <em>entirely</em> and then <em>came back</em> (supported by their eventual arrival at Jericho).

Namely, Carlos' android can shoot itself or bash its head into the desk after The Interrogation (or later in its prison cell), Rupert jumps off the roof after being cornered by Connor (with the latter <em>specifically</em> pointing out that he will be decommissioned for deviancy), Simon shoots himself if Connor probes his memory at the rooftop, Deviant Operator shoots himself if Connor doesn't shoot him, Machine Connor can drop himself of the roof to avoid trouble with Captain Allen (despite not being a deviant), and finally, Markus and his friends can burn themselves in front of the soldiers if they're cornered by them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>: Markus's owner, Carl, encourages this in Markus.

Since most of the androids you meet early on (until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Markus starts converting them by hand</span>) go deviant by murdering their owners, regardless of why, continued violence would only make it look like the androids really <em>are</em> just ticking time bombs and give the humans no reason to believe they shouldn't just wipe them out (and there's no chance for the androids to win that fight for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of the story</span>).</li><li> It's less confusing if you take the actual aesop as "stand up for yourself, and don't just lash out". Standing up does not mean fighting back, but there are situations where the two overlap. Basically, the problems pile up when the majority of self-deviating androids choose violent options even though they're smart enough to find ways to escape (like Kara, who can escape from her psychotic owner and even save another person in the process), and part of the pacifist path is teaching these androids to weigh their options, and consider violence IF it really is the optimal choice (which it usually isn't). And if you're giving in to the terms of someone else's negotiation without setting some conditions, that's not standing up.</li><li> The game has a message about giving freedom to androids because they are "alive" and shouldn't be forced to serve humans in a direct parallel to African-American slavery, but the game itself makes this questionable by Kamski's explanation that deviancy is the result of a program error that is spread between androids that exchange identification data. Although the characters themselves <em>act</em> completely human in-game, this explanation nonetheless makes androids less analogous to oppressed minorities and more to malfunctioning hardware, which would never have come alive at all, no matter how much it was abused, if it didn't have an error in the program.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedInAPileOfCorpses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedInAPileOfCorpses">Buried in a Pile of Corpses</a>:<ul><li> In the <em>Kara Captured</em> route of <em>Battle for Detroit</em>, Kara and her family get brought to a recycling camp to be disassembled.

However, the hiding androids will make some noise and Kara (the playable character) must make a quick decision to cover it. The wrong decision will cause the police officer to investigate further.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a>:<ul><li> The earliest parts of the game show Detroit as a clean, colorful city where all menial tasks are efficiently tended to by androids, but you barely have to scratch the veneer to see the resentment of economically-displaced human workers or the ways in which androids are exploited and abused.</li><li> The concept of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment">technological unemployment<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has come to full fruition in the United States, as in 2038, 10 years after the Android Act was passed into law, almost <em>40 percent</em> of the American workforce is unemployed, and to show this, multiple homeless people are seen on the streets of Detroit with signs blaming androids as to why they lost their livelihoods. For a comparison, unemployment in United States during the Great Depression only went up to 25%.<ul><li> By contrast, neighbouring Canada has not done the same, as they prohibit the sale or manufacture of androids on Canadian soil, and due to this androids have no discernible legal status in the country. And by all accounts, Canada is doing quite well, with no mass unemployment due to jobs being replaced by androids and the country still keeping much of its environment and political freedoms in the process.</li></ul></li><li> Magazine articles point to a rather bleak world. Global warming had reached a point of no return and multiple animal species went extinct due to human effects on the environment. There's even an android zoo that showcases many extinct animal species.</li><li> TV news and the magazines also point to the new cold war between the United States and Russia, where during the events of the game there is a large confrontation in the Barents Sea over Russian annexation claims to the ice field there, and as the game goes on, they nearly go to war.</li><li> It's implied that America will soon suffer a population crisis over the fact that most people are deciding to purchase androids and have sex with them rather than finding a human partner. Even if a person doesn't want to spend between $900 and $8,000 on a personal android, there's an android sex club in the heart of the city that only charges $30 for 30 minutes alone with a sex bot. (And since, as mentioned above, unemployment is literally the highest in US history, the value of the dollar will likely be at its lowest ever, so $30 in 2037 would likely be the equivalent of around US$7.50 today.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense">Crime of Self-Defense</a>: Nearly all deviants (excluding the ones that are "infected" by other deviants) became that way due to some form of self-preservation.

Markus's narrative is given over to it.</li><li> Ironically inverted with Markus. His owner, Carl, was the one to encourage Markus to be who he chooses to be. For Markus' part, he never saw Carl as a master or owner, but as his father.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncertainDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncertainDoom">Uncertain Doom</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In one ending combination, a Connor that remained a machine can spare Markus or North when they are cornered in a store after a failed revolution. Considering that there is an entire army sweeping for deviants in Detroit, their fate afterwards is left completely ambiguous.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundRailroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundRailroad">Underground Railroad</a>: Rose and others help androids crossing the border to Canada.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">The Unreveal</a>: Who or what is rA9, which is a prevalent symbol throughout the three protagonists' journey? ... Well, some playthroughs result in players never finding out. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">that kind of game</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>:<ul><li> Upon arrival at the hostage situation we can see that a fish tank has been smashed by gunfire, leaving an unfortunate fish lying on the ground. Connor is able to pick it up and place it back in the water that&#146;s still in the tank.</li><li> The hostage scenario itself will allow the player to save a child's life, depending on the player's choices.</li><li> Kara's story will revolve around being Alice's guardian. Among numerous other choices, Kara can choose to buy (or steal) toys and other conveniences for Alice.</li><li> In Zlatko's mansion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can free the android bear trapped in a cage upstairs.

Hank says that he has changed his mind on androids and wants to stop Connor. Hank will then fight Connor to the death. Whatever relationship Connor had with Hank will tank to "Tense" or "Hostile".</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">Wham Shot</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kara seeing an android Alice with the circle LED attached. This leads to a flashback where she sees Alice on a CyberLife sales magazine and Luther explaining to her that she's been repressing her knowledge that Alice was an android out of her need to protect her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidYouExpectWhenYouNamedIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidYouExpectWhenYouNamedIt">What Did You Expect When You Named It ____?</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That Jericho is destroyed really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Unsurprisingly considering how the game has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>, sometimes supporting characters just get lost when their protagonist dies and no-one is left to care about them. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">letting Kara and Alice die in the raid on Jericho</span> results in never finding out what happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luther, who was ambiguously left to "meet up with" the pair at the border despite having an injury and being trapped in Jericho</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>: Omnipresent throughout the story for androids, but particularly in Markus' story. Comparisons to slavery and second-class status (such as segregation and disenfranchisement) are abundant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">What the Hell, Player?</a>: If the player makes some <em>astoundingly</em> stupid decisions that causes anticlimactic or extremely early deaths for the player characters, it will cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> (which is unique since the game most of the time carries on with the player's poor choices instead of giving a game over that forces a reset) with Chloe (the android on the main menu) chastising the player for their poor decisions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: Sometimes, the player can make a completely selfish choice without much in the way of karma.<ul><li> If Markus is kicked out of Jericho during "Crossroads", he will be wandering outside when the government raid occurs. He can choose to flee and let Jericho be crushed.</li><li> If Kara and Alice (and possibly Luther) are captured and taken to the recycling plant, Kara can volunteer to drag off an android corpse and then hide among the dead bodies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This will get Alice and Luther killed, but Kara survives.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys">Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?</a>: Jericho's resources scale up quite fast when Markus finally joins them (assuming he's a successful leader). At first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're basically a bunch of scared civilians squatting in a single cargo room in a derelict, dingy freighter &mdash; Markus will remark that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredRobotMeterMaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredRobotMeterMaids">only an android</a> would have been able to enter, as they have to navigate a maze of perilous jumps and scrappy falls from a rusted interior. They're fearful of even leaving the freighter to steal spare parts from a CyberLife depot to keep themselves from breaking down</span>. By the end of the game, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Markus accrues numerous followers, Jericho's freighter is renovated into a base for hundreds of androids (and they clean up their natural defenses into an entrance for new followers to freely enter on foot), and they will have plenty of assault rifles, plastic explosives, and other military-grade hardware regardless of whether or not Markus is approaching the revolution peacefully</span>. The game never directly states where the sudden surge of resources come from, besides the implication of <em>mass</em> android defections and theft, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">military androids that the government has to put down</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality">White-and-Grey Morality</a>: Androids are definitely considered good, but humans also have their own justifiable plights against them with androids taking their jobs and having difficulties accepting the androids' sentience. The only real evil people in the story are unpleasant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a>, true sociopathic people who are horrifying even by human standards, and the meddling CyberLife (through Connor's actions via Amanda's orders, which often causes deviant androids to go berserk and kill innocents around them out of Connor's pressuring). Kamski is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">Wins by Doing Absolutely Nothing</a>: During the Markus vs. Connor fight, the player can get their favorable character to win by selecting their opponent and then ignoring their QTEs entirely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: Hank and Connor had no problem tussling with the two female androids at Eden's Club. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Connor also later on has the option to shoot Chloe in the head at Kamski's mansion.</span><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The male military soldiers unquestionably gunned down androids during the revolution regardless of their gender.</span></li><li> Todd frequently, relentlessly physically abused Alice and Kara.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
