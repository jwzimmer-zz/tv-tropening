They have a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a>, where new sylvari are grown with innate knowledge passed down to them by the tree, drawn from the pool of collective experiences of living sylvari who return to commune with their parent, infusing them with a powerful communal morality.

These classes are divided into Scholars (light armor), Adventurers (medium armor), and Soldiers (heavy armor). Any race is able to play any profession equally well and each profession has a "unique mechanic" that greatly distinguishes it from the others. With the release of <em>Heart of Thorns</em> every class also gains access to an elite specialization, which adds new mechanics to the existing ones and possibly broading the experience with those classes. The first indentation is the specialization that requires <em>Heart of Thorns</em> to access, while the second are the ones that require <em>Path of Fire</em>.</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about classes and specializations&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elementalist</a> &mdash; A scholar profession focusing on, not surprisingly, magic based on the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourElementEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourElementEnsemble">Four-Element Ensemble</a>. Unlike most other classes, instead of swapping weapons, the Elementalist can swap "attunements", which change all five weapon skills to a new element; fire focuses on damage-dealing, water on healing, air on crowd control, and earth on defense. With their slew of 20 weapon skills combined with a wide variety of utility skills, they are highly versatile in combat.<ul><li> The <strong>Tempest</strong> wields a warhorn, perform shout skills, and "overload" the attunements to generate large and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">strong</a> AoE-effects.</li><li> The <strong>Weaver</strong> has mastered the ability to wield two of the elements at once and use stances. They usually wield a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">sword in their main hand</a>, while their other hand controls a second attunement, and their third skill is unique, dependent on the two elements wielded and the weapons used.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a>: A scholar profession based on the manipulation of death. Both the death of surrounding creatures as well as numerous skills build up a resource named "Life Force". This can be used to cloak the necromancer in the "Death Shroud", which replaces the weapon skills and layers a second health bar, absorbing the damage from Life Force rather than the actual health. Together with their naturally large health pool this gives them quite some steadfestness.<ul><li> The <strong>Reaper</strong>, grants access to the greatsword weapon, shout skills and an alternative "Reaper's Shroud". Their skills offer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">slow but powerful</a> damage and crowd control, invoking the style of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">classic movie monsters</a> and classic Death Knights from other games.</li><li> <strong>Scourge</strong>, on the other hand, essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">give up</a> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter">shroud ability</a> to summon sand wraithes that they can channel abilities through that can either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plaguemaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plaguemaster">heavily</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">corrupt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">their</a> enemies or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">protect their allies</a> with barriers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">sand.</a> They use a torch to help them with this. They use Punishments to defeat their enemies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Mesmer</a>: A scholar profession focused on illusion magic. Their fighting style is based around the creation of doppelgangers, that can be shattered to hurt enemies and/or buff themselves. They are divided into phantasms (easy to spot, additional effects) and clones (identical but powerless). These illusions can be furthermore used as a distraction. The Mesmer also applies Confusion with many of their attacks, a negative condition that inflicts damage on the victim whenever they use any sort of ability.<ul><li> With the <strong>Chronomancer</strong>, the Mesmer gains an elite specialization that revolves around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">time</a>. They can equip shields for increased defensive and supportive capability, and gain abilities to alter their allies' skill cooldowns with an effect called "alacrity" and slow down their enemies actions and increase their cooldowns.</li><li> In the desert, mesmers instead specialize as <strong>Mirage</strong>s. They wield an axe in their mainhand, and give up their ability to dodge for the Mirage Cloak, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">which allows them to avoid hits without interrupting their actions or requiring a dedicated dodge roll</a>. They specialize in Deception magic.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForestRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForestRanger">Ranger</a>: An adventurer profession with an animal companion. Those companions are permanent and follow them into battle, can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyDurableEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyDurableEnemies">tank</a> for the ranger, since they are much more difficult to hurt than other creatures. Both the ranger and their pet revolve about boon sharing and wearing down the enemy with an array of skills that allow them to stay away from the enemy. Equipped with the longbow, the ranger has the longest range of all classes.<ul><li> The <strong>Druid</strong> is a step towards a classic healer. They can wield staffs and temporarily transform themselves into Celestial Avatars capable of healing and sustaining small squads of allies. They learn glyphs that change function whether or not the druid is in Celestial form.</li><li> <strong>Soulbeasts</strong> learn to merge with their pets, not only learning new Stances but some of their pets' skills. They wield a dagger in their main hand.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicThief">Thief</a>: An adventurer profession that makes use of their vast mobility to surprise attack single enemies. Instead of having cooldown timers on their weapon skills, the Thief consumes "Initiative" instead. Thus they can spam a strong attack multiple times before running out of initiative. Their set of skills revolve around evasion, stealth and 'stealing' to gain a unique, one-use attack that differs depending on the target enemy.<ul><li> The <strong>Daredevil</strong> takes the concept of the duellist further, granting a third endurance bar for more dodges and an array of physical utility skills that interrupt and disable enemies. Their trademark weapon is a staff, but used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleStaff">melee striking weapon</a> rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff">magical implement</a>.</li><li> The <strong>Deadeye</strong> is a sniper class, using a rifle to shoot enemies from afar. They use Cantrips to increase their accuracies, and have a new mechanic of Malice that does extra damage to their marked target.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">Engineer</a>: An adventurer profession that uses guns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a> and rifles, as well as a number of technological gadgets for offense, healing, and control. Like the Elementalist, they are only able to carry one weaponset, but makes up for that with "kits", that replace the weapon skills for different purposes. Additionally the Engineer has 'toolbelt' skills, gaining one each for every utility skill equipped. Thematically they're able to set up little gadgets and turrets to fight with, including comically inspired skills like a battering ram on a spring, rocket boots or spilling slicky oil.<ul><li> The <strong>Scrapper</strong> uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">drones</a> to manipulate the battlefield and provide various forms of utility autonomously. They wield a gigantic hammer in battle, specializing in area of effect damage, crowd control and some defensive capability.</li><li> The <strong>Holosmith</strong> picks up a sword and a Photon Forge, that allows them to summon various holographic weapons. They use Exceed skills, and have a heat meter that relates to how they use their forge.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Warrior</a>: A soldier profession and master of arms that can use nearly every weapon in the game. Every weapon grants access to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">very strong attack</a>, consuming adrenaline which the warrior builds in combat. Their variety of skills allow the Warrior to be used in multiple roles, whether as the frontline of a squad, focused damage dealer, or supportive player with crowd control and Banners for stat buffs.<ul><li> The <strong>Berserker</strong> elite-specialization gives the warrior a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> that greatly enhances their adrenaline-based attacks. They can equip a torch and deal powerful fire-based condition damage and become significantly more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">focused</a> on offensive capabilities, to the point where even their unique heal skill requires doing damage to get the most out of it.</li><li> <strong>Spellbreaker</strong>s are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">boon-denial</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">Mage Killer</a> dueling class, wielding daggers in both hands and specialize in Mediation skills.

Many skills carry an offensive and a defensive component, which makes their use a double edged sword. They're mostly found in melee range, while lacking strong ranged moves.<ul><li> The <strong>Dragonhunter</strong> gains the ability to use a longbow and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster">trap</a> skills. Virtues also become more physical when activated, manifesting as a spear of immobilizing light, wings that convey the Dragonhunter to a target destination, or a wall-shield to block enemy attacks.</li><li> The <strong>Firebrand</strong>, meanwhile, trades their virtues for Tomes, which allow them to summon ancient books. They also learn Mantras, which each have 3 charges, with the last being more powerful than the previous two. They wield an axe in their main hand.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">Revenant</a>: A soldier profession introduced in <em>Heart of Thorns</em>, and restricted to players who have bought an expansion. They can use their connection to the Mists to invoke the power of legendary figures and channel attacks from/through the Mists. Their access to legends give them access to different playstyles, as support, pure damage, condition damage or healing. The Revenant has the fewest choices for abilities, being limited to one ability for each slot for each legend they can invoke. Their concept is loosely based on the Ritualist from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a>: Factions, which could summon spirits and channel powers from the mists.<ul><li> The <strong>Herald</strong> elite specialization allows them to channel Glint, the benevolent dragon that rebelled against her masters and sought to protect Tyria instead. Heralds can equip shields to protect and heal allies. Invoking Glint provides access to "facet" skills which provide auras and buffs when first activated, and can be consumed/re-activated to unleash powerful area-of-effect blasts.</li><li> The <strong>Renegade</strong> elite specialization summons Kalla Scorchrazor, the female charr who helped fight the shaman caste and allowed females to fight in warbands once more. They wield a shortbow, summon Kalla's warband members to buff allies, and can tear a fabric in reality to do various attacks.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p>The game has a level cap of 80, with skills and abilities being a mixture of weapon choice and individual customization. Instead of traditional quests, it makes use of 'Dynamic Events' and 'Renown Hearts', which simulate quest conditions out in the world for the player to solve rather than filling up a quest log in a town. There are also individualized personal stories based on a player's race and what choices they made during character creation. Some characters will also react differently to players depending on their class, race or background selection.</p><p>Since January 2013, the developers have released regular "Living Story" updates. These updates provide episodic story chapters that last roughly a month before being made unavailable. Since these updates are all building towards a bigger story, for people who want to catch up, a summary of the story so far can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Summary">on the game's official wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and some kind Youtubers have <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWlcIGXrHRQxugVaQPiGh4tvUSeCcRuQA">thoroughly recorded all of the story update content.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> As of July 2014, the Living World has become more episodic, with a storyline unlocked for level 80 characters if they log in during the 2-week span and then able to play through the story whenever they want on all characters. Players who do miss this window will be able to buy the chapters for gems.</p><p>On October 29th, 2015, ArenaNet released their first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, "Heart of Thorns". This expanded the game by adding explorable areas to the west, adding a new class, and giving each class ways to expand via elite specializations. Unlike many modern MMOs, the level cap has not be raised, and there is no new gear tier. November 17th added in other elements promised in the expansions, such as raiding, the new squad interface allowing for a party of 10 players, and new legendary weapons that can be unlocked. Heart of Thorns was followed by Living World Season 3, expanding on the White Mantle faction from GW1 and providing new locales to explore all over Tyria.</p><p>After a major leak of information, Anet officially confirmed that they were working on a second expansion intended for release some time in the second half of 2017. On September 23, 2017, the second expansion, "Path of Fire" was released, taking place in the Crystal Desert and northern Elona. Mounts were added to the game, with each unique animal offering new forms of movement through land, sea and sky. A new set of elite specializations were also added for each class. Living World Season 4 followed afterwards, focusing on the dragon Aurene as she reached maturity and dealing with the remaining threats in Elona: Kralkatorrik, and Palawa Joko.</p><p>When Season 4 finished in May 2019, ArenaNet moved immediately into Living World Season 5, known as "The Icebrood Saga", dealing with Jormag and a new threat arising from the charr horde. During a livestream celebrating the 8th anniversary of Guild Wars 2, a third expansion, "End of Dragons", was finally announced, promising a return to the highly requested Cantha.</p><hr><h2>This game contains examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#-B&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: There are a lot of loose threads in both the personal story and even some odd strands from back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a>. However, a couple of these have returned later on. It's implied that some will be resolved in the living story. Here's a sample of ones that might not be picked up.<ul><li> A fairly minor one &mdash; after reaching a certain level in the charr story, Smodur the Unflinching will mail you that he is going to keep track of your progress. However, as the game progresses, you will never heard anything from him. It's Rytlock who will actually mail you throughout the story instead of him. It was probably intended that the sender was supposed to be Rytlock and not Smodur, but it's still not corrected.</li><li> Another charr-related one &mdash; if you decided to spare your father in the quest related to "honorless gladium" background information, he will say that he will keep in touch with you. He never shows up again nor even writes you a letter.</li><li> One of the second possible Sylvari story arcs has you work with a pair of Wardens Carys and Tegwen. In a later arc, one of the options you're given is to seek assistance from the very same Wardens, because they have been to Orr before (in the first arc, you join them in that trip). It's not quite an aborted arc, but it is aborted as "your" arc. Resulting in a very awkward scene for the player as they view a scene that seems generalised to work with anyone's story. Those two show up much later once more when the player plans to attack an Eye of Zhaitan and decides to trap it, resulting in another re-introduction of the characters for players who did not meet them before.</li><li> Another sylvari storyline involves meeting another sylvari named Malyck. He is apparently born from a different tree, and ends his arc by going off to find it and his brothers and sisters born from it. Most believed he would return during Heart of Thorns, when we go deep into the Maguuma Jungle to kill Mordremoth, but he never appears, nor do any other "Pale Trees", as this was apparently cut for time.</li><li> Eir went into the Ascalonian Catacombs to retrieve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Magdaer</a>, reforge it and give it to Logan in an attempt to remake Destiny's Edge.

When you finish the order quests, your tasks don't really pop back up. In general, all personal story arcs outside of Zhaitan lasts for about 10 levels or 3-4 instanced zones, after which it is wrapped and forgotten, no matter what the epilogue might suggest.</li><li> One instance in Orr manages to have <em>three</em> possible dropped threads. You have the options of obtaining a map from the ghost of Romke and his crew or performing a ritual at the Cathedral of Silence with Priestess Rhie and an Asuran krewe. Depending on the choices you made creating your character, as a norn, Romke might be your ancestor, as a human, you might have worked with Rhie to save Queen Jennah from Kellach, or as an asura, this might be your Snaff Prize krewe. <em>None</em> of them will acknowledge you in any way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementMockery">Achievement Mockery</a>: A few of the achievements fall into this category, such as the one for standing in the wrong place when a dragon attacks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementSystem">Achievement System</a>: The Achievement tab of the Hero Panel keeps track of most achievements available in the game.

A sylvari will meet Trahearne early on in its story, and will know all about his research. Once you join an order, this is all explained again when you 'meet' Trahearne again. Of course, this example in particular is relaxed slightly with a bonus cutscene between the sylvari PC and Trahearne.<ul><li> This is particularly egregious if you're playing as a norn: in one high-level personal story mission, Trahearne explains norn memorial customs, instructing the player on how to properly eulogize a fallen compatriot.

Thieves Guild and Ambush for Thief, clones for Mesmers, turrets for Engineers, minions for Necromancers, elementals for Elementalists, pets and spirits for Rangers. Warriors are the odd man out, summoning Banners that just give buffs to the party instead of AI-controlled units.</li><li> The elite racial skills for asura, charr, human and sylvari can also summon attack drones. Asura can summon an autonomous golem, charr call upon their warband mates, sylvari summon a druid (an ancient wood spirit creature), and humans summon two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound">Hounds of Balthazar</a> for the player as attack drones.</li><li> And just to round out the list, anyone who pre-purchased the game, or later purchased the Deluxe edition, has an elite skill unlocked for all characters on their account that lets them summon a spirit wolf.</li><li> As of the Heart of Thorns expansion, engineers can, after unlocking their elite specialization, have small, steampunk helicopter drones follow them around that provide various functions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever</a>: Some of the bosses are <em>huge</em>!

Every transformation is worth a pick. It also grants a hard-to-remove stability and one sellingpoint to make a better job at some aspect in a combat. The Tornado gives a powerful AoE-knockback, the Plague is incredibly durable, since it can also blind an enemy in vicinity, the Lich gives access to an immensely strong and piercing auto-attack and the Juggernaut is a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkOut">Hulk Out</a>, that makes the character a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>.

Additionally, at times, Dreamers can receive visions of important events or people in their future in the form of symbols, such as the first chapter of the Sylvari Personal Story.

Alas, most of them are in ruins after the last 250 years. Indeed, the whole region of the far Southern Shiverpeaks, which was downright arctic in the days of the first game, is now verdant forest, shading to jungle and swamp in places, and dominated by a huge volcano, Mount Maelstrom.</li><li> The cemetery of Ebonhawke houses the graves of some Ebon Vanguard veterans, who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> in <em>Eye Of The North</em>. Gwen has a rather prominent memorial. Nicholas Sandford and Professor Yakkington are also buried here.</li><li> The Ascalon Settlement in northern Kryta is now a major fortress on the front line of the war against the centaurs. Nebo Village just to its west, which was a tiny hamlet in the first game, has now become an important town and is also a major human-centaur battlefield. The area in which both towns are situated, Gendarran Fields, was North Kryta Province in the time of the original game and was heavily forested in those days, in contrast to its modern status with numerous farms, orchards and estates.</li><li> In-game continuity: The floating grizwhirl of the human circus storyline is mentioned offhandedly as an Inquest invention in the Asura Synergetics storyline.</li><li> Similarly, the steam creatures menacing the Lake of Lamentation are a creation of an alternate future evil version of the player character if the player is an Asura who created an Infinity Ball. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Season 2 implied that it was actually Scarlet Briar who made the steam creatures.</span></li><li> In Metrica Province, notes found in Oola's Lab reveal she was the one responsible for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting Zinn banished from Rata Sum.</span> At the time, it just looks like Asuran scienciopolitics as usual, since Oola mentions it offhandedly in some sarcastic notes about dealing with politicians.

Luckily for those without encyclopedic knowledge of the first game, just trying all possibilities until you guess right also works.</li><li> Another area has a bunch of tombstones, believed to be attributed to dwarves. Two of the tombstones are for "Little Thom" and "Reyna", human henchmen in the first game. Getting these wrong, though, are quite dangerous.<ul><li> The area in question itself is a callback: it's the Granite Citadel, where some of the original prestige armors could be crafted.</li></ul></li><li> In the Iron Marches, your character will meet a Durmand Priory scholar named Aimee Testibrie, who is looking for artifacts related to her great-grandfather, Kilnn Testibrie (whose scattered armor was the bonus objective of an early mission in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a>: Prophecies.) Not far away in the same area, your character will come upon the very cauldron that was used in the Searing of Ascalon; a dynamic event has you fighting the Flame Legion to stop them from performing a similar ritual, using that cauldron, on a nearby charr village.</li><li> Blazeridge Steppes contains the remains of several areas that were important stops in the early going for <em>Guild Wars: Prophecies</em> characters.</li><li> In Timberline Falls (which occupies the general area where the region called Snake Dance was in the first game), the ruins of Camp Rankor &mdash; which was, in the original Guild Wars, the first southern outpost of the famous/notorious "Droknar's Forge run" &mdash; are now a Durmand Priory archaeological excavation site, and the location of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a key step in your character's Personal Story, where he/she and Trahearne must rescue members of that Priory expedition from an onslaught of Risen</span>.</li><li> North of Timberline Falls, Lornar's Pass, which still retains its Prophecies-era name, is still the main highway to the southern Shiverpeaks, though nowadays it's much more heavily settled, mostly by norn in their southward migrations, and is also the home of the Durmand Priory. The out-of-the-way shrine to Grenth, which could be visited by players in Prophecies days, is still there.</li><li> Dredgehaunt Cliffs, to the east of Lornar's Pass and south of Hoelbrak, hosts not only the Granite Citadel but the dungeon which was once known as Sorrow's Furnace and is now called Sorrow's Embrace.</li><li> The Temple of the Ages, once a key outpost in the jungles of central Kryta and a gateway to the Underworld and the Fissure of Woe, is now, like Camp Rankor, a collection of ruins being explored by the Durmand Priory. It's still highly dangerous because it continues to be plagued by creatures which keep leaking through portals from the Underworld, including the formidable Shadow Behemoth. Fortunately, the undead which used to infest the surrounding areas have long since vanished, though they've had their places taken by bandit gangs and centaurs.</li><li> Sparkfly Swamp, the location of two dungeons in Eye of the North, is now Sparkfly Fen. The dungeons have long since vanished, but the area is a key part of the front line in the struggle between the Pact and Zhaitan and his Risen minions, particularly since it's the haunt of Tequatl the Sunless.</li><li> The "Ruins of the Unseen" location in Caledon Forest is the same location near the old asura outpost of Vlox's Falls; Caledon Forest itself occupies much of what was Arbor Bay, plus several coastal zones to the north. The Grove, the sylvari home city, is built on the site of the centaur Ventari's old settlement in Arbor Bay.</li><li> Kessex Hills, north of Caledon Forest, occupies more or less the same area that was called Kessex Peak 250 years ago, and includes the Wizard's Tower, which floated off the southwestern edge of the area in those days but has now been moved by its current owner to a location outside the village of Garrenhoff, at the southeastern corner of the area.</li><li> Shaemoor, the village/suburb outside Divinity's Reach where human characters kick off their adventures, was the site of a mission location in <em>Guild Wars: Prophecies</em>. Divinity's Reach itself, the human player's home city and the capital of the kingdom of Kryta, is built on the site of the old village of Divinity's Coast (the objective the players were supposed to reach in the aforementioned mission), and the area to its immediate west, a heavily overgrown jungle with only minimal paths in the time of Guild Wars 1, is now thoroughly cultivated and occupied by numerous farms.</li><li> To the east of Divinity's Reach, Beetletun, an outpost in <em>Guild Wars: Prophecies</em>, is now one of the most important towns in Queensdale, the seat of Queen Jennah's rival Lord Caudecus, and the site of a dungeon.</li><li> Yak's Bend, once a key stop on the road for refugees and adventurers from Ascalon on their way to Kryta, has been reduced to a minor waypoint in southeastern Frostgorge Sound, occupied mainly by Priory researchers and local grawl tribes. The Iron Horse Mines to the west, once a major dwarven community, have long since been taken over by dredge.</li><li> The Silverwastes, added November 2014, while now arid desert, was once the lush jungle/forest known as the Silverwood in <em>Guild Wars: Prophecies</em>. Artifacts found at the old forts in the area indicate that those facilities may have at one time been occupied by the White Mantle, whether during their period of power in Kryta or while fleeing their defeat in that kingdom's civil war. The fortress known as Indigo Cave, in the center of the area, occupies more or less the same position as the old Shining Blade outpost known as Quarrel Falls.

Norn are called the Slayer of Issormir (or just Slayer, for short) for their part in the Great Hunt. Asura are called Savant in recognition of winning the Snaff Prize. Sylvari are called Valiant, which in their society is a title given to those born with a Wyld Hunt. Charr are referred to by their military rank, starting with Soldier, then Legionnaire, and later, Centurion.

On one hand, given that their <em>entire race</em> is barely 25 years old and that they're living plants, they are honestly alien to the world, and they operate on a sort of fairy tale logic wherein everyone "born" by the Pale Tree gets his destiny and his lifegoal revealed shortly afterwards &mdash; naturally, the player characters is to slay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zhaitan</a>.

Charr hate humans. Norn distrust humans and consider them cowardly. The asura consider everyone else irredeemably stupid and the sylvari to be especially idiotic.<ul><li> Of course while the human, charr, and norn relationship can be a bit icy, the asura-sylvari relationship is milked for all the comedy it's worth. Since the asura think themselves above everyone and the sylvari are almost literally wide-eyed children, a lot of the "racism" comes across as schoolyard bullying, such as comparing a ditzy Warden to a salad.</li><li> Similarly, some races tend to be actually friendly if not tolerable to one another. Charr and norn tend to respect each other due to their ways of viewing one's worth being similar, and the Iron Legion side of the charr like to trade technology with the asura, who have been heard praising their work.</li><li> Also, while the asura consider everyone beneath them, they hate the skritt. Before Primordus drove them to the surface, the asura attempted genocide on the skritt, though they prefer the term "extermination". This is motivated by several factors, including concerns over their explosive population growth, irritation over their theft of asuran technology, anger over their ability to only recreate or modify existing technology, and a secret rage over large groups of skritt being smarter than asura. Though it should be noted that in game this hatred for skritt is far from universal. Many asura are content to simply study or exploit the presence of skritt, and a few even use them as assistants for menial tasks.</li><li> Centaurs have a deep-seated hatred of humans, which they have extended to include all two-legged races. The humans return the hatred, having spent centuries dealing with their raids.</li><li> As of <em>Heart of Thorns</em>, characters of all races consider sylvari to be untrustworthy at best. Almost justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the sylvari are constantly in danger of falling to Mordremoth's corruption</span>, but there are plenty who don't, and they're treated with suspicion regardless of their contribution. Even high-ranking officials (including you, if you're playing a sylvari) face open disrespect from their subordinates.</li><li> The Commander really hates Joko and his Awakened forces. When entering Vabbi, an Order of Shadows agent has to explain not to kill all the Awakened on sight because you can't just forcibly liberate the Vabbians that way. This is gradually further justified by the fact that Joko's treatment of the Awakened is pretty horrifying. The Boneyard is <em>full</em> of still-conscious discarded Awakened wandering about waiting to be called to serve, for example, and Joko uses Awakening for <em>torture</em> as easily as he uses it as gift. Moreover, while he claims that he gives the Awakened back to their families, he can call them back to his control and turn them into soldiers/meat-shields/suicide bombers at any moment using the very fact that they spent their lives being brainwashed by his propaganda.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlurs">Fantastic Slurs</a>: Pops up most often between the openly antagonistic races, but also present between mildly friendly races.

Because Eir had accomplished things which most norn could not hope to match, but has since refused to pursue that goal, she may be considered "old" by society (and indeed likely considers herself to be old) and thus passes her experience and wisdom to the Slayer as a result.</li><li> Take a close look at human NPCs that <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/s92Vv.jpg">are labeled as Old Women<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.

A lot of the time, supposed "allies" accompanying you in a mission won't react to enemies attacking you at all and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">will stand around gormlessly picking their noses while you get assaulted by waves of monsters</a> while shouting desperate warnings (the enemy will ignore them too to focus on you).

Different from most examples of the trope in that an engineer trying to emulate another class's strength generally isn't any <em>weaker</em> than the profession it's emulating, just less reliable, more situational, and/or harder to use; for example, an engineer using the Bomb Kit and a trait to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">heal allies with bomb blasts</a> can pull off a Guardian's "heal nearby allies while dishing out consistent melee-range damage" schtick very effectively, but the delay between placing a bomb and its detonation makes it impractical for use against quick-moving casters, unless the engineer can predict his/her target's movements and drop bombs in its path with perfect anticipation.<ul><li> The Ranger also competes for being the most Jack-like in spirit of the GW 1 ranger who was almost as varied any GW 2 profession. While the Engineer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> from his delightfully random and diverse set of tools, the Ranger is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> thanks to their pet. Their pet is a very significant portion of their damage, so they personally do less damage than other professions, but are still just as capable of filling all roles. Since a ranger's build usually doesn't affect their Pet's fighting style, a Ranger isn't punished for choosing a pet that fills in for their own shortcomings, but each is sort of like a half person making them together a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>.</li><li> Guardians themselves aren't slouches, and while they have a slightly narrower purview (ranged caster, healer, bubble mage, and tank) they double-down on the versatility with spells that summon extra weapons, allowing them to spontaneously switch between more than the usual two weapon sets, and thus change roles, without exiting combat at all.</li><li> While not a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> out of the caster classes that in general provide a ton of utility, the Necromancers stick out a lot being able to take conditions of all allies and sending em to one enemy or eat them to heal themself (or create the second highest AoE heal area for their allies that purges conditions of them if they shoot stuff through it), to share conditions from the said enemy to all around him and then turn into a death cloud that heals allies around themself and then again healing upon exiting the form on a pretty regular basis, but even so every class can fall under it if built that way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>: Pretty much the asura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a>- it's extremely rare of to find one who isn't self-centered, arrogant, outright rude, or at least a bit snarky (although they do exist, such as Tonn the Demolitionist and his wife Ceera the Medic).

Unfortunately, due to the nature of Season 1, there is no practical way to add any of this content back into the game, though Anet was able to compromise by adding an optional event that shows the main important events of Season 1 via flashbacks, as well as exposition on several major characters who debuted in that Season.

Unlike in the first game, however, such "map travel" now costs a fee, which is generally quite small but varies according to the distance the player would like to travel, and also scales with the player's level. There are also "Asura Gates" available in the major cities which can be used to travel between said cities (Lion's Arch is the central node of this network, so in order to travel, say, from the Black Citadel to Hoelbrak, you will need to go through Lion's Arch, much as air travelers often have to go through a "hub city" and change planes in order to reach their destinations).<ul><li> With the addition of guild halls, players can be instantly transported there at any time they are not dead.
