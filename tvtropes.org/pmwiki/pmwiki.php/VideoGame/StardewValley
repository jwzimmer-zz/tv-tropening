An acknowledged inspiration for the game is early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons">Harvest Moon</a></em>, and as a result it feels and plays a lot like it, though it also has some additional gameplay elements like a crafting system and co-op play. The combat elements also give it a hint of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em>, which has both farming and combat as well.</p><p>The story starts with the Player Character's grandfather dying. They've left them an envelope and advised they wait to open it until they are at their most depressed... Skipping to XX years later, sitting alone in your work cubicle at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness">Joja Corporation</a>, you have indeed sunk into a deep depression, feeling as if your life has become meaningless routine. You open the envelope and discover that you've been left a plot of land and a run-down old farm in Pelican Town in Stardew Valley. There's also a vast network of caves nearby, where players can go spelunking and fighting monsters in search of loot and artifacts, similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarvestMoonDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarvestMoonDS">Harvest Moon DS</a></em>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>But even now you can't get away from the Joja Corporation, as the town has recently opened a new JojaMart, and it has already begun threatening local businesses, polluting the area, vying for more land, crushing spirits and probably performing satanic rituals too. You can side with the town and revitalize the economy, making friends and giving gifts, or you can side with Joja, focus on money, and redevelop the town at the price of other local businesses' success.</p><p>The game started development in 2012, was officially Greenlit on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> on May 16, 2013, and was fully released on February 26th, 2016.</p><p>You can buy it for Windows/Mac/Linux <a class="urllink" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/413150">on Steam<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gog.com/game/stardew_valley">on GOG.com<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

You can store fruits, veggies, fish, etc. for <em>years</em>, and they will never go bad.</li><li> Milk and egg producing animals are capable of breeding despite the apparent lack of any male of their species.</li><li> The Greenhouse can simultaneously grow plants from every season despite the vastly different growing conditions most plants require which prevent them growing at the same time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamSmithHatesYourGuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamSmithHatesYourGuts">Adam Smith Hates Your Guts</a>:<ul><li> The traveling merchant can sell rare and exotic items, including some very hard-to-find crops, furniture and seeds. However, the prices vary wildly, and can be outrageously expensive compared to their value. The prices also start increasing the further along you get.</li><li> While JojaMart claims to have low prices, everything there is always more expensive than the mom-and-pop store in town. This can be somewhat explained because of the 50% off coupons Morris hands out, however since you don't take the coupons you're not granted that discount.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: For a relatively cutesy-looking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em> expy, Stardew Valley's inhabitants have some pretty mature issues to deal with:<ul><li> Your protagonist was trapped in the horror and isolation of the Joja Corporation's cubicle rat race, with no way out until their late-Grandfather's farm gave them an escape.</li><li> Shane is trapped in a similar path as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulSuckingRetailJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulSuckingRetailJob">shelf-monkey in the aisles of Joja-Mart</a>, and he's falling apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcoholism to deal with his depression</a>, causing both Marnie and Jas to worry a lot for him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He attempts suicide at one point.</span></li><li> Jas, as an orphan, only has Shane and Marnie to be her family, and is sometimes neglected due to their worklife and personal issues. She has some serious worries about Shane's depression, and has witnessed his drunken ranting at least once, which has traumatized her.<ul><li> A subtle hint found in Jas' room indicates that she may have been abused by her grandfather - a possible reason why she now lives with Marnie.</li></ul></li><li> Several villagers are dealing with very mundane and real personal issues, from family tensions to worries about their future.</li><li> Leah left the city for the country because she was escaping an abusive ex who didn't support her dream to be an artist.</li><li> Lewis refuses to make his relationship with Marnie public because he says it would affect his authority as Mayor - even though there's nothing scandalous about it and they're both mature and single adults. Instead, he strings her along, keeping their affair a secret and depriving her of the companionship she really wants.</li><li> Sebastian has literally become a basement dweller just to stay away from his family. Demetrius seems to dislike him and wants Maru to stay away from him and Robin does nothing to fix this situation. The only people in town he appears to like are Sam and Abigail.</li><li> Alex might seem like a stereotypical airheaded jock, but he had a physically and emotionally abusive father who eventually walked out on his family. After that, Alex's mother passed away and he moved in with his grandparents.</li><li> Penny has self-esteem issues from living in a trailer with her alcoholic mother, and their relationship has gotten soured by the closure of the town bus, which left Pam jobless and with nothing to do but getting drunk at the saloon, which (as you can witness yourself) makes her aggressive, which she takes out on Penny.</li><li> Kent is shown to have PTSD after returning to the Valley from his stint in the Army. While it's clear that he and Jodi care for each other, there is some tension in that he has difficulty re-adjusting to civilian life after his stint as a POW, while she has some regrets about getting married and becoming a mother too early in her life.</li><li> There are some dialogue hints that all is not necessarily well in Demetrius and Robin's marriage, and ConcernedApe originally planned for Robin to be a romanceable character. Which would naturally require breaking up Robin and Demetrius to do it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: The auto-name generator for animals offers random syllables to form a name.

Morris seems particularly eager to get the farmer to join them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalGemPolish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalGemPolish">All-Natural Gem Polish</a>: The geodes you can dig up somehow contain perfectly cut and polished gems.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a>: JojaCorp is hinted to be polluting Stardew Valley and is portrayed as soul crushing to work for, but is otherwise very fill-in-the-blank when it comes to everything else. Aside from it being left to the imagination what siding with them would entail in the long run, just the nature of the company itself is ambiguous. It's presumably a top tier soda producer like Coke/Pepsi, but it's also a big box chain and internet provider. In the opening scene it looks like any white collar environment &mdash; allowing the player to fill in just about anything that applies to them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>: Completing some events can result in hats, which are aesthetic. One example is winning the Easter egg hunt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnEconomyIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnEconomyIsYou">An Economy Is You</a>: Justified, since you're running the only local farm in town. Since JojaMart moved into town, it's damaged the local economy. NPCs go in and out of the local shops and will comment on them, and you can examine items on shelves. Shane works at the JojaMart.

However Hops use a trellis which limits crop placement and require far more micromanagement due to their daily harvest and short brewing times. Most players will instead stick with the simpler and less labor-intensive wine crops.</li><li> Hatching a Dinosaur Egg in your coop to raise your own dinosaur is awesome but the dinosaur itself is underwhelming. It eats as much as the other coop animals but only produces one egg per week which generates a much smaller profit than a chicken's constant egg production. The ability to turn them into dinosaur mayonnaise added in patch 1.4 alleviates this somewhat, as it's the most valuable type of mayonnaise.</li><li> You can use casks to upgrade cheese and Keg items to Iridium quality, doubling their value...but the process takes a long time, with cheese taking about a week and wine taking <em>two months</em> to reach that point.

Eggs are used in a number of dishes and mayonnaise is a good gift for most of the town. Milk can be converted into cheese, an efficient food for recovering health and energy without losing any food buffs.</li><li> The most reliable way to get to the desert is to just pay 500 gold to take the bus. It only runs from 10 AM to 5 PM with return trips available any time, but the driver is there 111 days a year out of 112 and all the alternate methods of getting to the desert require rare resources, such as Iridium.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>:<ul><li> If you sell out the community center to JojaMart and buy every available upgrade, Morris gives you a vending machine that produces Joja Cola. Not really all that useful, since everyone in town but one person hates the soda, it doesn't even restore that much energy, and sells for cheap. Also, you'll miss out on the other smaller rewards that completing the bundles would give you, and the "Friendship" reward that boosts all of your affection rating with every villager by two hearts becomes unavailable. But hey, free soda!</li><li> The secret buildings. If you complete the quest for the wizard to enter the witch's hut, he unlocks several buildings you can place on your farm. These buildings might be nominally useful if they didn't cost so much money and resources to create. The warp pillars for the mountains and the beach each cost 500 thousand gold (one million prior to 1.5) in addition to the other resources needed to craft them. And while instantaneous warping is nice, it's to pass over a minor inconvenience, and it's possible to create Totems that do the same thing which can be used anywhere. Desert and island pillars are added later on and cost a million and some resources, mainly serving to skip paying a fare while their respective Totems will, again, serve the same purpose.</li><li> The Golden Clock is the most "bragging rights" of these buildings. In addition to requiring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">Double Unlock</a> by first completing a quest for the wizard, it's the most expensive thing in the game at ten million gold, and the only thing it does is stop debris from appearing on your farm. By the time you can earn that much money, debris is a pitiful concern.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>:<ul><li> Choosing to take up a JojaMart Membership will see to the destruction of the Community Center and replace the bundles system, where you bring various items to the spirits inhabiting the place, with directly paying money to get the same rewards. This inevitably results in a farm that revolves almost entirely around making money. It's a lot easier, and a lot more expensive. Naturally, this is thematically and mechanically discouraged, as Joja effectively serves as the underlying antagonist to the game and losing the Community Center will lock you out of a lot of potential rewards.</li><li> The staircase item is also this. It allows you to descend one floor in the mines, at the cost of 99 stone. Theoretically, you could store up masses of stone in advance, build dozens of staircases, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">bypass the mines completely</a>.</li><li> At the Stardew Valley Fair, if you don't feel like playing lots of mini-games or didn't get enough star points for your grange display, you can just buy star points at 50 gold per point.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: During the Stardew Valley Fair, Willy will comment that Mayor Lewis doesn't seem to like fish.

Oh, and you need to make and pay a fair amount of gold to the spirits as one of their objectives, so either way you've got to put some focus on profit.</li><li> Big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness">Predatory Business</a> is bad, mmkay? Except that Joja gets results, and working with them is a faster, smoother and easier way to restore the town than trying to fix up an old community center that nobody in the town really cares about anymore.

But of note are the Vault bundles, which are completed by paying money upfront; 42,500 Gold is needed to complete all of them and access the Calico Desert. And <em>then</em> every time you want to go there, you have to pay 500 Gold to take the bus, or use Desert Warp Totems which must be bought for 3 Omni Geodes each or crafted, and the crafting recipe itself costs <em>ten Iridium Bars</em> and each crafted Totem uses even more Iridium alongside other ingredients.</li><li> Buying a Joja membership to replace the Community Center with the Joja Warehouse turns the bundle system into this.

Several tools, when upgraded, use the "hold" type charge, which will increase the AOE, decreasing both stamina and time usage to achieve a particular goal.

Many characters are either <em>from</em> the city or express a desire to leave the Valley to go and live there.

Even the friendlier sorts aren't particularly inclined to chat for long at first, and you'll probably be spending the first Flower Dance observing, as you're not close enough to anyone to participate. Later in the game, if you get married, the Mayor will admit he had concerns as to whether you'd ever fit in. The only characters that seem to be instantly friendly are Robin and Pierre.

The winter season forces you to go 28 days without access to crops other than Winter Wild Seeds, thus limiting your means of income and food. Any fruit trees you've planted will persist, but none of them will grow fruit. This can be circumvented with a greenhouse which can grow out-of-season crops and trees, but it's very hard to get one in your first year. You also can't grow grass and thus your animals will rely solely on hay during this season, nor can you get honey from beehives.

Sebastian mentions multiple times that Demetrius doesn't like him and that he feels like Maru is the preferred child of both Robin and Demetrius and despises her for that.

Yet George complains (especially in summer) that is disability makes it impossible for him to play with Alex, and Evelyn suffers from George's bad health as well as the loss of her daughter.

All of the bachelors and bachelorettes tend to be sorted into "mating pairs" but none of them ever into a proper relationship in order to remain available for the player character:<ul><li> Sebastian's feelings for Abigail are relatively muted (but then he's not the sort of character who makes grand romantic gestures anyway), but he <em>does</em> draft her to join Sam's band, and if you marry either Maru or Sam, both of them will muse that they think the two of them should get together.</li><li> Haley has a blatantly obvious crush on Alex and often follows him around; despite otherwise being girl-crazy, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a> and never notices.</li><li> Harvey (the town doctor) and Maru (his nurse) seem to have a strictly professional relationship, but if you marry Penny (her best friend), she'll comment that there's something between them&#133; but Maru is going to have to make the first move.</li><li> Elliot and Leah often drink together at the Stardrop Saloon; both are similar personality-wise, loner creative types who live in solitude (they're the only bachelors who live and work alone).</li><li> Shane and Emily tend to recruit each other for their creative projects, and are oddly quite cordial toward each other for having such diametrically opposed personalities.<ul><li> Notably, Shane and Emily were <em>not</em> romanceable when the game was first released. They were made available as partners together thanks to fan feedback.</li></ul></li><li> Ironically it's Sam and Penny, who are otherwise seldom seen together, who have the most blatant reciprocal interactions of any of the bachelor pairs, though you only learn about this once you start getting serious with Penny, when Vincent comments he saw the two of them climbing trees together. (ConcernedApe, despite his usual tendency to invite player interpretation of events, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/4b8s7v/im_concernedape_developer_of_stardew_valley_ask/d16zqdf/">made the point of defending her honor and insists nothing serious happened<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsEasy">Evil Is Easy</a>: The community center is a long-term project that requires you to put a lot of effort into doing stuff in every arena of the game to rebuild Pelican Town. The Joja Community Development Program will turn the community center into a warehouse, and then let you buy the upgrades as soon as you can come up with the dough, which a good farm will make far more quickly than they'll get that fishing or greenhouse bundle finished. Who needs some old junimos, anyway?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>:<ul><li> The bath house. Described by ConcernedApe as such: "Fun setting for events, place to relax, and <strong>an excuse to see characters in their bathing suits</strong>."</li><li> The beach resort in the 1.5 update is a better example, where after you get it built, villagers actually will show up and change into swimsuits to hang out at the beach.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a>:<ul><li> Some of the notices on the notice board by Pierre's shop have an NPC needing a certain item within at latest two days. Doing these can give you favor with that NPC.</li><li> Some special weekly missions revolve around fetching a certain amount of items. In most cases, the items must be delivered to certain spots. Players will be rewarded with crafting recipes or some other item that makes farm life easier.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A woman in Ginger Island seeks a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake">Tragic Keepsake</a> from her departed husband, and gives you a photo that has washed up to start the fetch chain going.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalSport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalSport">Fictional Sport</a>: Gridball, which so strongly resembles American football (also known as <em>gridiron</em> football) that it might as well just be an alternate name for it. Zuzu City has a professional gridball team, the Tunnelers, and several of the NPCs are fans. Alex even dreams of playing for them someday, and if you get close enough to Shane, he'll take you to a Tunnelers game. (They apparently aren't very popular, since a guy working a minimum-wage job was able to get two <em>front-row</em> tickets and the stadium is half-empty.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForSole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForSole">Fishing for Sole</a>: Anything from trash bags to unopened cans of JojaCola (which is in-game categorized as trash). Oddly enough, they still use up bait.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame">Fishing Minigame</a>: After responding to the fish tug, the minigame is then pulled up. In a sense, the player has to play an endurance 2D version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissileLockOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissileLockOn">Missile Lock-On</a> with a tug-o-war style progression. While the lock is maintained, the player gradually gets closer to catching the fish while lessening the fish's escape progression. On the other hand, failing to maintain it will not only hurt the player's progression, but also increases the fish's escape progression. Random treasure may also be included and will only be gotten if <strong>both</strong> the treasure and fish are caught. There are two proper minigames of the same sort during two of the festivals, but you don't get to keep the fish.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>: There's a line of dialogue from Jodi in which she warns you that if you're not careful, all traces of your old lifestyle will be wiped away once you get married. In the original version of the game, this happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">several of the love interests if you marry them, including her own son, Sam (who loses all interest in his music), and Sebastian (who decides that his beloved motorbike is too dangerous for a family man to have around)</span>. In contrast, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abigail seems to take the opportunity to realize her dream of being an adventurer; she will randomly mention on some mornings that she went adventuring for a bit, and will give you some monster drops. She will also occasionally give you bombs and buffing food to help your adventuring along.</span> The 1.1 update has alleviated some of this. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a married Sebastian has apparently changed his mind about his motorbike, as he now keeps it in your shared backyard and can be seen working on it from time to time, and Sam's private room contains his keyboard.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromMyOwnPersonalGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromMyOwnPersonalGarden">From My Own Personal Garden</a>: You can give produce as gifts or as your contribution to the Luau. Of course, as you're a farmer, this is completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> and not a sign of any kind of villainy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pierre can also <em>claim</em> this when reselling <em>your</em> stuff</span>.<ul><li> Befriending Shane and Jodi will make them sometimes send you crops that they say they grew in their own gardens.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNewYorkToNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNewYorkToNowhere">From New York to Nowhere</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> is from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCity">The City</a>, but after suffering at a soul-sucking desk job, they decide to leave everything behind to take over their grandpa's old farm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromStrayToPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromStrayToPet">From Stray to Pet</a>: Your pet is a stray found by Marnie.

During the concert,</span> Linus can be seen investigating a nearby dumpster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Fun with Acronyms</a>: A TV channel that can be unlocked via Special Orders is abbreviated F.I.B.S., short for Fishing Information Broadcasting Service.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>:<ul><li> The Playstation 4 Pro can be corrupted if it's put into sleep mode while running the game. Notable in that it's <em>only</em> the Pro - the vanilla and Slim versions don't suffer from this. Turns out this was Sony's fault and was addressed in a system update.</li><li> In all versions of the game, there is a bug where if you buy an item from any shop with a full inventory, you cannot place the bought item in your inventory. You also can't empty anything from your inventory. There is no way to cancel or refund this transaction. Doing this leaves you with no way to get out of the shop menu except for closing the game, which means that you lose the current day's progress and have to start the day over again.</li><li> In a strange, inexplicable bug that even the creator of the game is having difficulty finding the cause of, Pam can randomly disappear from the game. Not only does this mean that the player will not be able to befriend her, it also means that, if she disappears before the player restores the bus to the Calico Desert, they will be completely unable to go there. This prevents the player from ever being able to meet Sandy, get to the Casino, find desert-exclusive collectibles, and explore the Skull Cavern.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameGourmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameGourmet">Game Gourmet</a>: Basically, all your crops are edible. Food available includes various types of fruit, vegetables, mushrooms, flowers, fish and animal products. There are also a variety of processed goods, like beverages, mayonnaise, cheese, as well as a range of cooked goods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a>: A number of mods have been made since the release of the game, ranging from making fishing easier/harder to pet replacements to more music to redone character portraits to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePerversityPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePerversityPotential">the inevitable nude mods</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>:<ul><li> Despite the player being repeatedly informed that JojaMart's "low prices" are threatening to drive Pierre out of business, JojaMart's items are all more <em>expensive</em> than Pierre's store (presumably for balance purposes, since JojaMart, unlike Pierre's, is open from 9 AM to 11 PM 7 days a week). Even if the player purchases the Joja Membership, prices simply become the same. However, in a cutscene we learn that Joja can afford to do things like give away 50% discount vouchers right in Pierre's shop. This could be explained as the things you aren't shopping for being much cheaper, however.</li><li> Earlier versions of the game had it so that if the player <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">causes the JojaMart to shut down by restoring the Community Center</span>, Shane would still go to "work" there every day. This issue was fixed in a patch.</li><li> Regardless of your spouse's supposed intelligence, due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I. Roulette</a> nature when they "help" out on the farm, they are all apparently incapable of understanding how a sprinkler works (they water the plants next to them anyway) or that your upgraded barn/coop has an automated feeding system (claiming they've fed the animals). Justifiable to a degree for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Haley</a>, but not for the rest of them. Especially Shane has no excuses, considering he lived on Marnie's farm until marriage and was raising chickens of his own while doing so.</li><li> Both Sam's eight-heart event and Shane's ten-heart event make use of the bus, even if it hasn't been repaired yet through the Community Center.</li><li> It is possible for your spouse to tell you they'll remain indoors during a rainy day...only to see them visiting the beach resort later on the same day.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation">Gameplay Automation</a>:<ul><li> Sprinklers will automatically water surrounding tiles every morning, saving the player time and energy. Higher-quality sprinklers water more surrounding tiles but require increasingly scarce resources.</li><li> You can buy an Auto-Grabber item that, when placed in a barn or coop, will harvest resources from animals residing in the same building every morning and hold them for you. However, it costs 25,000 gold, and it cannot collect truffles (that pigs find) because truffles are only found outdoors.</li><li> If you're married, your spouse may water crops for you.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam">Gathering Steam</a>:<ul><li> Plants that grow multiple crops without the need to replant them are this. Like every plant they need to grow to their full size first. But then they regrow their crops every couple of days, until they die at the end of their season (unless planted in a greenhouse, which makes them regrow forever, or if they are fruit trees that only become inactive out of season).</li><li> Fruit trees produce crops with increasing quality the older the tree is. Bringing one up to iridium quality requires <em>three</em> in-game years.</li><li> When a new animal is born, or bought from Marnie, it first needs to grow up before it can produce its goods. Increasing friendship with the animal, which takes several weeks, also improves the quality of the good and adjusts drops for some animals.<ul><li> Cows, goats, and chickens upgrade their products to Large versions which are worth more and the only way to produce gold cheese and mayonnaise.</li><li> Rabbits and ducks increase the chance of them dropping their more valuable rare item, rabbit's feet and feathers, instead of their standard drop.</li><li> Sheep can be sheared more frequently as friendship increases, going from once every three days to daily.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">Gay Option</a>: Rectifying a common criticism of the <em>Harvest Moon</em> games, same-sex relationships (and marriages) are possible. There are twelve total eligible love interests &mdash; six men and six women. The player can romance any of them, regardless of what gender their farmer is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a>: At the beginning of every morning, a rooster crows, even if there are no chickens on the farm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrencyException" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrencyException">Global Currency Exception</a>: Instead of gold, the Fall Festival Fair stall requires you to use tickets, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the casino requires Qi tokens.</span><ul><li> The desert merchant added in 1.4 will only accept various resources and rare items, such as Iridium Bars and Omni Geodes.</li><li> Version 1.5 added Golden Walnuts, which are used to unlock new areas and various services on Ginger Island, The Island Trader, which only accepts various resources like the Desert Merchant, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Qi's Walnut Room, where you can spend Qi Gems on rare and powerful late-game items.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">Gotta Catch Them All</a>:<ul><li> Inverted. A compendium of items will slowly become unlocked as you <strong>sell</strong> the item in question. Which you first need to collect/catch.</li><li> Played straight with the "Rarecrows", 8 collectible scarecrows available to unlock or purchase from certain events. Collecting them all will earn you the Deluxe Scarecrow, which has twice the range of any other scarecrow.</li><li> Played literally straight with the fish (you need to actually catch them in order for them to show up on the collections screen; finding them elsewhere such as picking up shells on the beach don't count) and the artifacts (which also need to be donated to the museum). Completing either awards you a Stardrop.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>: A whole lot of basic but convenient functions are never explained.<ul><li> Upgraded watering cans and hoes can be used to affect larger areas: copper affects 1x3 squares, steel is 1x5, gold is 3x3 and iridium is 6x3.</li><li> Holding the Shift key while right-clicking on an item modifies how much of an item is selected. For an item in the inventory/chest, half of the items are taken. For an item in a shop, the item is purchased five at a time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a>:<ul><li> The Dwarves and Shadow People have only recently ended the Elemental War, a thousand year long conflict which has left both sides bitter. Based on the conversation between Krobus and the Dwarf, the Shadow People launched the first attack in response to the Dwarves forcing them out of their homeland.</li><li> Stardew Valley is located in the Ferngill Republic which is currently at war with the Gotoro Empire across the sea. It is mostly mentioned in passing with the most direct references being related to Kent, a soldier who spent time as a prisoner of war.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a>: There's a heavy vibe about pollution caused by big corporations, and sustainable farming. There's pretty much nothing on your farm that can't be used for something else, and you can even build a recycling machine that processes fished-up trash into useful materials.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a>: After the player is married, a spouse has a small chance to get jealous if you give a gift to another bachelor/ette, which lowers their affection rating for the player character&mdash;though the 1.1 update changed it so that your spouse will never get jealous if you give another villager a gift on their birthday.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessElectrocution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessElectrocution">Harmless Electrocution</a>: In Maru's eight-heart event, the player will be shocked with electricity from one of her experiments. Though Maru has to apply some burn cream, the player is otherwise unharmed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">Hello, [Insert Name Here]</a>: During character creation, players can name their PC, farm, and favorite thing. In addition, each new farm animal can also be named by the player, and you get to name your pet when Marnie shows up with it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingCheckpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingCheckpoint">Healing Checkpoint</a>: Going to bed for the day will restore your health and energy, and is the only way to save the game.

The main way to really discover this is through raising your affection with them, although you can also raid their bookshelves for some hints on their major life issues once you get them to two hearts. This is particularly prominent for certain characters who are outright abrasive or unpleasant at first glance, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">Shane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Haley</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestyIsTheBestPolicy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestyIsTheBestPolicy">Honesty Is the Best Policy</a>: In almost every cutscene where you have the choice to lie or tell someone else to lie, the person being lied to will see through it and lose Friendship Points as a result. Conversely, telling the truth will turn out for the best, as the other person appreciates the honesty and is willing to forgive simple accidents. In the few cases where it is better to hide the truth, it's generally because you're doing it to allow someone <em>else</em> to save face, rather than lying on your own behalf.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism">Hyperactive Metabolism</a>: Low on health/stamina?

As your character walks in, she asks for your help. You manage to open the jar, impressing her. (Your character can do it regardless of gender.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">Lava Katana</a>, which can be purchased at the Adventurer's Guild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">after reaching the bottom level of the mines</a>. It's considerably more powerful than nearly every other weapon in the game&mdash;the next-strongest sword does about half as much damage on average&mdash;although slightly less powerful than the Galaxy Sword.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>: The Galaxy Sword, and the hammer and dagger variants that go on sale after you find it. Requires you to use the rarest drop in the game in a Prismatic Shard, along with several other rare drops to be able to read an old inscription to get a clue to what do with it once you have it.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">1.5 adds a forge where you can enhance equipment.

Originally this was ten game minutes for every <em>five</em> real-time seconds (120:1 time compression) but it was slowed down after the Chucklefish pre-release stream due to widespread complaints about the pace being too rushed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a>: Collecting material allows you to craft items to use around your farm, such as fences.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou">It's Up to You</a>: While some things happen by themselves, most of the outcome is determined by the farmer. For example, the taste of the Luau's communal soup is solely based on what ingredient the farmer puts into it (being bland if none was added.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTrainWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTrainWrong">Just Train Wrong</a>:<ul><li> Railroad companies usually don't run passenger trains mixed in with freight trains. And if they did, they would try to group them together and not have passenger coaches placed randomly between freight cars like you see in the game.</li><li> One of the sound effects for a train passing by the valley is a diesel air horn, but you only ever see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamNeverDies">steam trains</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKeyIsBehindTheLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKeyIsBehindTheLock">The Key Is Behind the Lock</a>: This can become a huge hassle when trying to befriend certain townspeople. Some of them have schedules that will keep them in their rooms for most or all of the day, making them hard to find in order to befriend, and you can't go in their rooms until you have at least two hearts with them. Elliott and Sebastian are the most notorious for this, as they rarely leave their respective dwellings, and thus are very hard to make friends with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen">Killed Offscreen</a>: Farm animals that are left outside overnight have a chance to disappear; it's implied that they are killed. You don't actually see it happen; the only indicators you get are the sound of what sounds like wolves or dogs when you go to sleep, a random animal no longer on your farm, and the same mood message for all of your animals about how "it seems like something bad happened last night."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Last Lousy Point</a>: Completing the museum collection (donate 95 items) and obtaining every stardrop which requires completing said collection, on account of half the items you need to donate being entirely up to RNG whether you get it or not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler">Late-Arrival Spoiler</a>: A <em>lot</em> of them in regards to the NPCs. Pelican Town is very private and close-knit, and many characters won't tell you basic information about themselves (like Leah being a sculptor or Elliot being a writer) until you build a friendship with them, but it's hard to discuss the game in any detail without mentioning such things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid">Lava is Boiling Kool-Aid</a>: The lava lake on floor 100 of the mines kind of has this look to it. You can even fish in it! For all intents and purposes it seems to be mere water with red light reflecting off of it, as if it was literal lava it would disintegrate your fishing line, although that doesn't stop creatures called <em>Lava</em> Eels from residing in it.<ul><li> 1.5 adds an actual volcanic caldera you can both visit, and fish in to catch more of the aforementioned Lava Eels.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeFilmArtistique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeFilmArtistique">Le Film Artistique</a>: "Mysterium", one of the shows available if you unlock the movie theater, is composed of a series of bizarre scenes in black and white accompanied by cryptic narration.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalLavaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalLavaLand">Lethal Lava Land</a>: More for aesthetics than actual mechanics, but floors 80 and lower of the mine apply, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection">Convection Schmonvection</a> and a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaPit">lake of lava</a>. The 1.5 update adds a straighter example in the form of Ginger Island's Volcano Dungeon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5">Level-Up at Intimacy 5</a>: Befriending the local NPCs can net nice goodies, like new crafting recipes or goods. Certain quests also win favor with them, like getting a certain item within a time limit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpFillUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpFillUp">Level-Up Fill-Up</a>: Very quietly. If you level up a skill, you'll wake up the next day with full stamina, unaffected by the penalties for overworking or staying up late.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a>: The health meter only appears in areas where you can take damage. Much like stamina, it can be recovered by eating food. Running out of life will have a random villager bring you back home at the cost of some money and some of your items.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalHangout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalHangout">Local Hangout</a>: The Stardrop Saloon, run by Gus. On Friday night you'll find about two-thirds of the entire valley's inhabitants gathered there. It's one of the best ways to boost your affection with so many characters at once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">The Lost Woods</a>: The Secret Woods, an area to the west of the player's farm. It's the only viable place to gather hardwood if you don't have a Forest Farm, and it also has slimes to fight, rare foraging items, and a mysterious statue searching for the "perfect sweetness".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat">Luck Stat</a>: This stat is randomly generated at the beginning of each day, viewable from the fortune telling channel. It affects certain aspects of the game, like the drop rate of mine ladders. This can also be temporarily modified by certain items like cooked meals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyRabbitsFoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyRabbitsFoot">Lucky Rabbit's Foot</a>: A sufficiently befriended rabbit will occasionally drop a Rabbit's Foot instead of wool and the item description says that some consider it lucky. While carrying it does not affect the player's luck, it can be traded for a charm that <em>does</em> increase your luck. It also has one other beneficial use: if you've made all the bachelors/bachelorettes fall in love with you without marrying them, the Rabbit's Foot averts the cutscene where they all dump you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke, I Am Your Father</a>: One of the fisherman stories in the library ends with the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gordy was Tex's father all along.</span><div class="indent"> <em>*Dramatic Music as the curtains fall*</em></div></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageTower">Mage Tower</a>: The Wizard lives in a tower in the western part of Cindersap Forest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">Mana Meter</a>: The more general Energy, instead of Mana. It decreases with tool use, consumption of energy-lowering foods, and a few other things. Energy is restored mainly through eating food and using the Spa. In multiplayer, a character can also regain energy by laying in their bed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>: Joja Corporation, of course. From what we see in the intro, it's a large, soulless company that cares little for its employees. In the game proper, they've temporarily blocked off the mines after some reckless drilling caused an avalanche, produce two types of soda (one that's merely not very healthy and one that may or may not damage your stomach lining and <em>turn your skin blue</em>), have polluted the waters with old Joja Net CDs, and intend to drive the local competition out of business.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier">Money Multiplier</a>:<ul><li> The quality of a good will increase its value. While mostly random, there are ways to increase the chance of getting a good quality item, like using fertilizer (crops) or casting the line further away from any landmass (fish).</li><li> The processed version of something sells for more then the basic version (mayo sells for more than eggs, cheese sells for more than milk, etc), encouraging you to craft processing machines for your farm.</li><li> Casks increase the quality and thus price of cheese and alcohol over time. Otherwise, there is no way to produce alcohol with any star or cheese above a gold quality.</li><li> Skills act as multipliers in two manners. First, higher levels of Farming, Foraging, and Fishing increase the chance of getting quality crops, foraged items, and fish respectively. Using food items to increase the level adds to this. Second, several of the Profession choices at Level 5 and 10 of skills offer a flat increase to the sale value of items.</li><li> Bear's Knowledge triples the sell value of Blackberries and Salmonberries, making the raw fruit worth as much as the wine. Similarly, Spring Onion Mastery increases the sell value of the item five-fold.</li><li> Planting flowers next to bee houses causes the honey produced to have a higher sale value based on the type of flower. The value of the honey can increase enough that it's worth more raw than processed into mead.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink">Money Sink</a>:<ul><li> Four Obelisks can be purchased from the Wizard's Tower. The Earth and Water Obelisks each cost 500 thousand gold (prior to 1.5, they went for one million) while the Desert and Island Obelisks each coast one million gold. They can be used to transport you instantly to the forest, the beach, the Calico Desert, or the Fern Island an infinite number of times.</li><li> The Gold Clock costs ten million gold, also found in the Wizard's Tower. Placing it on your farm prevents debris from showing up.</li><li> Krobus sells a Return Scepter for two million gold. The Scepter is essentially an infinite-use Warp Totem that transports you to the front door of your farmhouse when used.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>: At the end of year 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your grandfather evaluates your work on your farm, and it can be surprisingly dark and harsh depending on how much or how little work you've done</span>. In an interview with PC Gamer, the developer admitted outright that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the harshness of the evaluation</span> clashed too much with the game's overall relaxed, casual tone, and he changed it with the patch 1.05 update.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MooksButNoBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MooksButNoBosses">Mooks but No Bosses</a>: There are no boss enemies in the dungeons. The closest you get to them are the floors where the exit appears when all enemies are defeated, including one type of floor in the Skull Cavern where Pepper Rexes make their only appearances, but they're encountered in squads and go down just as quickly as other enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreFriendsMoreBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreFriendsMoreBenefits">More Friends, More Benefits</a>: Increasing relationships with the locals will result in them sending you gifts and recipes in the mail. Several of these recipes can't be obtained any other way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLocal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLocal">My Local</a>: The Stardrop Saloon, which includes an arcade "for the youth to hang out".

Cranberries in particular were pounded with the nerf bat until only a reddish-purple goop remained, becoming less than half as profitable as they were pre-patch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">Next Tier Power-Up</a>: Consuming a Stardrop permanently increases the size of the farmer's energy bar.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceDayDeadlyNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceDayDeadlyNight">Nice Day, Deadly Night</a>: If players pick the wilderness farm, monsters will spawn at night.

The exception to the max friendship rule is a player's spouse. If a player doesn't talk to their spouse, their friendship goes down by twenty points a day, and it never stops decreasing as long as the player continues to ignore them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonCombatEXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonCombatEXP">Non-Combat EXP</a>: Combat is one of the five categories with experience-based skill levels. The others are Farming, Mining, Fishing, and Foraging.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">Not Allowed to Grow Up</a>: You can play the game for as many in-game years as you desire, but no one will ever get any older. This is most noticeable with the two kids Vincent and Jas, as well as any children that the player has with their spouse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCScheduling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCScheduling">NPC Scheduling</a>: Characters go about their business irrespective of what the player character does. While it does make the town feel more alive, it can be annoying when you need to buy something and that NPC shopkeeper is spending the day at the doctor or taking an exercise class.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a>: Your pet goes into the house at night to sleep, but is never actually seen walking into it. Which means you can see it sleep out on your farm, then ten seconds later walk into your house and see them curled up on your bed like they've been there the whole time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>: Everyone in the game, with three exceptions: M. Rasmodius, although everyone (including the game itself) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">just calls him "Wizard" anyway</a>; George (Penny calls him Mr. Mullner); and Evelyn (a note in Penny's handwriting calls her Granny Mullner). Most of these names are first names, with one exception: the mysterious <em>Mr.</em> Qi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a>: Levels 41-80 and 81-120 of the mine are the same layout as levels 1-40, just swapped with an ice and a fire aesthetic, respectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>: Functional nuclear families are a surprising rarity in Pelican Town. Among the characters who still live at home with their families, the following have one or more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">absent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">parents</a>:<ul><li> Sebastian's biological father is no longer a part of his life, and his fate is never mentioned by any character, not even Sebastian himself (who's too busy dwelling on how much his step-father Demetrius doesn't seem to like him).</li><li> Alex is an orphan; his abusive father abandoned him and his mother, and then his mother died. He lives with his maternal grandparents.</li><li> Penny's father left her and Pam to fend for themselves when she was a girl. Pam, meanwhile, is a drunk who doesn't seem to notice how much her drinking affects Penny's life.</li><li> Haley and Emily's parents are world travelers, leaving their two daughters to look after the house in their absence. They never appear in the game, not even at their daughter's wedding should the player marry either of them.</li><li> Sam and Vincent at first play this straight, because their father Kent is away serving in the military. However, he returns at the beginning of the second year, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">he's clearly not the same man he was when he left</a>.</li><li> Jas' parents were friends of Shane's, but they both died tragically, leading him to take her in; she lives with him and her "Aunt" Marnie.</li><li> Maru and Abigail are the only characters to avert this, as they live with their two parents from the outset of the game, unless and until you marry them. However, Abigail often clashes with her parents, especially Pierre. This would make Maru the only character who lives with both of her biological parents in a stable, happy relationship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also, it is often hinted that Pierre is <em>not</em> Abigail's biological father, and is possibly the product of Caroline's dalliance with the Wizard.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>:<ul><li> Before the 1.1 update, several key items could only be found once and were unrecoverable.<ul><li> The Mermaid's Pendant could be bought only once, and if it was destroyed somehow before the player used it, the player would be locked out of marriage.</li><li> The Galaxy Sword could only be created once, and losing it meant the player lost the at-the-time best weapon in the game.</li></ul></li><li> Sam's three-heart event can only be triggered during the first year, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his father Kent comes home in the second</span>.</li><li> Rarecrows can be blown up from bombs, without any means of replacing them. All the more reason to keep bombs off the farming grounds! They can also be lost "naturally" by debris on the farm expanding randomly each day and destroying them. All it takes sometimes is for you not to pay attention to the wild growth on some remote corner of your farm for a few days. Fortunately, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeature">Anti-Frustration Feature</a> was added to the game that allows purchasing additional copies of previously once-per-game rarecrows after one has been acquired.</li><li> Clint's six-heart event will be lost if the player did Emily's eight-heart event first, or if Emily marries the player. This is because the event revolves around Clint's crush on Emily.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpFood">Power-Up Food</a>: Many food items not only restore energy and health, but also bestow temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buffs</a> like increased levels in Farming, Foraging, etc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness">Predatory Business</a>: Joja Corporation's JojaMart retail chain is obviously a pastiche of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walmart">Walmart</a>, and they even have a flagship product called "Joja Cola". Their business moved into Pelican Town in the hopes of driving Pierre's shop out of business and turning the Community Center into a warehouse. Hell, before the PC quits their job there, <em>the skeleton of a former employee nobody's bothered to do anything about</em> can be seen a couple cubicles in front of theirs. One almost has to wonder if Morris meant it literally when he said "I'm done for" after the community center was fixed up and he realized he lost the battle for the town.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionThrowback">Production Throwback</a>: Joja Cola originates from <a class="urllink" href="http://wumbusworld.com/index.php?strip=33">a panel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of Eric Barone's previous webcomic, <em>Wumbus World</em>. Said panel shows a newspaper ad promoting the soda as having "3x more aspartame" than before, which would make it ridiculously sweet, possibly explaining why the villagers all hate it so much. <em>Wumbus World</em> is referenced again at the movie theater, introduced in version 1.4, which will sometimes screen a movie called <em>Wumbus</em> that evidently stars the comic's title character.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsPowerful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsPowerful">Purple Is Powerful</a>:<ul><li> The most powerful tier of items are purple.

Eating a Purple Mushroom of Iridium (purple) quality gave more energy than <em>any prepared meal</em>, and was in fact one of the most nutritious objects in the game. 1.5 adds a new mushroom that is more powerful and valuable than that: the Magma Cap, a magenta-colored mushroom found in the volcanic cavern on Ginger Island. A basic quality Magma Cap restores as much health and energy as a silver quality Purple Mushroom.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">Ragnar&ouml;k Proofing</a>: Dwarven artifacts appear to be computers, still powered and active (but impossible to use for anything).

Some occur on dates randomly determined when a save file is first generated while others occur if certain conditions are met.<ul><li> A crop fairy can visit the farm at night and cause all planted crops within a set area to instantly reach maturity.</li><li> A meteor can crash into the farm, destroying anything it lands on and requiring a gold pickaxe to harvest.</li><li> A UFO can visit the farm, leaving a capsule behind. This requires a set of randomly selected squares in the farm be empty or the visit does not occur.</li><li> An owl statue can appear on the farm. This has the same requirement as the UFO visit.</li><li> When the player has a coop or slime hutch the Witch has a chance of cursing it at night. This causes a Void Egg to appear in the coop or turns all slimes in the hutch black.</li><li> During fall, a Mushroom Tree may appear on the farm.</li><li> If you have any farm animals out overnight and you don't have the doors to their homes open, there is a chance that one of them will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen">killed overnight by wild animals</a>.</li><li> A train may pass by during the daytime.

This is in contrast to the static overworld map, including the farm. However, ConcernedApe moved away from pure procedural generation for the caves/mines, instead designing "some things" by hand.</li><li> This is even more so the case in the Skull Cavern. In the regular mines, where there is still a sense of randomness in the enemies and items that spawn, as well as when the ladders show up, those mines have a set <em>layout</em> for each level and it ends at level 120. In the Skull Cavern, however, the level layouts are <em>completely</em> randomized and you can go down well past level 120.</li><li> The volcanic cave in Ginger Island has a randomized layout for most of the dungeon. The only floors that remain the same are the entrance level, floor 5 (which holds a shop), and floor 10 (which houses a forge that lets you combine rings or enhance your gear).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">Rare Candy</a>: The Stardrop fruits permanently increase your maximum energy.

You can smooth over a serious misunderstanding with his wife, and you can befriend him, but he still wanders the town lost and out of place, and his relationship with his kids doesn't see much improvement.</li><li> You can't fix Sebastian's estrangement from Maru and Demetrius (although his relationship with Robin will improve if he marries and moves out). He'll also struggle to kick his smoking habit, although he seems to be at least partially successful in this respect.</li><li> The player only gets into the farming business because they inherited it - like how most farms generally get passed along family lines.</li><li> A lot of people in Pelican Town are unemployed or self-employed. Much like how in a real life small town, not a lot of people in a town means there aren't enough jobs to go around.</li><li> Linus claims he goes through garbage because he doesn't want food to go to waste, but Gus is more realistic about the situation, clarifying that he does it because he can't afford food.</li><li> If you complete every bundle in the Community Center, the JojaMart will shut down, and Morris and his plans for the town are both done for, causing JojaMart to leave Pelican Town. Great, right? Not entirely, since it means that the townspeople who worked there are now out of a job. Shane is particularly unhappy about the situation, since it was the only job he could get. With JojaMart gone, Shane now can't support his family at all, making his depression even worse.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a>: As of 1.3, if you get ten hearts of friendship with every bachelor or bachelorette in the game but have yet to marry, the town will take note of this and perceive the player as this. And the next time you visit Emily and Haley's house or Gus' restaurant, all of the bachelor/ettes will confront you. Normally this ends very poorly for the player, and everyone will be angry with them for at least a week. However, if they have the Lucky Rabbit's Foot in their inventory at the time of being caught, instead of a hostile confrontation, the respective group greets the player with open arms, either gossiping or playing pool without a hint of resent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefiningResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefiningResources">Refining Resources</a>: Certain raw items can be refined into other items, in particular, ore to ingots.

Everyone who can't be romanced can reach ten hearts by default. The player's spouse has their maximum affection rating increased to twelve hearts. The only regularly-recurring NPCs who can't be made friends with are Morris (because he's the villain of the story) and the two men who work in the Adventurer's Guild.</li><li> There also exist less nuanced relationship systems with the animals the player can adopt and raise; both livestock and pets (with five and four hearts to fill, respectively). The former determines how high-quality the goods they produce (such as eggs and milk) are, while the latter has no in-game benefit <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> except for potentially boosting Grandpa's evaluation score if you care for your pet enough</span> but is a great source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient">Repressive, but Efficient</a>: Say what you like about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatoryBusiness">their methods</a>, there's no denying that Joja gets things done.

Add to this the fact that you can only give them a gift two times per game week and if you get it wrong you can even lose hearts with them, figuring out gifts without using a guide can get quite frustrating. Even the few "universal" loves tend to have exceptions (e.g. everyone loves Prismatic Shards except Haley, who hates them).

This is especially true of the bachelors and bachelorettes: many seem to be fresh out of high school or the equivalent (Alex, Haley, Maru, and Penny in particular) whereas others are clearly meant to be somewhat older (Elliott, Leah, and Harvey in particular). ConcernedApe has said that all the characters are "legal" and that he envisions most of the younger bachelor(ette)s to be around 20 years old.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>: As you befriend characters, you help make positive changes in their lives. Many players also opt to "rescue" the characters they feel the most sympathy for via marriage, such as marrying Penny to save her from her unhealthy relationship with her mother. Alternately, a great number of people romance and marry Sebastian, who barely HAS a relationship with his whole family as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>:<ul><li> You can do some pretty horrible things to the characters that play on their worst fears and insecurities, such as calling Alex "worthless" (shortly after he's revealed to you that his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">abusive father</span> hurled that specific insult at him on a regular basis).</li><li> The 1.1 update adds a few more callous ways to interact with other characters. You are free to divorce and marry all the eligible villagers if you so choose to. And while they will hold a grudge against you after you divorce them, you can activate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a dark shrine in the Witch's hut</span> to erase their memories, causing them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">forget</a> that you were ever involved with them and letting you start fresh. And by offering a Prismatic Shard to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> another dark shrine</span> you can turn your children into doves, permanently removing them from your life.</li><li> On top of all of the above, you can even romance Emily in the update, <em>after pushing Clint</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to ask her out!</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">You can also anger people by using the slingshot on them, or building things in their walking paths</a>.</li><li> If you don't give back Lewis's Lucky Shorts immediately, you can use it in the Luau pot, grossing out the Governor and royally pissing off Lewis. You can also use it for your display at the Stardew Valley Fair, causing Lewis to bribe you with 750 stars to get you to keep quiet about it.</li><li> With the addition of the movie theater, you can take one of the kids to a horror movie. Surprise, they dislike it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>: There are several things you can do which cause people to lose friendship points with the farmer.<ul><li> Shooting people with a slingshot causes a drop in friendship, since they'll be annoyed with you.</li><li> Using an item with a negative energy value (such as a Red Mushroom or Void Mayonnaise) in the potluck soup at the Luau will cause a substantial hit in your friendship values with everyone in town.</li><li> Rejecting Penny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a> in her ten-heart event causes her to lose 1,500 points of affection for the player (a full six hearts) and prevents the player from romancing her.

However, the player can no longer earn the smaller rewards from completing bundles, and the "Friendship" bonus that would have increased everyone's friendship with the player by 500 points will no longer be available.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRandomizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRandomizer">Video Game Randomizer</a>: Patch 1.5 added Advanced Game Options to, among other things, randomize the requests in the Community Center bundles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTime">Video Game Time</a>: The compressed time ratio means that getting from your house to the mountains can take an hour, which seems reasonable if you were to interpret the overworld map as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverworldNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverworldNotToScale">not to scale</a>. But then there's the matter of taking 10 in-game minutes just to get from your bed in an upgraded house to the front door and characters taking <em>hours</em> to use a microwave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler">Walking Spoiler</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Krobus and the Dwarf</span> might count.

In fact, it can take several in game years to complete the main storyline, so that player is all but encouraged to take things at their own pace. The only thing that has a "time limit", so to speak, is the evaluation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your Grandpa</span> gives you at the end of Year 2, but as of patch 1.05, you can get re-evaluated at any time afterwards at the cost of a diamond.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">Wins by Doing Absolutely Nothing</a>: Due to the way the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame">Fishing Minigame</a> works, it's occasionally possible to reel in a fish (and even get a perfect catch) by not doing anything at all after you've cast the line.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsJustAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsJustAwesome">The World Is Just Awesome</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Which is why</a> we need to preserve it from the ruthless forces of capitalism so we can all enjoy it with the people close to us.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">You Mean "Xmas"</a>: The Egg Festival, Spirit's Eve, and the Feast of the Winter Star are analogous to Easter, Halloween, and Thanksgiving/Christmas respectively.</li></ul></div><hr>
