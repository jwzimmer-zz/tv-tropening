In addition to introducing a new story and region to explore and over 100 new Pok&eacute;mon to catch, <em>Ruby</em> and <em>Sapphire</em> brought with it many new gameplay features such as individual natures and Abilities for each Pok&eacute;mon, double battles, and Pok&eacute;mon contests. Along with massive graphical improvements over its predecessors, these games also had an entirely new data structure; as a result, Generation III games were incompatible with the previous two generations.</p><p>The games took place in Hoenn, which is based on the Kyushu region of Japan rotated ninety degrees<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08hqc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note08hqc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08hqc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, since the world is round and we never see Hoenn on a map along with any other regions, this rotation doesn't matter much</span>. The game begins with the player moving to their new home in Littleroot Town, and later saving the local Pok&eacute;mon Professor, Birch, from a wild Pok&eacute;mon. As thanks, he gives the player their own Pok&eacute;mon, encouraging him/her to travel around the region and collect as much data on Hoenn's Pok&eacute;mon as they can, much like Birch's child (and your rival) Brendan/May is doing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1up9r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1up9r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1up9r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Your rival is whichever player character you didn't pick at the beginning; if playing as May, Brendan is your rival, and vice versa.</span></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>On their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">quest to be the best</a>, players will encounter two villainous groups: Teams Aqua and Magma, who want to flood and dry out the planet, respectively. <em>Sapphire</em> players will become allied with Team Magma to stop Aqua summoning Kyogre, while <em>Ruby</em> Trainers help Aqua stop Magma summoning Groudon. <em>Emerald</em> put them both in the antagonist role, with Rayquaza being summoned to stop the chaos.</p><p>These games may be the biggest case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo">One Game for the Price of Two</a> in the franchise, as there is literally no way to legitimately collect all 386 Pok&eacute;mon without aid from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">FireRed</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">LeafGreen</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Colosseum</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">XD</a></em> (and oddly, only <em>Ruby</em> <em><strong>or</strong></em> <em>Sapphire</em>, because <em>Emerald</em> has whatever Pok&eacute;mon the other version lacks).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wv5c');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2wv5c" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wv5c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> had backwards-compatibility for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a>, but its link cables were unable to connect the two systems; coupled with the aforementioned data structure redesign, there was no method for importing or trading Pok&eacute;mon from <em>Gold</em>, <em>Silver</em> or <em>Crystal</em> to <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Sapphire</em> or <em>Emerald</em>.</span> The <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameRemake">remakes</a> provided all 150 Kanto Pok&eacute;mon and a small pool of Johto's, with <em>Colosseum</em> and <em>XD</em> having several from all three regions; together, they had all but the event-only Pok&eacute;mon.

Starting from Gen III, an NPC (in Fallarbor Town for this generation) will do this for a Heart Scale. These can easily be farmed off of Luvdisc, can be found with the Item Finder scattered across the overworld, and occasionally can be given a reward from NPCs for doing certain tasks.</li><li> The Soothe Bell was introduced to double up the happiness gain rate of its holder, speeding up the time needed to grind for happiness based-evolutions. This is very helpful since most Pok&eacute;mon evolving through this method are too weak to grind happiness by leveling up, massages are limited to once per day and vitamins are expensive.</li><li> In <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">the Sky Pillar</a> has sections with cracked floor tiles that force you to use the Mach Bike to traverse over them without falling through.

Rather than just one list that it could pull from, Pickup's rewards were scaled to level. Thus, it would generally only give low-level items early in the game. However, by the levels where you'd be expect to beat the Elite Four, it was giving out items on par with the <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em> version. And for the post-game, if you leveled up to above level 90, it gave out even better rewards than the original version.

Marshtomp also only has one weakness (Grass) that isn't too common and has decent bulk, meaning you don't have to worry about it taking a lot of damage.</li><li> The Pickup ability has a 10% chance of acquiring an item after each battle. The drop table isn't level-scaled in any way in <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em>, meaning you can find valuable items like Nuggets, Rare Candy, PP Ups, etc. as soon as you find a Mon with the ability.

A perfect example of an effective glass cannon. While frail, it is blindingly fast, evolves at Level 22, learns great spam moves, and has the ability Guts, which boosts its Attack by 1.5&times; when statused. However, it is the only Pok&eacute;mon in the Hoenn Dex to also get same-type attack bonus on Facade, giving it a ridiculous 346 power after modifiers if Swellow is statused and holding a Silk Scarf. This is all coming off a decent 85 Attack stat. Give it a burn via a wild Slugma's Flame Body, stock up on Potions, and tear things to shreds. You don't even have to worry about PP, as a standard moveset of Facade, Wing Attack, Steel Wing and Fly has a total of 95 PP.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>:<ul><li> This is the generation in which Nintendo events blossomed into its full form.

Linking with <em>FireRed</em>, <em>LeafGreen</em>, <em>Emerald</em>, <em>Colosseum</em>, <em>XD</em>, an event for a Shiny Zigzagoon at EB Games, a pair of Japanese promo e-Reader cards, non-Japanese releases of <em>Pok&eacute;mon Box</em>, or the PAL release of <em>Pok&eacute;mon Channel</em> patched the error. Due to the bug's nature, even if you couldn't access any of the myriad fixes, it would cease affecting your game at most one year after it started.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64wv0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note64wv0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64wv0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically, each daily event or berry tree that got caught up in the glitch would start working properly again one year after it was last accessed <em>before</em> the glitch kicked in.

Fortunately, unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Gold, Silver, and Crystal</a></em>, the battery isn't used to retain save data as well (which holis stored using flash memory; <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> don't have batteries at all), so the game can still be played, just without the time-based events. Replacing the battery restarts the flow of day, allowing Eevee's evolutions to vary and Shoal Cave's tide to change, but completely destroys the clock-based events of the game unless you start a new file or use external devices. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note70wln');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note70wln" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note70wln');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Replacing the battery resets the cart's real-time clock back to its earliest value of January 1, 2000. Since the game partially allocates when time-based events are due to happen to an actual date based on when the game was started and how much time has passed since then, the game is thrown off as to when they should happen, for example a Razz Berry that has been planted for four hours in a game affected by a replaced battery won't be at the fruit-bearing stage, let alone sprout because the game hasn't reached the date that those events are to occur.</span></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pomeg_glitch">Pomeg Berry Glitch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <em>Emerald</em> allows you to reduce a Pok&eacute;mon's HP to negative digits. While most side effects are normally harmless, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/om_gbtMAw6I?t=1m16s">you can potentially lock a battle into an infinite loop if the Pok&eacute;mon with negative HP is hit with a HP draining attack<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiverOfLameNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiverOfLameNames">Giver of Lame Names</a>: A pair of NPC's reference this trope, warning the player to be careful when choosing their Pok&eacute;mon's names. Of note, the old man named his Pikachu "Pekachu". Worse in the remakes, as the said old man's Pok&eacute;mon is now a Shroomish with the same name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>:<ul><li> While the Pok&eacute;dex tells you that Feebas can be found on Route 119, it does not tell you that they will only spawn in six randomly-chosen water tiles (out of the 436 in the route) that are re-rolled under certain conditions. Making matters worse is that you're not even guaranteed to find Feebas when fishing on those tiles.</li><li> The Pok&eacute;mon Chimecho is not used by any trainers, which will leave you with an empty slot in the Pok&eacute;dex that you won't be able to fill easily (the Pok&eacute;dex tells you where you can catch Pok&eacute;mon you've seen). It only appears in one area &mdash; the top section of Mt. Pyre &mdash; and is extremely rare on top of that with a 1% encounter rate, making it extremely easy to miss.</li><li> In Contests, using certain move combinations (i.e. Sunny Day on turn 1 and then Solar Beam on turn 2) will net you bonus appeal points. The only hint towards this is that the second move is highlighted the turn after you've used the first one. Since Pok&eacute;mon can only know four moves at a time, finding these combinations through gameplay is a tedious process, assuming you ever figure out that they exist to begin with.</li><li> Finding the Regis. First off, you have to go to Pacifildog Town and solve a puzzle involving water currents. Once you find a water spot to Dive in, you'll follow a path to a cave. Once you're in the cave, you'll find walls written in braille. Once you decipher the message of the walls, you'll need to get a Wailord, a Relicanth and a Pok&eacute;mon that can use Dig (which if you accidentally lose, it makes getting them much harder), put them in your party in a specific order (Wailord in the front, Relicanth in the back) and go back to cave. The game will then shake and then you have to go to plains where specific rock formations are around Hoenn to find a cave that is now accessible. <em>Then</em> you have to solve individual and cryptic puzzles in each of those cave formations to open the room where the Regis reside so you can challenge them. <em>You got all that?</em> The <em>only</em> way this could be "easier" is if you knew the game manual had a braille section allowing the player to understand what the walls said. If not, good luck finding these guys without spending <em>hours</em> of trial and error.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">Hello, [Insert Name Here]</a>: Standard for the player character.

Either the sun turns baking hot, the rain falls uncontrollably, or you get <em>both</em> ridiculous weather conditions alternating rapidly back and forth.

Pok&eacute;mon in Day Care gain one experience point per every step the player takes. While its nice to have a Pok&eacute;mon leveling-up while you simply walk around, there are several drawbacks to this method. For one, Pok&eacute;mon in Day Care will not evolve. Two, if a Pok&eacute;mon reaches a level where it can learn a new move, it will always learn that move; if the Pok&eacute;mon already knows four moves, its first move will be forgotten and the new move will be placed last. This can lead to your Mons forgetting moves you wanted while learning moves you do not. Third, the Mon will not gain Effort Points as it would have if you leveled it up yourself through battle.

Strangely, his kid brother didn't get one.<ul><li> Inverted by Tate and Liza who go from been about the same age as the player to becoming young children.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>:<ul><li> Wally's battle theme is not just a battle theme. It's also a theme meant to symbolize the rivalry between you and him (as evident by the fact that it's officially called "Rival's Theme" within the soundtrack).</li><li> According to the soundtrack, the song that plays during the epilogue to the Delta Episode is meant to be the theme song of the remakes themselves and is named "Strains of a New Beginning" within the English translations of the game.</li><li> The soundtrack reveals that Rayquaza's battle theme is meant to be the true version of the equivalent song from the original games, as they both share the name "Battle! (Super-Ancient Pok&eacute;mon)". While the song for Groudon and Kyogre is extremely similar, it's meant for their Primal Reversions and called "Battle! (Primal Reversion)".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>: The Delta Episode implies that the remakes are alternate universes to the original <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em> games, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">the nails</a> being the fact that the evolution of Pok&eacute;mon took a slightly different path, the existence of the war in Kalos, and the discovery of Mega Evolution. It's also implied that the different versions of each game could be alternate universes to each other (a fact that had already been explored somewhat in <em>Black and White</em>); when you first enter the Battle Resort in <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>, Maxie muses that perhaps, in another reality, he was the one you fought, and summoned Groudon. Archie does the same in <em>Omega Ruby</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorBattlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorBattlefield">Amazing Technicolor Battlefield</a>:<ul><li> While fighting Maxie or Archie in Seafloor Cavern, the background is a sea of fire and lava with bypassing flying fire rocks, or a water whirlpool, respectively.</li><li> You literally fight Deoxys within the stratosphere.</li><li> You fight the non-Hoenn legendaries except Regigigas (as well as the Latias/Latios you get with the Eon Ticket in spite of being native to Hoenn) in an arena resembling pinkish dreamy clouds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>: The Cosplay Pikachu is given to you once you enter your first Contest, at which point you can bring it to the dressing room in any Contest Hall to change its costume. Thankfully it's not just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">Cosmetic Award</a>, as each outfit gives her a new move normal Pikachu can't learn otherwise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: A lot of gameplay elements are tweaked to be more forgiving.<ul><li> Many of the features from <em>X and Y</em> return, such as Super Training and the changes to breeding mechanics.</li><li> Rare Pok&eacute;mon that you haven't caught yet appear more frequently in the overworld than normal encounters.</li><li> Every O-Power except for the Hatching Power is obtained in Mauville's Pok&eacute;mon Center, though each one requires progressing through the story first.</li><li> Granite Cave has been redesigned so that Steven is right at the entrance, making the rest of the cave optional. In addition, the darkness in the lower floors is negligible, and can easily be navigated without Flash.</li><li> It's now possible to own both the Mach Bike and Acro Bike at the same time, although you're only allowed to do so after beating the game. Still, it beats having to constantly run back and switch bikes to get through different areas.</li><li> The kinds of Pok&eacute;mon you can get are specifically arranged so that, with some trading between the various Generation VI games, you can complete the National Pok&eacute;dex without having to import any Pok&eacute;mon from previous generations despite this being possible through Pok&eacute;Transport. Granted, you still need to do the latter in order to obtain Mythical Pok&eacute;mon, though they still won't count towards your completion rate (save for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deoxys</span>).</li><li> Pok&eacute;blocks are considerably simplified and easier to understand. The idea of them having feel is gone and they can only have two levels, you're not dependent on what berries NPCs throw in to get the color you want, and there's no need to play a minigame. Just open up the Pok&eacute;block Kit, pop in four berries of your choice (with the game now pointing out which ones increase which contest stats), and out pop four Pok&eacute;blocks of the predominant color in the blend (or a rainbow block if four different ones are used). Further, there's no limit to how many Pok&eacute;blocks a Pok&eacute;mon can eat now and their preference isn't affect by Natures, so feel free to stuff them full of basic-level blocks as much as you want if you can't get your hands on plus ones. This also makes it much easier to evolve Feebas.</li><li> Several points in the game that required backtracking in the originals now give you an option to just travel there immediately. For example, after beating Flannery your rival will offer to travel with you to Petalburg City so you can fight Norman.</li><li> The cracked floor tiles found in Granite Cave and Sky Pillar that required the Mach Bike have been completely removed, making traversing them much easier.</li><li> Getting Feebas is no longer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, as it can be found anywhere on Route 119's river with any of the fishing rods. Alternatively, just fish in the shadow under a certain bridge during the day, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoljKZCGfu4">and you will find Feebas all the time<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. If it's night, you can fish it by a rock in the southern part of the route instead.</li><li> The Safari Zone is now free, doesn't have a step limit, and allows you to catch Pok&eacute;mon the old-fashioned way, meaning no more fleeing Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> If you couldn't catch Kyogre or Groudon, they will respawn in the Cave of Origin after beating the Elite Four. Deoxys will spawn at the top of Sky Pillar if you couldn't catch it during Delta Episode.</li><li> The ice tile puzzles in Wallace's gym stay solved if you fall through the floor on the next one and need to climb back up; in the original games, a fall meant starting over.</li><li> Surfing the ocean routes is made more manageable: encounter rates are lower, there are Ace Trainers so you're not just fighting Water Pok&eacute;mon, the Pok&eacute;Nav map on the bottom screen makes it significantly easier to figure out where you're going, and movement speed is faster (and can be increased further by Surfing on a Sharpedo).</li><li> You can use Fly to travel to <em>any</em> location now, not just towns. You still need to walk to the specific part of that location you want to get to, but it's a huge cut to travel time. After fighting the title Legendary in the Cave of Origin, you get the Eon Flute so you can use Latias/Latios to Soar without even needing them in your party. Without even needing them in your <em>game</em>, in fact.</li><li> Since catching Rayquaza is now mandatory to complete the game, its catch rate has been increased significantly.</li><li> If you raised the affection levels of a Pok&eacute;mon in Pok&eacute;mon-amie, then traded it from <em>X and Y</em> to <em>Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</em> or vice-versa, the Pok&eacute;mon will still have the same affection for its original trainer if it is traded back.</li><li> None of the TMs require Battle Points to purchase, thus making it possible to collect them all without Battle Resort grinding.</li><li> Berry farming is much more convenient than in <em>X and Y</em>. Berry yields are much larger on average and there is no more need to weed and get rid of pests. There are also more berry plots (including a large garden with 24 plots) and with the ability to fly to routes it is easy to maintain many plants. The Pok&eacute;Nav Plus also has an app that keeps track of all the berries you planted and lets you know if any of them are ready to harvest without having to go there.</li><li> In addition, a few more NPCs that give berries were added compared to the original games. Some secret base trainers also provide berries when using their special skill. Also, audience members in the contests halls reward you items, including berries, when you win a Pok&eacute;mon contest. This makes obtaining particularly rare berries a lot easier.</li><li> Rainy weather no longer prevents Sweet Scent from triggering Hordes like in <em>X and Y</em>, since it is almost always raining on Route 119.</li><li> Many players find the "Withdraw" and "Deposit" Pok&eacute;mon options in the PC to be inferior to the "Organize" option below them, which does both along with other features. After meeting Lanette, players can ask her to put the "Organize" option at the top of the list to make it the default option.</li><li> The Battle Resort is effectively optimized for breeding. In addition to a Day Care that takes two Pok&eacute;mon, the island contains a unique camera setup that adjusts itself so that the shore runs along the bottom of the screen whenever you turn a corner. Positioned properly, you can achieve an "infinite loop" that enables you to bike circles around the island by just holding the Up button<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03x66');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note03x66" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03x66');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As an added bonus, the loop is exactly 255 tiles long, the same number of steps needed to complete a single Egg Cycle</span>. One could just weigh down the Up button with a heavy object and effectively let the game automate itself. The game's local Stat Judge is also located in the Pok&eacute;mon Center just adjacent to the Day Care, allowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">min-maxers</a> to quickly check the IVs of their newly-hatched Pok&eacute;mon without having to travel between locales, unlike in <em>X and Y</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">Anti Poop-Socking</a>:<ul><li> The games prevent battling the trainers in other players' Secret Bases added via QR Code until the day after they have been added.</li><li> You can only obtain the Secret Bases, Mirage Spots and news of other players on the internet every eight hours.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>: Like in the original, only a few select places avert this; Sootopolis, Lilycove, and this time around Mossdeep. Played straight everywhere else, which is ironic considering the BuzzNav reports everything within seconds and thus everyone in the entire country should be panicking. It gets somewhat ludicrous in <em>Omega Ruby</em>; the sky is literally burning thanks to Groudon yet the trainers you encounter on the routes will still want to battle you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>: Aside from the potential disaster from awakening Groudon and Kyogre in the main game, the Delta Episode introduces a six mile long asteroid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">that threatens to strike the planet</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Log</a>: The various documents left in Sea Mauville.

To unlock them, you need to talk to a Hex Maniac in the northern part of Route 111's desert using the Mach Bike, a Bird Keeper near the Weather Institute at Route 119 using the Acro Bike and the moves Surf and Waterfall, and a Biker in the post-game only Battle Resort.</li><li> The Contest move combinations are again left unknown, but to make matters worse some have been changed.</li><li> The Mirage Spots that contain Legendaries require having at least one Pok&eacute;mon in your party with a specific attribute or relation to the Legendary you find at the spot, with each one having different requirements. The games give no hints as to what they are or even imply that any sort of trigger is required to access them, though at least some of them make a bit of sense (i.e. to encounter Kyurem you need to have Reshiram and Zekrom). Compounding this is that 3 of the Mirage Spots cycle through which Legendary you can encounter based off the time of day (or day of the week for Terrakion, Cobalion, and Virizion), which again isn't made privy to you so you might go off somewhere else thinking the spot is now empty.</li><li> To encounter Regigigas, you have to capture all three Regis and go to the Island Cave (the location of Regice) with them in your party during the daytime while a nicknamed Regice holds a ice-related item. The only clues you get for these steps are very vague lines of dialogue from a girl in Pacifidlog, and even then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">she's not guaranteed to give them when talked to</a> .</li><li> Finding either Lugia or Ho-Oh in Sea Mauville requires you to nab a hidden item from the underwater part and then take it to the bottom or top of the rig. There's a guy who gives you a vague idea of the item you need to find, but that's it.</li><li> There's a locked room in the Sea Mauville that tells you you're being watched when you enter, and reading through some files mentions the Odd Keystone (an item related to Spiritomb). You can encounter a Spiritomb by opening and closing your bag after reading the document about the Old Keystone, but the game never gives a hint about taking that course of action.</li><li> The fact that you can chain Pok&eacute;mon on the DexNav to increase the chance of obtaining Pok&eacute;mon with ideal stats. The only hint to this is the fact that if you defeat or capture a DexNav Pok&eacute;mon, searching for them again will almost always result in another DexNav Pok&eacute;mon spawning.</li><li> It's possible to beat Lisia, Wallace and Fairy Tale Girl Julia within the Contest Spectacular's preliminary rounds. This requires maxing out both the primary condition for that contest, plus the contest's two "secondary" (ie neighboring) catagories (for example, to get the best performance in a Coolness Contest, you have to also max out Beauty and Toughness). Your only indication of this is that maxing out one category doesn't quite flesh out its slice of the star representing that Pok&eacute;mon's condition in all five catagories.. Because of this, you're best off only ever making and feeding them Rainbow Pok&eacute;blocks, since even for only one catagory it's more efficient for max performance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime">Heroic Mime</a>: Much like the case of <em>X and Y</em>, this is only played straight only <em>most</em> of the time.

This leaves Tabitha and Shelly with a role in the main story that is very similar to their ascended importance in Emerald (where both were THE Dragon to their leader), though the other two Admins are not as unimportant as they were in that game due to their ascended importance in the post-game.</li><li> If you import Diancie from <em>X</em> or <em>Y</em> (via trade or Pok&eacute;mon Bank) and have it in your team when you enter a Pok&eacute;mon Center, an event is triggered very similar to the one when it was downloaded as a Mystery Gift in the previous games. Two guys come in (a Gentleman and a Black Belt) claiming their employer is looking for it, and try to convince you to give them the Diancie. Regardless of what you say, said employer (a Ninja Boy) comes in and tells them to back off, but in <em>this</em> case, he gives you the Diancite, the stone needed for its Mega Evolution.</li><li> When you show the Eon Ticket to Norman, he comments on it saying it's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">11 years since he last saw one</a>.</li><li> In Mauville Hills, there's an apartment where a scientist who dreams of giving out HM06 to trainers. In the original games, a scientist gives HM06 to the players instead of Wally's uncle.</li><li> Zinnia gives one during the Delta Episode, as a justification of sorts for not using the dimensional shifter to teleport the approaching meteoroid: she mentions the existence of another Hoenn region where Mega Evolution did not exist and none of the events that took place 3000 years ago in <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> happened. She basically summed up the original <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Sapphire</em> and <em>Emerald</em> games.</li><li> The <em>Delta Episode</em> is not the first time in the franchise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonRescueTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonRescueTeam">where Rayquaza's power has been called upon to destroy a meteor to save the world...</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">My Rules Are Not Your Rules</a>:<ul><li> Surfing Ace Trainers finally make a debut in these games. However, none of their Pok&eacute;mon you battle know the move.</li><li> Mega Rayquaza does not need a stone to Mega Evolve, unlike any other Mega Pok&eacute;mon (storywise, Rayquaza has a special "mikado organ" in its body having the same function as a Mega Stone). It only needs to know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Dragon Ascent</a>, which also means that it is the only Mega Pok&eacute;mon that can use another boosting item like a Life Orb.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a>: Downplayed.

While its only mentioned once in <em>Alpha Sapphre</em>, it is mentioned again in <em>Omega Ruby</em> when Groudon is going to Sootopolis; Archie explicitly states that everything will die if they don't stop the drought.</li><li> Also averted in Mt.

A female Pok&eacute; Fan says, "Once you die, everything will be gone..."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsTravelsFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsTravelsFast">News Travels Fast</a>: <em>Everything</em> you do is immediately reported on the BuzzNav. Save the world? On the news. Sneak up to a Pok&eacute;mon rustling in the bushes in the middle of nowhere? Someone is timing how fast it took you to approach it, and whether you ran away, defeated it, or caught it. Fight a reporter and camera man looking for a scoop? You're the scoop. Set a new trend in Dewford Town? Not only will the entire island be celebrating it by the time you take two steps into the house next to the guy you told the trend about, but you'll be on the news being credited as the trend setter. Buy a certain item in huge bulk? You're reported on the news as a shopper who knows a good deal when you see one. In fact, the news even lampshades the importance of your presence in the story by mentioning how you're the very trainer who's been appearing in so many of the news stories lately. The trope is played straight even before you get involved in the story too. The news will inform you of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Professor Cozmo</span>'s kidnapping before you learn about it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">No Fair Cheating</a>:<ul><li> Just like in <em>X and Y</em>, Pok&eacute;mon with Contest Ribbons from Generations III or IV with have those ribbons converted into special commemoratory ones that identify how many they had before, probably to prevent people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">jumpstarting their contest career</a>. Then again, you could just trade with someone whose Pok&eacute;mon has already won a contest in another copy of the game, right? Nope, because the ranks you are allowed to enter in are now tied to the player instead of the Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> Like the other <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> games for the DS family of systems, changing the internal clock will pause all time-related events and berry growth for 24 hours.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a>: Averted for the first time in the series. The opposite gender rival is heavily implied throughout the story to be the player character's love interest. Not only that, but it's possible for the BuzzNav to outright state you have a love interest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">No OSHA Compliance</a>: Probably the biggest offender in this version is Sea Mauville, a wrecked, half-sunken, half-flooded offshore rig leaning on its side with dangerous-looking holes in the floor...which is <em>open to tourists</em>! Justified due to it being designated as a nature reserve in-story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a>:<ul><li> The Scorched Slab (which in the previous version was a tiny cave that had nothing but the Sunny Day TM) is much bigger in this version. However, there seems to be nothing at all in the dark cavern (except some Golbat) but there is a rock blocking the way down to the lowest level that you need Strength to move. Do so early in the game and go down and you'll find...nothing. Just a big, empty ominous cavern. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, if you go to the Scorched Slab after dealing with Kyogre/Groundon, you'll find Flannery down there looking for Heatran, and if you go to the bottom level then, you'll find a portal that leads to Heatran itself.</span></li><li> When you enter one of the rooms in Sea Mauville, the narration tells you "You're being watched!" but the room seems empty aside from some junk and broken furniture. If you inspect an old locker, you find some barely readable files that mention a Odd Keystone; if you go in and out of a menu, a Spiritomb appears, and battles you.</li><li> One of the apparently vacant rooms in Mauville Hills has a great deal on the lease. Ringing the intercom of an empty room usually gives the message "There's no answer..." The intercom of this room instead gives "..."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">Not Rare Over There</a>: <em>XY</em> introduces Mega Evolution and gives the impression that Key Stones are quite rare. There's only one Mega Ring for the most deserving among the protagonist's friends, and Korrina, Diantha and Lysandre are the only other people who have Key Stones. Meanwhile (several years before) in Hoenn, they are relatively abundant, with the protagonist, Wally, Brendan/May, Matt, Courtney, Archie, Maxie, Lisia, Zinnia, the Elite Four, and Steven owning one. Sidney mentions in the post-game that Steven found a bunch of Key Stones and gave one to each of the Elite Four.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>: If you show one of the members of Game Freak a Pok&eacute;mon originating from the original <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em>, he'll give you a special certificate to display in your Secret Base. You can only have one at a time, but you can bring any Gen III Hoenn Pok&eacute;mon to the director after obtaining the certificate to change which Pok&eacute;mon is named and depicted (with its original GBA sprite) on it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousPipeOrgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousPipeOrgan">Ominous Pipe Organ</a>: The interior of the Sky Pillar is filled with foreboding pipe organ music, remixed from the aforementioned <em>Emerald</em> theme.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth">Optional Stealth</a>: <em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> introduces sneaking up on wild Hidden Pok&eacute;mon. This is not a requirement for any part of the story; the protagonist can even botch the rival's sneaking tutorial without having to redo it. However, some Pok&eacute;mon only appear as Hidden, so you'll need to sneak up on a few 'mons if you're gonna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">catch 'em all.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrchestralBombing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrchestralBombing">Orchestral Bombing</a>: The remixed soundtrack in the remakes slightly tones down the trumpets that dominated the originals and adds a more booming orchestral oomph to it. It is perhaps most noticeable with the Team Aqua/Magma theme.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedEtymology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedEtymology">Orphaned Etymology</a>: A Team Aqua Grunt mentions the Greek God Poseidon within the demo in spite of the fact that Classical Mythology might not even exist within the Pok&eacute;mon universe. Unless the in-universe Poseidon and Kyogre are one and the same, that is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalmtreePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalmtreePanic">Palmtree Panic</a>: The Battle Resort is found on a tropical island.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a>: Two examples, one very serious, the other played for laughs.<ul><li> The serious example: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After you tame Rayquaza and defeat Deoxys, Zinia "retires" and passes the duties of the last of the Draconians to you. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo">she leaves to go somewhere</a>, but you can talk to her grandmother in Meteor Falls to gain the Salamencite, and also make Rayquaza relearn Dragon's Ascent again.

In particular, making a base with a full team of Blisseys all knowing nothing but Healing Wish, a move that KOs the user as long as it is not the last Pok&eacute;mon left, is an effective and perfectly safe way to train weak Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>:<ul><li> Unlike the original games this is averted for the Master Ball with the Team Hideout, akin to <em>Emerald</em>. You even need to trek into the boss' office during the Delta Episode, making it extremely unlikely that you'll miss the ball pile.</li><li> As it was in the originals but not <em>Emerald</em>, Southern Island is forever off-limits once you catch the Lati twins.</li><li> Nobody in Mossdeep Gym apart from the guide and the leaders can be accessed or interacted with once you win the Mind Badge due to how the maze is set up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMeansFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMeansFeminine">Pink Means Feminine</a>: The female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> wears a frilly pink outfit for Pok&eacute;mon Contests. There's also a female Cosplay Pikachu whose clothing options include a similar outfit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt">Pixel Hunt</a>: There are still items hidden underneath the ocean bed. There's no hint on where they are as the Dowsing Machine can't be used underwater this time. Even the spots themselves aren't obvious.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostFinalBoss">Post-Final Boss</a>: May/Brendan challenges you to a battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">at the pond in Route 103</a> right after the credits roll for the first time. They now have access to Mega Evolution for their starter, but the fight shouldn't be difficult since their team is mostly out-leveled by Sidney (the first member of the Elite Four). The fight mostly exists to wrap-up the rival's character arc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreexistingEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreexistingEncounters">Preexisting Encounters</a>: In addition to the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>, wild Pok&eacute;mon can sometimes be seen in the overworld, which can only be fought if players sneak up on them. These encounters can also be spawned at will by searching for a Pok&eacute;mon with the DexNav. As a Pok&eacute;mon is encountered more, Pok&eacute;mon found with the DexNav will have more perks such as perfect IVs, Hidden Abilities, and Egg Moves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpMount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpMount">Power Up Mount</a>: There are three Pok&eacute;mon in this game that get a unique model for surfing and diving: Wailmer, Sharpedo &amp; Kyogre. Wailmer provides no extra bonuses, Sharpedo goes twice as fast as the others while sacrificing the ability to fish, and Kyogre goes slightly faster than Wailmer and miscellaneous Pok&eacute;mon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">but is too large to fit into anything but the Sootopolis Cave while underwater</a>.<ul><li> Despite this, a Wailord can fit perfectly well even though Kyogre can't, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

However, capturing every Pok&eacute;mon in the area, including the ones you encounter after getting the National Pok&eacute;dex grants you a Platinum Crown.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong">Rearrange the Song</a>: Fortree's music is rearranged twice. <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/T8J_6woQiH8">one for the Secret bases<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/YfPaBPfaU00">one for the town itself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCanon">Recursive Canon</a>: While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsoleCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsoleCameo">Console Cameo</a> of what platform the current Pok&eacute;mon game is on being hold by overworld NPCs (implying that they're playing Pok&eacute;mon on their handhelds) were largely left out as of the fifth generation, two children within the Pok&eacute;mon Trainer School of Rustboro City, as well as the quadruplets that live in Lilycove City, can still be seen with 3DS's.

Come these games, and not only do the Pok&eacute;mon who were retconned to be at least part-Fairy keep said retconned typing, the Fairy Tale Girls are added to various routes and speak of Fairy-typed Pok&eacute;mon as if they've been known for a while. This is in spite of the fact that these games come before <em>X and Y</em> in the series' timeline.</li><li> To tie the Weather Trio, the Delta Episode, and the origins of Mega Evolution together, Sootopolis has been changed from a dead volcano to the crash site of a massive meteor that unveiled an abundant well of natural energy.</li><li> The only Pok&eacute;dex descriptions that differ from the original games are those of Groudon, Kyogre and Rayquaza, which were altered to accommodate their newly expanded backstory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshaded</a> when you go speak to a certain Devon Corp. employee and ask him about his research on Rayquaza.

It <em>might</em> be a regular DS, but given that Sea Mauville shut down decades prior it's more than likely something like a dual screen Game &amp; Watch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/TwitchPlaysPokemonRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/TwitchPlaysPokemonRed">Pidgeotite is given to the player in the same room as a large, framed picture of an Omanyte.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a>: Chaz in the Pok&eacute;mon Contests. He claims that he wants to be Lisia's (and to a lesser extent, your) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival</a> in the competitions, but he will most likely come in 4th place when you actually compete against him. In fact, he seems to lack even a basic understanding of how different types of Pok&eacute;mon relate to each contest; his star is a Machoke, but he adamantly refuses to enter it in the Toughness contests (where a Machoke would likely do best) claiming it's far too "lovely" for such a competition.

He speaks highly of one he offers for 40,000 Pok&eacute;Dollars, even higher of one for 80,000, and highest of one for 150,000. But all three are Hard Stones. Two items he sells, which he claims are "for beginners" and tries to steer you away from, only cost 1,500; these are the Mega Evolution stones for the two Starters you did <em>not</em> choose.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">Socialization Bonus</a>: Like in the original games, you can share your Super Secret Bases (via StreetPass and QR codes), except it grants even more bonuses this time. The trainers you defeat in bases can be recruited into a team of yours, and can grant you bonuses like being able to make eggs hatch faster, or experience boosts. Flags you can capture in other players' bases grant similar bonuses; the more flags you have, the better the bonuses are and the more you can use them each day. Furthermore, you can even set your team members as trainers in your own secret base, effectively creating your own gym.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceSuitsAreSCUBAGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceSuitsAreSCUBAGear">Space Suits Are SCUBA Gear</a>: The Aqua Suit, which lets the player safely ride Kyogre at the bottom of the ocean, has a couple of tubes, one running around the helmet and one connecting to the back, which is presumably where the air supply is. It also functions as a space suit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After the Delta Episode, you can find a female Aqua Grunt and a male Magma Grunt in a house at the Battle Resort, who claim they've quit their teams to be together. However, after other Grunts arrive and tell them that hostilities between the two Teams is getting worse, the two decide to go back to try to make peace between the Teams and offer you a Camerupt and a Sharpedo in return, each holding a rather rare Berry.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticRoleExchangeableCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticRoleExchangeableCharacter">Static Role, Exchangeable Character</a>: The game features two possible player characters, Brendan (male) and May (female), letting the player decide who to play as. The other possible PC then becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> to the player, with largely the same role, regardless who it is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>:<ul><li> An Ace Trainer in Rustboro City will give you a Float Stone, which halves the weight of the Pok&eacute;mon that equips it.

There are also Primal Reversion forms of Groudon and Kyogre, which are different from Mega Evolution and trigger automatically upon sending in the Pok&eacute;mon if it is holding the proper item. Mega Evolutions can also be performed in Contests now, to blow the audience away even more.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills">Super Not-Drowning Skills</a>: The remakes finally avert this for the player; to dive underwater and not drown, you're given a miniature oxygen tank and goggles. Underwater trainers also feature gear similar to this. The Pok&eacute;mon still play it straight, however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>: Just like Zekrom/Reshiram in <em>Black and White</em>, and Xerneas/Yveltal in <em>X and Y</em>, you are forced to catch Rayquaza to proceed with the Delta Episode. Just like in those games, to make capture easier, Rayquaza's base capture rate is 45 instead of 3. Unlike in those games, however, you don't have the option to send it to the PC and proceed without it&mdash;you <em>have</em> to send one of your other Pok&eacute;mon back to the PC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">Take Your Time</a>: Taken to ridiculous extremes. In the Delta Episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deoxys' meteor will hit the Earth in approximately 42 hours</span>, but you can level-grind a week's worth without batting an eye in the game.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>: Implied to be the case with Genesect if you were to transfer it to these games due to the implications that they are near the very beginning of the series timeline. (Genesect's backstory involves N of Team Plasma<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note219ft2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note219ft2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note219ft2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a criminal organization that became active, with N as the leader, just before the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em>, a game near the end of the timeline</span> cancelling the project involving its creation, only for it to be secretly completed by the scientist in charge of it).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>: Wally goes from a timid frail boy who needs help from Norman to capture Ralts into a strong trainer fully capable of testing the player's limits if unprepared.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a>: It's implied a few times that the characters within this game are actually speaking within the Pok&eacute;mon world's equivalent to Japanese.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TronLines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TronLines">Tron Lines</a>: The "Cleverness" intro of your Pok&eacute;mon in the Pok&eacute;mon Contests shows a circuit board lighting up in the background.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a>:<ul><li> The Glass Workshop on route 113 requires you to collect grams of volcanic ash from the 7 ash piles found on the route. The Elegant Desk the glass maker can create for you requires about 8,000 grams of ash, and the Elegant Chair about 6,000. You get between 35-105 grams every time you go back outside and collect the 7 piles again, so getting both furniture items for your secret base is going to take quite a bit of repetitious grinding.</li><li> There's something similar if you want your Secret Base to be as useful as possible. Getting it to Bronze level, where your friends have higher level Pok&eacute;mon when you battle them and can do two skills, requires gathering 30 flags from other Bases. Getting it to Silver (making their Pok&eacute;mon even better and giving them three Skills) requires you to gather 100 flags (total). You need a total of 500 to get it up to Gold, where you can have the best base, and you need 1000 flags to gain the Platinum rank, which not only allows you to use special skills of your Secret Base Pals twice a day, it's also the only way to get the Garchompite without trading. (And because there are only 80 Secret Bases in Hoenn and you can only get one flag from each per day - if it's occupied - it may take a while.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleSmile">Twinkle Smile</a>: During the cutscene where Maxie/Archie summons Groudon/Kyogre, he'll turn to the player and grin in his triumph. It's a little hard to make out, but his teeth definitely twinkle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">The Unreveal</a>: Regarding the number of years that pass between some of the games. Looking at the description of the model of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Royal Unova</a> in the Slateport City Museum says that it's "scheduled to be completed in &mdash; years. The number is too small to read."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>:<ul><li> Pok&eacute;mon-Amie returns from <em>X &amp; Y</em>. Just like in those games, you can pet, feed, and play with your Pok&eacute;mon, which can grant quite a few bonuses if you keep on doing it.</li><li> There's a Youngster on an early route whose Pok&eacute;mon has been injured. You have the option of healing it for him with one of your Potions for nothing in return.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a>: The game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwaves</a> portraying the cutscene on top of Sky Pillar at night, <em>then</em> jumping to daytime by Zinnia knocking you unconscious, which raises the question on why she did so in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VortexBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VortexBarrier">Vortex Barrier</a>: Downplayed. The player is unable to access the desert blocking half of one route, as the desert is covered by constant sandstorms. This sandstorm never goes away, but the player can eventually enter the desert after obtaining the Go-Goggles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">We Used to Be Friends</a>: Archie and Maxie were on the same "team" once, according to an NPC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: Team Magma and Aqua both have good intentions for their actions like in the original games, except they've been expanded upon so their motives are more sensible this time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality">White-and-Grey Morality</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Heroes</a> are trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld">Save the World</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Groudon and Kyogre</a>, who will destroy the world if one of them is awakened.

In <em>ORAS</em>, it's an "extra" Legendary Pok&eacute;mon exclusive to <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> and has no bearing on the main plot (Ho-Oh, which serves as its counterpart in <em>Omega Ruby</em>, didn't receive the same kind of marketing and didn't appear in the movie).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar">You All Look Familiar</a>: The women who guards the entrance to the cable car and the woman who gives out tickets both look similar. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshaded</a> by a hiker on the upper cable car house who claims that the ones at the top are twins while the ones at the bottom are also twins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>: Just try to walk away from Professor Birch at the beginning:<div class="indent"><strong>Professor Birch:</strong> Wh-where are you going?!
