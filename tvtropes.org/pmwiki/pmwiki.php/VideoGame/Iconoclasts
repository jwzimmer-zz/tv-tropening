In a larger sense, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the panic and strife over the Starworm's return ends up not mattering either, since Robin still kicks its ass</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: The official names of two late-game bosses (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cat Mother rides on is named Oedipuss after her pet cat, and Black's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form is the Ivory Beast</span>) can only be found on the game's soundtrack.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheWorldsAreAStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheWorldsAreAStage">All the Worlds Are a Stage</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Impact Zone</span> consists of several rooms themed after previous locations, each containing enemies from previous areas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">infested with the blue eyes</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Omega Controller</span> constantly causes the terrain to cycle through the different area textures as you ascend the elevator shaft.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base Are Belong to Us</a>: Barely a few hours pass between Robin, Mina and Royal getting to Isilugar, and the attack on it by the One Concern. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It gets moved to prevent them from sending back-up down there, and the whole battle works out well for the Isi, but disastrous for the One Concern, since the only person to die in the battle is Agent White, earlier considered to be nigh-immortal. They also lose ten soldiers prisoner, while Isi only lose Samba, who is eventually recovered by Mina anyway.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>:<ul><li> Take time to grieve over the deaths of your loved ones and those close to you. If you don't, you may act irrationally and lash out in ways you'll later regret. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This bites both Elro and Agent Black <em>hard.</em> Elro makes a huge mistake that essentially kickstarts the conflict of the game because he didn't think rationally when Agent Grey was simply asking him to calm down and Agent Black slowly goes off the deep end demonizing Elro and Robin for what Elro did instead of taking Chrome's advice and taking time to come to terms with the death of Grey.</span></li><li> Don't let what's expected of you or indoctrinated into you cause you to ignore what's right, but at the same time, don't let your ego prevent you from seeing right and wrong clearly in the first place. Each of the supporting characters are weighed down by what is expected of them (or what they expect of others) and what that costs them personally, while wrestling with their own selfish impulses that only make things worse: Robin, on the flipside, is characterized by her staunch devotion to whatever she can do to help regardless of what anyone thinks, and her sense of self-sacrifice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a>: It's heavily implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all of the humans are descendants of colonists who migrated from Earth to an alien planet. The Isi found and recovered an ancient colony ship which they revere as a sacred artifact, and their city has paintings of known human landmarks such as the Taj Mahal. The Concern similarly have a colony ship in their possession which they use for research purposes. Hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CypherLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CypherLanguage">alien text</a> hints that the planet that the game takes place on was originally a fuel depot for birdlike starship pilots, and at least one of them has visited the planet before</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>: It's implied that being possessed by the blue eye creatures feels like this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's further implied that if Starworm was alive, and not just a mech, then this is what it felt for untold years as the pilot controlled it through the blue eyes. If so, then the pilot being killed by the Starworm "malfunctioning" and attacking him instead of you might not have been a malfunction at all, but the Starworm regaining control over its body and spending its last moments before death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">getting revenge on the asshole who enslaved it to use as a spaceship</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">And Now for Someone Completely Different</a>:<ul><li> One part of Ferrier Shockwood is played entirely as Mina after she gets separated from Robin and Elro, complete with her own boss fight against a Controller. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She gets another unique segment during One Concern East, which ends with the Mendeleev fight.</span></li><li> Elro gets a segment during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One Concern East as well, though most of it is him limping through the hallway with only a few enemies present. He fights Lawrence at the end of it</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antepiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antepiece">Antepiece</a>: When Robin arrives at City One, she's stopped by a gatekeeper, and the only way to get past him is to use the Usurper's charge shot, which pulls him off the high platform and onto the ground. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This weakness is shared with Mother, the boss fought a few minutes after this scene.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>:<ul><li> Normally, Robin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> goes straight down. However, it has a mild homing effect on enemies, meaning that you'll still land the hit if your aim is slightly off.</li><li> During boss fights, incidental dialogue said by the NPC heroes will give hints as to how to defeat them. For instance, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a> fight in City One, Mina will shout "come down here, coward!" at the boss, hinting that you need to use the Usurper's charge shot to bring them to the ground. These hints will also be highlighted in red text for you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis">notice exactly what you need to do</a>.</li><li> In Challenge Mode, Lawrence takes six hits to defeat instead of twelve. Very convenient for a fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">where one mistake means repeating it</a> and you're playing as Elro, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">extremely slow but quite strong</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>:<ul><li> The Isi's seeds have extremely volatile reactions when exposed to Ivory, making them grow instantaneously; this makes them an excellent tool for wrecking Concern technology, which is reliant on Ivory. Royal also notes that even though his powers allow him to control plants enough to sprout them in the middle of the desert at will, he is completely unable to affect the plants grown from these seeds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Royal's powers work by manipulating the Ivory in an object, but the Isi plants don't have any Ivory in them because they're from Earth</span>. They also work disturbingly well on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">humans who have been injected with Ivory, being used to take out Agent White and Mother (Agent Black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">resists their effects</a> until the blue eyes mutate her). When Robin jams a seed into the Starworm, the resulting explosion causes a wave of nature to overtake the whole planet.</span></li><li> Detritus is a pinkish-purple powder that is produced whenever an object is drained of its Ivory. It is very much anti-Ivory, negating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ivory-infused individuals</span> and, in the case of Royal, completely shutting down his powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Black kills Royal in a pit of Detritus at the end of One Concern West (she planned to kill Chrome there, but he had other plans), though he revives himself shortly after his body leaves the room. Elro's work with the ChemiCo Contra led to him inventing a serum that instantly removes Ivory from matter and turns it into Detritus, which is one of the few things that can kill Transcended humans.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>: Ivory is used to power all technology and the Concern's stranglehold on it is the basis for their control of all society besides the pirates/Isi, who get it from underwater Ivory pustules. It can function as a battery for a home, a component to be used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a source of immortality and superpowers for those with the necessary constitution</span>, and ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gasoline for some alien bird's space truck</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>: "This is bigger than you."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limbs</a>: At first, they appear as simply a necessary attribute of an agent. Agent White has cybernetic eyes that allow him to shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>, and Agent Black is revealed to have cybernetic arms. Eventually, Royal reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">any individual who survives Transcendence but doesn't perfectly merge with the Ivory like Mother and Royal did will end up with a certain body part consumed by the Ivory.

Life in Isilugar is more relaxed and free, with the Isi religion being all about love and reproduction. That last part has a catch, however. Turns out the Isi religion is not perfect, either. Arranged marriages are common, and procreation is seen as a vital responsibility of every adult, which means that people who are unable or unwilling to reproduce, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like Doctor Gustavo, who doesn't want to pass on his genetic disease</span>, are seen as outcasts, through no fault of their own.

In the preceding cutscene, Mina laments that she's lost her seeds and can't blow up the office's gate; Robin picked up the seeds while she was infiltrating the tower, so this seems to hint that Robin must figure out how to use the seeds or hand them over to Mina.

The hiding spots are sequenced and she sometimes only appears after enough story progression, making it more confusing. After the final encounter, you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">swim to the secret cavern deep within Glass Strait</span>; the only hint for this is that Leticia's flag is on the water's surface, but it's in an area that has little purpose otherwise.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mother's Corners</span> can only be fought at the <em>very</em> end of the game after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Starworm crash-lands in Blockrock</span>, where it really doesn't seem like there&#146;s anything else to do (unless you notice a missing space in the tweak collection box).
