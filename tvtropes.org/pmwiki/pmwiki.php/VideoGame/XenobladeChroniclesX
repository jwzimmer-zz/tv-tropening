However, if a certain required enemy proves too difficult during said mission (such as defeating a large creature with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">prototype Skell rifle</a> on foot), the game offers to lower that enemy's level a bit after you die against it a certain number of times.</li><li> If a mission requires a certain piece of gear to be equipped, anyone in your party can do so - no need to switch classes and handle it personally.</li><li> The game remembers the arts and skills you had equipped for each class.

You still need to hunt down collectable materials the old way, but they're much easier to find in large amounts and to respawn than in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">previous game</a>.</li><li> Your AI-controlled party members tend to wreck their Skells. However, they always eject their Skells perfectly, preventing them from wasting Skell insurance if there's any left.</li><li> The AI in general isn't nearly as effective as a player can be; they don't acknowledge high ground or environmental hazards, and have a difficult time binding larger enemies in their Skells. Fortunately there are commands that you can use to circumvent this, such as gathering the party around the player or having the party avoid binding in order to let the player do it instead.</li><li> Aggressive enemies won't attack you if you're ten levels higher than them, unless they're an ambush type enemy who springs up when you approach it, like Mortifoles and Thalluses. Tyrants will also do this.</li><li> If enough time passes between play sessions, every Skell's fuel is fully restored, allowing you to use all of it up right before you plan to end your current play session.</li><li> You can't save after crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>, to prevent you from being totally hosed if you went into the battle underprepared and unable to defeat the final boss.</li><li> There's a separate slot for equipping fashion gear.

This allows for customization without having to worry about your character's appearance or stats.</li><li> Affinity missions required to progress through the main story (namely Lao's and Gwin's) only require one heart's worth of affinity to start at most, compared to the three or four hearts required for later, optional affinity missions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Anti-Grinding</a>:<ul><li> Experience earnings are calculated by the base experience of the enemy and the difference in levels between the defeated enemy and your party members.

Here are some examples:<ul><li> An AI teammate piloting a Skell seldom manages to be able to bind an enemy for more than a second. For reference, how long an enemy can be subject to the bind debuff is determined by the QTE system much like how Soul Voices work, so it isn't too hard to begin with.</li><li> Teammates <em>cannot</em> identify an enemy's reflect barrier, meaning that they'll often just keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">damaging themselves</a> with an attack element the enemy is reflecting.</li><li> Teammates can't recognize terrain properties, meaning that they will charge into deep water (where they can't fight back), stand on damaging surfaces, position themselves to be knocked off cliffs, and take no advantage of inclines or higher ground.</li><li> Teammates will use Area of Effect attacks when only fighting a single opponent. At best just drawing in a few more opponents. At worst drawing in an otherwise non aggressive high level opponent (most famously Luciel the Eternal, a gigantic level 92 tyrant with an equally gigantic hit box who wanders through a few starting zones.) Luckily you can selectively deactivate moves which your party members will use to prevent this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">Artistic License &#150; Economics</a>: The prices of certain items can be a bit peculiar. In one affinity mission, you have to buy 10 Pizzas for the Ma-Non, which cost 10,000 credits, which would make you think that one credit is worth as much one Japanese yen (though it could be just that Pizzas are in high demand, thanks to the Ma-Non). Yet, in another mission you have to buy a car which is around 10,000 credits and in yet another mission, it takes 30,000 credits to sign a treaty with a nopon caravan (Though the dealer says that it's a good bargain). So we're suppose to believe that a pizza cost one tenth of a car, which cost one third of public treaty. Possibly justified in that NLA is an entirely new society, and the value of credits is determined by each person individually, so they can charge whatever they want.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drone</a>: Psycho launchers used by the Blast Fencer/Galactic Knight.

So they're highlighted by the accompaniment of <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgudF-hVlDA">"Uncontrollable"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, instead of the game's usual battle theme.

The Hexad Partican is probably the most obvious example of this, since it's the only Superweapon you can get without having to make it yourself, it takes up the aforementioned 4 slots to equip, costs 1200 fuel a shot, and a good number of weapons do the same thing it does except better and with just 2 slots. Dragoon Lance is another such example since it also takes up 4 slots to equip and you rarely if ever come across a group of normal enemies that can survive the entire attack, but it's also too weak to take out singular Tyrants on its own: you also can't move or use other attacks when it's in use and it takes 10 seconds until the attack is finished.</li><li> A real-life scenario. Due to the hardware limitations of the Wii U, having the recommended downloads for optimal performance such as smooth transitions and consistent frame rate requires a whopping 22 <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GBs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GBs">G Bs</a> of disk space.

Besides the obvious pair of Ultrafauna, there's also Lugalbanda, the Wanderer King; Nardacyon, the Shadowless; Vortice, the Deific Blast; and Dadaan, the Strongest Prone. All of them get an alternative battle theme and range from level 77 to 96. There are also several other high-level Tyrants that have unusual battle traits and get special descriptive text in the Enemy Index, such as a sheperd Sylooth who tends Ovis, a pair of gargantuan Sabula, a Xern outfitted with defensive drones, and a Millesaur that's missing its neck. Some of these don't spawn until the game has been beaten.</li><li> The Divine Nopopon mission features three colossal enemies, two of which are placed in the most dangerous caves imaginable.

Stay away until you have enough firepower, but remember that even if you're on even or superior ground, they can still put up a fight. For example, one particular Tyrant &mdash; Sirene, the Lost &mdash; is a level 13 Lepyx in Primordia that looks exactly like normal Lepyxes, save being much bigger, but the fact that it's killed over <strong>300,000 players</strong> and earned a gold crown in kill count speaks volumes that this thing is <em>not</em> something you want to mess with early on. Equally nasty is Oskar, the Summer Squall, which is only level 11 and is just as lethal, especially when it one-shots your party with Ether Field just after you think you've got it.</li><li> Large enemies early on can become these, as they have colossal amounts of health and deal lots of damage, with some having access to nasty attacks. Don't think you can handle a large enemy like a Cinicula or Progen just because you're the same level as it; some of them can be a minutes-long struggle even for teams ten levels above them. This goes double for large Tyrants. And good luck if <em>multiples</em> of them show up.</li><li> One of the Bismuth Xe-doms in Sylvalum is level <strong>92</strong>, on par with Luciel, the Eternal, whereas all the other Xe-doms patrolling the region are 42-55 at most. The only thing different about it, besides its stats, is that it's being escorted by a pair of Oc-serv.</li><li> Filiavents are giant anemone-like indigens who are level 55 <em>at the least</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pytd');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0pytd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pytd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not counting squad missions</span>, are huge, fly out of reach of your attacks, attack with extremely powerful electrical-element attacks, have very high stats, and are ambush-types and so will attack no matter what.</li><li> The Jacul and Auravis tyrant classes have powerful and difficult to dodge attacks all of which will hit you it you are next to it. Below the tyrant's level? You are absolutely dead. At the same level? Still very likely to die. Overleveled? Will still be able to kill you if you are careless. Bring a skell? You will have an easier time but these things hit like trucks going at 90mph and you can still end up saying goodbye to your insurance.</li><li> Vainamo, the Bellower is a level 39 Vigent Tyrant that has offensive stats similar to the level <strong>58</strong> Volcannon Vigents nearby, and over twice as much health. One mid-game mission requires you to defeat it. Good luck, as it can take a serious beating even from level 50 Skell frames.</li><li> Xerns are without a doubt the strongest normal enemy type. The lowest-leveled normal variant (and only non-Tyrant variant) is level <strong>75</strong>.

As a result, though the mission ostensibly ends with Rock remaining a pacifist, the fact that he only moments ago relented to fight out of guilt is brushed aside. As is the fact that he was doing it to save Celica, who is now an active BLADE soldier despite being less capable in combat than <em>he</em> is.

For example, the Wrothians have great praise for one of their warriors when she takes off alone to satisfy her need for vengeance against the Ganglion, with the full knowledge that she is almost certain to die from such an attack. In Japanese, this is known as "Makoto", whereas someone who is under obligation to redeem honor or act upon an intense emotion (or, as in this case, both) is supposed to act without thinking of logic or consequences. This is why attempting to appeal to the logic of said warrior, to stop her from killing herself, will fail.

Movement is fairly slow, which combined with the immense world means it takes a <em>long</em> time to get to places. The world is littered with enemies that you won't be able to have a fair fight against for hours, and you'll be sneaking around a lot of them. Getting killed while trying to explore uncharted territory before finding a node or landmark and losing all that progress is an all-too-real possibility. Weapon choices are relatively limited, and aside from a few Arts, you won't have other elemental types besides Physical. Decent healing skills are also <em>very</em> hard to come by.

For early-to-mid-game player (who cannot afford these risks/setbacks), this can actually make traveling/fighting in Skells more nail-biting and frustrating than fighting on foot, since you can be in the middle of something and get suddenly one-shotted and find your Skell destroyed.

Except, in any cutscene where she has a speaking role, Elma instantly becomes the leader. For example, there's L's, Celica's, and Gwin's first Affinity Missions, which amounts to the team just helping out those characters and not being on any type of assignment. It can become <em>really</em> noticeable, though, when Elma gets credit for a lot of things that you accomplished without her needing to be in the group whatsoever. For example, his Affinity Mission has Nagi state that he's been serving under Elma for some time. Except that, when you add him to the party, he says it was <em>you</em> he wanted to serve under. This is possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">an artifact</a> from early production design, in which there was no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a>, and so the team leader and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> were likely the same person.</li><li> In the Affinity Mission, "Boot Camp", Gwin says that he is too weak and wants to train. Elma then wants to fight him to see how "weak" he is. When you fight him, he is level 40, when it is highly unlikely you trained Gwin to level 40 by the time you do this Affinity Mission. Then Elma tasks Gwin to do some missions with her (or Rook's) team, and his levels drop back down to what they are when he is a regular party member. After you and Gwin do those missions, Gwin takes another battle with your party. In this fight, he is now level <em>46</em>. Somehow a BLADE can all-the-sudden grow by 6 levels just by doing some missions from Elma.</li><li> Elma, Doug and Lao are all shown to be Skell pilots before joining your party, but until you get <em>your</em> Skell License, you can't even have them support you with their own Skells. Similarly, despite a big deal being made about Skells being a limited resource, you can buy as many as you have credits for, and can even hand them out to inexperienced BLADEs such as Phog or L.</li><li> The fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">L and Celica</span> can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Overdrive</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's heavily implied that Overdrive is a function of the characters' robotic bodies, since you can't use it until after the reveal, and the icon depicts a set of gears. Despite being flesh and blood, both L and Celica are somehow capable of using it, too.</span></li><li> You can take Celica and L with you on the initially racist Boz&eacute;'s recruitment mission and he doesn't seem to care at all. Being nice to non-humans in conversation also raises his affinity as much as any other character.</li><li> A female Orphean may appear as the client for a Basic Mission before completing the Mission where they are brought into existence.</li><li> In Chapter 12's cutscene, it doesn't matter what your Skells look like, because they're not the ones you're piloting. In the same cutscene, certain NPCs like Alexa and H.B. will be leading their own separate teams with the objective of holding enemy forces off while you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> secure the Lifehold Core</span>. If they were in your party they will suddenly be part of your team after the cutscene even though they were no where near you a few seconds before.</li><li> You can take any member on missions where you fight the Definians, yet most of the time in their affinity missions (i.e. Boz&eacute; and Hope), they act as if the Definian they encounter there were the first they saw.</li><li> After Chapter 5 a mission requires Rook to give a Ma-non worker some means of compensation in exchange for their technology and knowledge. Pizza is the key, and the worker immediately gets hooked. Exploring NLA before doing this still shows the Ma-non mad for pizza, even though it's often stated that it's Rook who started the Pizza fad in the first place.</li><li> It's possible to find combat probes in mechanical treasure spots before undergoing Hugo's missions, which imply that said probes are his inventions and the first of their kind.</li><li> The missions involving Alex and Fraise are required to be completed before being able to access Good Fortun, and by extent, Definian Downfall, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they both heavily involve Definians while Definian Downfall is all about finishing them off</span>. However, other such missions such as Corwin's missions, The Duel Part IV, and Slovity's Revenge, aren't required to be completed beforehand, and the Definians involved in those missions often brag about Fortun, even when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's either dead or lobotomized</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The main game's story ending heavily implies you have completed most of the affinity missions and unlocked every character in the game, even if you did not recruit the optional characters. An example is Celica's Affinity Mission: not completing New in New LA. Rock seems to be working in construction when he obtains the job after the affinity mission is completed. Then there's Mia as well, who can only become recruitable in a bonus mission.</span></li><li> It's possible to find most of the lifehold segments long before the story actually sends you looking for them but your team will never acknowledge them until the story allows it despite it apparently being a desperate search for them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a>: A subquest, once completed, will allow the player to change their character's design almost at will (it's at a single location that can only be done late at night.

Even when you start a fight in a Ganglion Base where most of the guards are within earshot and clear sight of each other, they don't take notice of what's happening unless you get their attention by attacking them or wandering into their aggro range. Using wares that have the Optical Cloaking Augment can also really make the Ganglion look woefully incompetent when it comes to guarding their facilities: You can move within 1.5 feet of a Puge, Prone, or Marnuck and they still wouldn't react to your presence, even when you're right in front of them and stealing the goods from their containers. It gets even more ridiculous when you're piloting a Skell in Cauldros: You can actually avoid fighting most of the Ganglion by moving and jumping very carefully <em>between them</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>:<ul><li> Despite the lengthy in-game manual, there's still a number of features that go completely unexplained and unmentioned: the largest one of these is the total lack of info on how much various buffs boost said stats, making it hard to decide which one of them is the best one to use, especially since the main character can ultimately learn all of them and because each buff's effect was thoroughly documented in the previous game's art list. The annoyingly small font doesn't help with any potential in-game help text either.</li><li> Not counting the Player Character, there are 18 additional party members. Seven of them are recruited over the course of the story. Ten of them require you to complete an Affinity Mission in order to unlock them. That one last party member, Mia, is a pain in the ass if you don't know what to do: you need to complete a certain chain of <em>Normal Missions</em> in order to finally unlock her, 3 of them first requiring you to find her in specific locations out in the wild, and even then the earliest point you can unlock her is right between Chapter 11 and Chapter 12, and that's only if you're ridiculously OCD about doing segment recon, as the requirement for the last quest to unlock her requires you to have 65% completion rating in Cauldros, which is the last continent.</li><li> You will get quests asking you to gather items from the overworld. However, the quests will only tell you the continent the items are on, despite most overworld items being located only in particular portions of the map (and even if you are looking in the right place, what you find is randomized). This lead many players to run around in circles for hours, hoping to find the one item they are missing to complete their quest. This can get quite infuriating when important quests require you to find such items, such as the mandatory one to get your Skell licence.</li><li> Completing the Collectopedia, a fetch quest on a much larger scale. In order to get a 100% completion, you must collect and register at least one of <em>every</em> item that spawns on map. It sounds simple enough, but items have different levels of rarity meaning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">RNG</a> plays a big factor into this. Items are also exclusive to <em>specific regions</em> within each continent and the game will not give you clues where to locate them. Also, more common in Sylvalum and Cauldros, some items can only be picked up at specific times of day with specific weather conditions. In other words, the only way to get 100% without using a guide for reference is through dumb luck.</li><li> Indigens, aliens, and mechanoids recorded in the Enemy Index only show what continent they're on, not a specific location they appear. If you want to find them again, you'll have to find a bounty mission that points out their area, or consult the Internet. The Index also records item drops from enemies, but doesn't tell you which appendage needs to be destroyed to have a chance at obtaining one. This really bites for missions that require you to obtain items from enemies. For example, the objective may tell you to get a Topaz Wine from a Clay Tectinsula in Oblivia, but it doesn't show you <em>where</em> they appear or which appendage you have to destroy to get a chance at obtaining one.</li><li> Heart-to-heart conversations and Affinity Shifts. They're not marked on FrontierNav unless you happen to pass by someone who knows the information, and even then the info isn't available until after completing certain missions. Some of them have specific requirements, such as finding the person at a certain time of day in an area they usually aren't found while they're not in your party, after completing a previous heart-to-heart with them, and sometimes having a certain type of pet in the barracks. Unless you manage to find the information or have a guide, finding the heart-to-hearts involves stumbling upon the people by pure luck or intense searching. Affinity Shifts take the above but replace "party member" with random civilians.</li><li> Getting the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">best</a>" outcome on some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Normal Missions</a> sometimes means knowing some technical bits about the world beforehand (whether it be getting random info from random unnamed NPCs with some cryptic context behind it or understanding the geography and names of different parts of the continents) or talking to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> that aren't listed in your objectives. While some actions you take to save lives are common sense (such as stepping in to defend an endangered person), being ill-prepared for some decisions (whether it be the player character not having gained info on how to do something or not having a specific item when someone's in danger) can result in negative outcomes such as the death of someone you were supposed to save. One such quest requires you to talk to another person nearby before speaking to the person the quest requires you to speak to, another quest can get another person killed if you don't do a specific part first and gain information regarding an item from them and yet another quest requires you to provide information about an enemy type's weaknesses and attacks on the fly without being given the option to check it in your enemy index beforehand so that the other party's attack won't result in casualties.</li><li> There are hexes on the continential maps that have the quest icon, indicating that either a quest mostly takes place in that area, or a quest is obtained in that area. Sometimes it's not obvious, and said missions can be easily missed (such as Conner's second quest).</li><li> The Dopang Caravan is harder to locate than the other Nopon caravans in Mira, since it doesn't have any affinity missions tied to it. It's also hidden in a secluded place in Sylvalum and the fast travel point name it uses is based on the spring nearby.</li><li> Deep in your journey you may find a mission on the BLADE terminal <em>Off the Record</em>, where navigation hints and indicators are unavailable, the hints are especially cryptic, and there can be multiple versions of this mission as well. It turns out these missions are required for getting a field skill up to level 5, and only become available upon reaching level 4 in a skill.</li><li> The weapons your current teammates use affect the type of on-foot weapon drops that you'll receive from enemies, in addition to your selected class (ie having Elma, Phog, and Celica, and being a Winged Viper or Full Metal Jaguar will increase the chances of getting Dual Guns).</li><li> Affinity relations with a border are set in stone, and are often the final stage in a relationship. Trivial, but you wouldn't know what the difference is between a link with a border and one without unless you looked it up.</li><li> The golden blatta Tyrants are <em>extremely</em> well-hidden. They're tiny and almost always hidden enemies so they don't appear on the minimap. Three appear at nighttime high above where you'd normally look, one of them rarely spawns amongst other blattas, another only shows up after defeating enemies around it, and the remainder are deep in caves.</li><li> Shuravas, the Enraged is equally obscure. Absolutely <em>nothing</em> hints to its existence, and it only appears in a specific place (Suncatch Ravine in Noctilum) during a specific weather condition (thunderstorm).</li><li> Just as obscure is Zohan, the Thunderbolt, another Tyrant that nobody alludes to and that only appears during a specific weather condition. This weather condition also happens to be the one in which <em>you can't see anything</em>. Not only that, but Zohan appears very high up <em>and</em> it can't be targeted until it spots you, though it has a huge aggro radius.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a>: The ranged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a> for Commando, Winged Viper, and Full Metal Jaguar classes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth">Half-Truth</a>:<ul><li> At face-value, Weapons that fire multiple projectiles per attack are weaker than weapons that have higher damage but fire fewer or even only one projectile.

Mortifoles and Sacrifoles disguise themselves among ordinary plants (though moving petals might tip you off); Germivores, Tectinsulas and Arenatects disguise themselves as land formations; in Sylvalum, some Cantors like to pose as perfectly stiff statues (aside from their heads turning in different directions with clock-ticking sound) next to stone walls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodOld">Hollywood Old</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge">Artistic Age</a> example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">probably</a>, but one of the face options for a male Rook is called "Old Man".

All those people can never be brought back, even though the technology to recreate bodies is still functioning. While the game doesn't go into detail about it, it's pretty obvious that Chaussen, Nagi, Vandham, and the rest of the leaders in NLA will have to choose very carefully how and when they'll break the news, because some citizens are getting impatient</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileWeather">Hostile Weather</a>:<ul><li> Electromagnetic storms can break out in Oblivia. Like other environmental hazards, it deals damage to your party, but it has the benefit of reducing mechanoids' detection ranges. It covers a sizable chunk of the whole continent, and only getting to a relatively enclosed place will stop the damage.</li><li> Cauldros has electromagnetic storms as well, albeit much more rarely than Oblivia. The real problem in Cauldros is the brimstone rain, aka <em>raining chunks of fiery rock</em>, which deals heavy damage to anyone not in a Skell or under some sort of hard cover.</li><li> Sylvalum has the spore clouds weather. Every so often, the fungus that seems to cover most of the continent releases huge amounts of spores. While they aren't harmful themselves, they reduce visibility to almost zero. This makes it nigh-impossible to tell where you're going, and practically guarantees that you'll walk right into one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">super-powerful enemies</a> wandering around.

Some of them also prove to be less then accepting of their alien visitors...sometimes to a deadly degree.</li><li> The quest to help Professor B, a friendly alien in the Industrial Sector, is a simple fetch quest to help further his research. Upon finding the item, you're ambushed by four BLADE members, led by Gadd, who don't want you to help him out, and they're ready to kill you to see it through. They attack you, and you have no choice but to kill them.<ul><li> You're forced to cross swords with Gadd again when Professor B reappears on Mira in the Oblivia Region and sends a distress call.</li></ul></li><li> Fraisie at the Chapel tries to exploit the Ma-Non into following her religion.

Unfortunately, he's not alone in his opinion.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A good bit of Lao's entire shtick as a villain stems from his view that humans are bastards <em>to each other</em>. Not only is he furious that his family was denied a place on the Whale, but he's certain it was due to their socio-economic status and stops <em>exactly</em> short of outright accusing the NLA leadership of full-blown racism in its selection process. He even goes so far as to warn Lin that "people like us" are only treated as valuable so long as they're seen as useful, which is about as subtle as a brick to the head.</span></li><li> Business for Army Pizza had been lukewarm since NLA was forced to land on Mira but all that suddenly changed when the Ma-non took up residence and began buying Pizzas non-stop. The sudden spike in patronage led to a meteoric rise in success for Army Pizza but the demand gradually proved to be too much in the short-run. Human customers for Army Pizza felt themselves driven away by the Ma-non. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Powell's wife commits suicide which drives him insane with Xenophobic sentiment, turning him into a serial killer who blames the Ma-non for her death, even though all they ever did was buy Pizzas.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite">Humans Are White</a>: Played with. Within NLA, almost every character is of fair skin, and characters like Lin and Nagi are Chinese and Japanese respectively. Other than that, due to the lack of clear skin tones and ethnic features, it's hard to tell if there any, say, Black or Alboriginal people. Many players, in fact, have complained that the character creation system does not do a good job of providing options for non-White and non-Asian characters. As such, pre-made NPCs (such as Powell at Army Pizza) are a slightly darker shade than others, but could just be tanned for all we know. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, given the tenor of some of Lao's comments during chapter 11 in particular, the marked "whiteness" of the White Whale crew may not be unintentional on the part of the developers...</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>:<ul><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zu Pharg</span>, while outwardly appearing to just be a spacecraft, turns out to be one of these.</li><li> While not nearly as huge as the previous example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Vita</span> still towers over Skells, being more then twice as as tall.</li><li> Xe-doms are some of the biggest mechanical enemies in the game.</li><li> Xerns are by far the biggest flying mechanical enemies in the game right after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zu Pharg</span> and it's more than likely that you initially mistake one as a piece of scenery as they resemble parts of the abandoned mining towers found in Cauldros.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle">Hungry Jungle</a>: Noctilum is full of overly-dense tropical plant life, acidic water, and enemies literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight">Hidden in Plain Sight</a> who don't show up on your radar until it's too late and you've already entered battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">Idiot Hair</a>: Almost every hairstyle in the character creation screen gives you the option to give your character a forelock that sticks out apart from the rest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveToGoIronMyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveToGoIronMyDog">I Have to Go Iron My Dog</a>: Frye and Phog can't both be in the party at the same time until you complete a certain Affinity quest.

Ultra Nebulan/Ultra Diamond Weapons can only be farmed from Level +61 enemies and are completely subject by random chance.

However, you can't change their equipment, meaning that outside of their augments, their power can't be increased with stronger weapons and they only have 4 weapons, meaning they'll have to wait for their cooldown that much longer to use any of them again and they miss out on a significant number of augment slots. That being said, making a normal level 60 Skell that can consistently outdamage an Ares and has overall higher stats is a massive time and materials investment and isn't really that useful for anything besides the novelty of being able to take down strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">single hit.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: Ga Jiarg and Luxaar with their titles, but in opposite ways.

Mia flirts with Doug in an after combat dialogue, who is in love with Hope (who has numerous NLA citizens in love with her), who is vaguely hinted to be in love with...you guessed it...<strong>Rook</strong>.

The Orphe and the Wrothians, in particular, make it clear that their alliance with humans are strictly a tool for survival (the Wrothian prince even flat out tells you that if there ever comes a time that Wrothian interests oppose human ones, he will void the truce immediately), but both species come to respect humanity in the meantime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">Multi-Armed and Dangerous</a>:<ul><li> Simius and Cantors have four arms.</li><li> The Telethia has six limbs; the upper two always serve as wings/arms while the lower two always serve as legs, but the middle two switch between functioning as arms or legs depending on its stance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneLuxury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneLuxury">Mundane Luxury</a>: One of Mia's Heart-to-hearts reveals that pets in NLA are this.

Heterosexuality is assumed to be the default in nearly all cases that the subject of love or sex comes up&mdash;especially in regards to alien species.

A few late-game missions mandate Skell use and show everyone in their cockpits, but most missions just assume you're walking up on foot even if your entire team is in Skells. This means you walk up to the cutscene point in your Skell, somehow hop out of your Skell for the cutscene, draw your ground weapon for a fight, and then get inexplicably teleported back into your Skell the instant the cutscene is done with the game not missing a beat. A few standout examples:<ul><li> This gets <em>especially</em> weird in Chapter 8. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You're defending New LA from Ganglion attack, okay, sure... and the cutscenes imply you're helping to hold the gate and later clear the city on foot. Not only is this a full chapter after you get the ability to unlock at <em>least</em> a starter Skell (and has a level limit that puts you exactly at level to get a "proper" Skell and get Elma and Lin into Skells too, if they match yours) but <em>literally everyone else defending New LA is using a Skell</em>. The only other non-Skell folks are Lao's team, and that's because they're defending the relic mech inside a hangar. And yet, if you bring the Skells you almost certainly have, and which the scale of the crisis rather suggests you bring, it doesn't get acknowledged at all and you're apparently ground-pounding for some reason while everyone else is in robots, including Team Irina, who otherwise <em>need to bum your Skells when they're on your team</em>.</span></li><li> Chapter 9 also gets fairly strange about this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once again you have Skells and are heading into hostile territory, which rather passively suggests you should bring the robots for this run. You have to dismount to talk to Lao, which is a fair enough do, but you're then shown walking into Sylvalum on foot regardless of your robot status. You then reach the ambush point, and this time you're once again just shown as being on foot, regardless of Skell status, and are detained. You then have the duel with Jiarg, the first part of which is absolutely mandated as a foot battle - and when the second part begins and he summons his Skell... he tells you to "arm yourselves as you wish", and doesn't aggro immediately when you gain control. And your Skells are once again available to board. It's a very <em>odd</em> way of acknowledging that you probably want to use Skells for this fight without actually showing the Skells in the cutscene, and has left a few people wondering just what's going on with Skells and cutscenes.</span></li><li> Chapter 10 damn near goes off the rails with it - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it seriously seems to be implying that you took on the Zu Pharg, AKA the robotic siege weapon the size of a large <em>building</em>, <em>on foot</em>. And <em>won</em>. In reality, you not only probably had everyone in Skells for that, but you very likely had flight modules!</span></li><li> It should be noted that the game regularly averts this outside of Skell-related issues.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries">Non-Mammal Mammaries</a>:<ul><li> Many alien women are not based on any sort of primate (or even mammalian) species and yet have human-shape breasts.

Liceors are similar, but have a more ethereal and bright design.</li><li> Gerrids look like an oversized flea with a nautilus's shell, except the shell is bright red or green, and the tentacles are more insectoid, and they have long, spindly legs.

Unlocking Meredith AM after completing chapter 4 will make Broken Skell Sidearms, Broken Skell Arm Weapons, and Broken Skell Spare Weapons disappear. 2. Wrothian Skells can drop their own unique brand of weapons which you can use on your own skell. However, there are only a finite number of times where you can encounter and fight them.

What it actually is is a range modifier that adds or subtracts from the base attack value of the weapon. Weapons with high stability (lower numbers) are desirable because their damage output is very consistent. However, Weapons with low stability (higher numbers) can inflict more damage but at the risk of inflicting very weak hits if you're unlucky. Stabilizer traits and augments allow a player to remain on the safe side of damage output whereas Destabilizer traits and augments offer a "high-risk, high-reward" fighting style to those that want to take their chances.</li><li> "Jarosch, the Sensational" is possibly the worst example of a Tyrant that you'll never find in your game unless you look up a guide. It becomes even more annoying if you're trying to collect it's Holofigure. Jarosch's spawn point is on a cluster of giant, red flowers growing on an arching tree in Rustpool Banks which will not activate unless you step directly inside it since it has a very short trigger distance.

You're constantly looking for wrecked Skells to be recovered, several missions involve gathering rare materials to fix them (or characters bemoaning the loss of their own Skell), and to even get one, you have to be deemed worthy by <em>every single branch of BLADE</em>, because Skell operators may need to be called upon by any branch.</li></ul></li><li> Your ability to investigate resources out in the field depends on which skills you've invested in (archaeology, mechanics, and biology) and your current level of expertise.</li><li> It also deals heavily with economics, as you'll need to invest in arms manufacturers and R&amp;D. Players can either use Miranium, or cash in CP<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6xlmi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6xlmi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6xlmi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">commercial points, which are earned by using a company's products to defeat Indigens</span> to acquire new gear. Or, you can opt to have them create specialized gear from rare items and materials you've gathered (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5GMD_-y6Iw">@7:08-7:25<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). You also can't throw credits at them, the manufacturers are working with a blank cheque already, it's their slice of the resource pie that CP affects.</li><li> Since Mira is an uncharted planet, one of BLADE's primary tasks is recon. Research probes study the indigenous wildlife to determine which ones are hostile and which areas are safe to explore. While data probes help them find resources that can be used to further support NLA.</li><li> You'll also need to account for weather, since your party (including their Skells) are effected by it. Heavy rain weakens beam weaponry, sandstorms and spore clouds impair visibility which decreases the accuracy of your attacks, and so on. Also, if you're caught in a electric storm, you'll continually take damage from it. But you can prevent it by taking shelter indoors, beneath arches, or in your Skells 'til it passes. Electromagnetic storms will damage your skell, but you're safe from volcanic rain inside one.</li><li> Monster levels don't really scale depending on where you are in the game. So players will see many enemies far out of their league as soon as they start. A lot of time in the beginning will be spent sneaking around to make sure you don't alert monsters that can mop the floor with you. You'll even see these kind of monsters directly in the path to your story objectives.</li><li> This untamed planet is not laid out in an adventurer-friendly way. A tall cliff face might require going greatly out of your way to find terrain gentle enough to climb, and stumbling off a ledge might as well have teleported you several sectors away.</li><li> Size matters. Like in real life, some creatures can be intimidated if you try to make yourself look larger. Many giant creatures like the whale-like Levitaths will leave you alone if you approach them on foot. You're too small to be perceived as a threat. That all changes in a Skell. Peaceful monsters will turn hostile because you're large enough to qualify as a threat now. Likewise, many smaller indigens like grexes will turn peaceful because they know not to mess with you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFootOfStomping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFootOfStomping">(unless you step on them by accident)</a>. Of course, there are plenty of indigens who attack regardless anyway.</li><li> Building relationships with all the numerous party members takes time, just like in real life. In order to do many affinity quests, you need to have at least two full hearts (sometimes three). This will require grinding a lot of Soul Voice combos in combat and it's best to have two characters other than Elma and Lin in your party while you make dialogue choices for side quests. Thankfully, due to the massive number of party members and the need to build affinity between them and the player character to unlock the quests that allow the player character to learn their exclusive Arts, a group of Support Quests exists for that very purpose and you can bring any party member from 0 to max affinity by playing the mission around 28 times.</li><li> Some Ganglion infantry Tyrants have their own personal Skell as a separate Tyrant in a different area from them. However, the Skells are only active at opposite times of day from their respective pilots on foot. After all, the pilot can't be in two places at once. The exceptions are Sharnaak's Seidr, which can be found anytime while its pilot only appears at night; Lyla's Galdr, which only appears at early morning while its pilot can be found anytime; and Luxaar's Xern, whose namesake owner is on the Ganglion command ship for most of the main story (the Xern, being a carrier vessel, most likely has its own commanding officer and a larger crew), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you don't fight Luxaar on foot at all and the Xern can still be fought even after Luxaar's death in the main story</span>.</li><li> If your Skell is equipped with a Sniper Rifle and one of it's arms is broken, it won't be able to fire anymore because the Sniper Rifle is a <em>two-handed weapon</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver">Red and Black and Evil All Over</a>:<ul><li> One chraracter effectively refers to Cauldros as "hell".

The most visible component of this system are randomized Squad Tasks that require you to collect specific types of items or kill specific types of enemies: doing so awards some Reward Tickets every time someone contributes towards a task to that person and a larger amount of them to every Squad member when one of them is completed. Completing said Tasks also contributes towards unlocking more online Squad missions.</li><li> Squad Missions are mini-excursions that can be undertaken with your party, or you can recruit other players to play alongside you(the game will usually tell you(the gold-bordered announcements) if a recruitment call goes out while you're playing, but not if you're in a menu). Completing these grants you a large amount of materials (sometimes from enemies that are otherwise only fought as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a>), more Reward Tickets and Battle Points. In additon, completing some missions in a certain way(examining suspicious objects, fighting extra enemiess the mission points out, or destroying the right part(s) of the mission's final enemy) can unlock another squad mission with even bigger rewards. All squad members also get reward tickets when somebody completes these, with final bonuses gained if all Squad Tasks and Squad Missions are completed.</li><li> Finally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> might appear at specific times for a limited amount of time: you have a preset amount of time to deplete as many of their lifebars as possible and if you reach specific milestones, you can get a number of rare items when either all of their lifebars are depleted or they escape at the end of their availability period. However, the real purpose of fighting them is destroying their appendages: each one drops 1-2 items when destroyed and you can get 7-14 of them per fight, which you can redeem for large amounts of Reward Tickets and is by far the quickest way to get a large number of them assuming you're strong enough to fight them long enough to dismember them without getting killed yourself, which isn't particularily hard to accomplish, then abandoning the mission. You don't get the normal rewards, but you <em>do</em> get to keep the parts you broke off.</li><li> Like stated above, you can hire other peoples' avatars to use as party members for a limited amount of time: killing enough enemies with them in your party increases their scout rank, which gives you some free items(you also get a free item when your avatar gets hired) and if it's maxed out, a BLADE Medal when you release them: this is one of the few ways to get them and you need them to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> mentioned above. Even if you don't want to hire another player's avatar, you can still ask them to provide Division Support, which nets you various buffs and bonuses in gameplay.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a>: Explicitly so.

A quick, glossed-over line in the opening cutscene mentions that humanity, despite being technologically outclassed by the aliens that attacked their planet, had "known the war was coming" and had prepared themselves for it. Despite Earth being their only home, humans were well-prepared for FTL velocity, space travel, as well as alien world colonization. The Skells they use are also fairly new to them, as they're the only species that hasn't figured out how to make theirs fly (at first). A Ma-non engineer comments mid-way through the game that there's a significant disparity between different areas of human technology: some of it is primitive, and some of it is surprisingly advanced. He assumes that humanity must have had a random super-genius come along and invent the advanced stuff.

The closest NLA has are Hope and Joy, who are not certified therapists in any sense&mdash;just very good at listening and giving advice, and recommending how playing sports (tennis in particular) is good for lowering stress, respectively. From a Watsonian (in-universe) perspective, this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> by saying no therapists were on the White Whale or survived the crash.
