One obstacle has proven to be insurmountable&mdash;the light barrier. Thus, each colonized planet has largely been left to its own devices; worlds develop at their own pace with limited contact between them. While small interstellar empires may occasionally form in highly-dense stellar regions such as star clusters or nearer to the galactic core, many of the isolated colonies bomb themselves back into the Stone Age, resulting in a wide technological gap. Some ascended to become super-advanced "transcendent worlds" that appear utterly alien, while others regressed to a pre-industrial state.</p><p>Your vessel was in orbit around one of these undeveloped planets before crashing in an unspecified accident. As none of you were enterprising colonists, your group is woefully unprepared for this primitive and potentially hostile world. Luckily, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod">Escape Pods</a> are well-stocked with basic tools, weapons, and supplies, giving means to provide for yourselves. Rescue is unlikely, as it'll probably be years before anyone even knows you're gone, but perhaps you can find some way to get yourself back home&mdash;provided you survive, of course. There are also options to play as the tribal descendants of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colony</a> who had survived from an attack from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">reactivated but malfunctioning robots</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldExplorer">Bold Explorer</a> who is on an adventure on a remote planet in search of fortune and glory. Or, you can make your own backstory.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The game's unique spin on the genre comes in the form of an "AI Storyteller" in addition to a standard set of difficulty levels&mdash;which allows the player to determine what sort of experience they want from their game: whether it be the more traditional progression of increasingly difficult challenges; a relaxed setting for base-building without the constant worry of having to defend against attackers; or a totally unpredictable sequence of events dictated by the whim of random chance.</p><p>An expansion, <em>Royalty</em>, was released on February 24, 2020.

Regardless of playstyle and technological level, the player will always be outnumbered and forced to rely on static defense to even the odds.</li><li> Pirates/Outlanders &mdash; Balanced/Generalist. Attack in moderate numbers and use mainly modern firearms. Some may use cruder firearms or melee weapons early on, though they progressively use stronger gear and employ a wider variety of strategies later on, such as besieging your colony with mortars or attacking with explosive weapons.</li><li> Tribals &mdash; Spammer. Tribals only use primitive weaponry like bows, spears and clubs, and body armor is rarely used. However, their sheer numbers still make them a considerable threat.</li><li> Mechanoids &mdash; Elitist. Mechanoids rarely attack in groupings of more than three but they feature thick metal armour and advanced weapons like charge lances and miniguns. Mechanoids come in four classes with distinct strengths and weaknesses.</li><li> Insects &mdash; Spammer/Brute. They spawn inside caves and mountains, often directly on top of constructed furniture or store rooms, and do so in huge numbers. They attack purely with melee, using both massive Megaspiders and much smaller worker drones. Their numbers will also steadily grow over time, and they will dig outward from their hives to expand their territory.</li><li> Empire (Royalty DLC) &#150;- Elitist. The Empire attacks in small numbers, but always come well equipped in mid to end game armor. Additionally, Imperial troopers are always skilled in either Shooting or Melee, making the Empire a formidable threat even in the endgame.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>:<ul><li> Some characters have backgrounds which prevent them from being able to use a weapon at all, even for hunting or in self-defense.</li><li> Subverted, however, in that there is nothing stopping a pacifist colonist from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">switching on your turrets or training their animals to attack enemies</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: The world your colonists land on was clearly once settled by an industrial civilization, before <em>something</em> happened, leaving nothing but a few ruined buildings, the remains of a highway network and the occasional "Ancient Danger".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth">Age Without Youth</a>: Colonists and animals can't die from old age alone. While increasing age comes with increased chances of all manner of illnesses and frailties, including heart attacks, the few that are potentially fatal can be treated by a doctor. With good enough medical care, and a survivable enough colony, your elderly colonists are effectively immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">but will probably be permanently bedridden</a>. Even replacing parts as they fall with cybernetic versions (especially the spine, since it's one of the first to go), eventually the colonist will get struck with both Alzheimer's and Dementia, both incurable barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Mech Serum</a> abuse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>: AI in the game is almost always portrayed as dangerously unpredictable or downright malevolent.<ul><li> Mechanoids are swarms of insectoid robots which are invariably hostile and seek only to destroy everything in their paths.</li><li> Zig-zagged by the AI Persona Cores. Building a spaceship with an AI Persona installed in it allows your colonists to leave the rim world behind, acting as a soft "ending" to the game. The core has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip">Morality Chip</a> installed by design to make it act in the crew's best interests, but where exactly it will take you is completely out of your hands. Other AI Personas that come with crashed spaceship parts tend to be much less friendly, from merely poisoning the land to outright psychically assaulting everyone around.</li><li> On the other hand, you can install said Persona Core into a colonist. Doing so dramatically increases their skill at intellectual tasks, at the cost of causing them to behave very erratically.</li><li> Also zig-zagged with Archotechs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">godlike AIs</a> who exist in the background of the setting. Most human civilisations cannot comprehend their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">far-reaching, complex goals</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">complicated morals and motives</a>. An archotech may choose to send a ship that comes into its system on its way without any trouble and no memory of the encounter, cure diseases or degenerative conditions of the crew or simply make them disappear altogether. One can never tell.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: Some characters have traits like "Chemical interest" and "Chemical fascination," making them more prone to drug addiction. Complete withdrawal is possible, but it's a lengthy process that requires micromanagement and which renders the addict less efficient and much more prone to mental breaks for the duration. Characters with interest/fascination traits will also ignore drug policies and frequently go on uncontrolled binges, so the only way to keep those characters clean is to either wall off the drug stash or keep a drug-free environment at all times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">Alcohol-Induced Idiocy</a>: Characters who have gone on a drinking binge will ignore all other responsibilities they have, ignore your attempts to forbid them from drinking more beer, and vomit in inconvenient places (which ruins the room's attractiveness until it's cleaned up).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimalsAreDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimalsAreDogs">All Animals Are Dogs</a>: Downplayed. Most animals can be tamed, but only dogs and a few other particularly intelligent animals can be trained to do certain tasks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDesertsHaveCacti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDesertsHaveCacti">All Deserts Have Cacti</a>: They replace trees as the default source of wood in Deserts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter">Alliance Meter</a>: NPC factions can have varying relationship values with your colony which can improve or worsen depending on actions taken like imprisoning their members or giving them gifts of silver. Those listed as "hostile" will attack you on sight, while those whom you have good enough relations with can be called on for help if you need it (on rare occasions they'll come of their own accord).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPlanetsAreEarthlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPlanetsAreEarthlike">All Planets Are Earthlike</a>: Justified. All habitable planets were terraformed and seeded with genetically-modified plant and animal life, so all flora and fauna present are recognizably derived from Earth life (if often somewhat altered). Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">crash-landing on an airless rock would make the game very short indeed</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: The game has a fiction primer (a Google Doc accessible from the game's main menu) that has further detail about the setting regarding what types of planets there are and what kinds of technology exist from planet to planet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: Some factions just can't be reasoned or negotiated with; their opinion of you and everyone else on the planet is perpetually stuck at -100 no matter what you do. These include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>, insect hives, and mechanoids.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmmunitionConservation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmmunitionConservation">Ammunition Conservation</a>: With the Careful Shooter trait, a character is careful not to waste ammunition, and lines up every shot before firing. Despite a penalty to the fire rate, the character more than makes up for it in accuracy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>: Limbs can be damaged, shot off or destroyed in the course of normal combat, and they can also be amputated to be replaced with prosthetics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>:<ul><li> In general, most projectile weapons do little damage per hit and enemy forces can pelt each other with slugs for awhile until blood loss and combined pain threshold finally takes someone out of the fight. On the other hand, there's always the chance a projectile could strike something vital and cripple or kill the target instantly. Additionally, any bleeding wound carries the chance of an infection if improperly treated, which is <em>far</em> more serious.</li><li> Averted with the introduction of ranged damage increasing with weapon quality. Because recurve bows and greatbows are very quick and cheap to make compared to guns you can make a lot more of them and have a better chance at getting higher-quality ones, which means they will outdamage most early guns handily and can take enemies (or colonists if you're on the wrong end of a tribal raid) down in short order.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa">Angst Coma</a>: One of the extreme mental breaks causes catatonia to your colonist. They will need a long time to recover from it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor">Anti-Armor</a>: Uranium slug turret. It has very high armour penetration and causes a lot of damage, so is very good for killing mechanoids and pirates with powered armour.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: There are a few, especially when compared to the obtuse complexity of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em><ul><li> Your colonists never have to worry about seeds or irrigation when growing crops.</li><li> Steel never needs smelting from base ores to create&mdash;though this is partially justified by all the metal you mine being ruins from a preexisting civilization. Likewise, Gold and Silver are instantly turned into workable currency upon mining.</li><li> Cotton plants and animal wool immediately create cloth when harvested. The butchering process automatically converts animal skin into leather.</li><li> Ammunition, for personal weapons at least, isn't a thing: have ranged weapon, can shoot all day.</li><li> Medical supplies can be used to treat all illnesses and injuries equally.</li><li> Your colonists never have to worry about drinking regularly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">nor do they have to concern themselves with sewage handling and treatment</a>.</li><li> Roofs can be built for free almost anywhere.</li><li> Tools for mining, tilling the soil, chopping down trees, building structures and assembling electronics aren't represented.</li><li> Enemy attacks at each difficulty will scale directly to your colony's wealth statistic, which is a measure of the value of all materials, colonists, and other things in your colony. This way, your colony won't be facing hordes of invaders or a slew of devastating events until it is theoretically able to handle those threats. Unless you're playing with Randy - in that case, all bets are off.</li><li> Both Cassandra and Phoebe have a grace period of a couple days after a raid to allow your colony to treat your wounded and recover from losses without risk of another raid.

More impactful (literally) than that bit of fluff is the Antigrain Warhead, an extremely rare and extremely powerful mortar shell that can wipe out entire raiding parties in a single shot. It's a weapon normally used by space warships against other space warships, and you can use it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">to blast cavemen armed with spears and bows to smithereens</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchaicWeaponForAnAdvancedAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchaicWeaponForAnAdvancedAge">Archaic Weapon for an Advanced Age</a>: You can find advanced things like killer robots or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon">Charged-shot weapons</a>, but your best early-to-midgame melee weapons are still longswords or spears.

Most weapons have penetration of at least 15%, meaning they punch clean through a 15% armor rating, and late-game charge guns can reach up to 90% penetration. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> is usually the only real option you have for reliably retaining at least some protection from even the most powerful weapons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>: "Mechanoid" enemies are sentient robots and come in four flavors:<ul><li> Centipedes which are big, slow, and hard to kill: they carry powerful, fast-firing ranged weaponry that can shred static defenses and massed soldiers, but are relegated to weak ramming attacks if you can get them in melee.</li><li> Scythers are smaller, faster, and more fragile, and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeBelowTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeBelowTheShoulder">hand blades</a> that will rip apart a colonist at close range &mdash; if they can get in.</li><li> Lancers are also fast and delicate, carrying "charge lances", that fire slowly but have great range and hurt a <em>lot</em> when they hit.

Including walking through raging wildfires, running into traps in plain sight, or even releasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">ancient dangers</a>. The raider AI has improved over time to make it less exploitable, and after the 1.0 update they will often avoid obvious killboxes and try to break in along other, more vulnerable approaches.</li><li> Related, but Sapper AI is notoriously stupid, in that more often than not they try to tunnel through the wrong walls, be it the ruins of ancient structures or even opening up an Ancient Danger and getting themselves slaughtered by the insects or mechanoids within. This also makes them easy to bait through pointless walls.</li><li> Neither raiders nor your own colonists who are armed with explosive weapons will check minimum distance before firing. They have absolutely no qualms with hurling grenades, tossing molotovs, firing incendiary cannons, or shooting Doomsday rockets into friendlies or even shooting them at point-blank range to kill a melee attacker. The latter often ends up killing themselves and multiple friendlies in the process.</li><li> Likewise, your own colonists have only a marginal sense of self preservation and see absolutely nothing wrong with running out into a firefight to tame a muffalo or pick up some random supplies in the middle of an enemy attack. They are also prone to suddenly wanting to go outside to watch clouds or take walks the instant a manhunter pack or raid shows up, and because of how the game handles recreation it can be very hard to get them to stay inside.</li><li> If a colonist's recreation need is low and their work schedule allows them to fill it, they will prioritize recreation over <em>anything else.</em> Blight will devour your crops, patients will bleed to death, and fires will rage out of control because your colonists are too busy playing horseshoes. The only way to bypass this is to draft the colonist and then undraft them, as this "resets" their behaviors, or select the colonist and force them to do the essential task by right-clicking on the thing that needs doing.</li><li> Colonists and pets only consider areas off-limits when calculating their starting point and their destination, not necessarily the path they take to get there. This means they are prone to taking 'shortcuts' through areas you've forbidden them from going into, which can sometimes lead to them getting shot by raiders, poisoned by toxic fallout, or worse, letting a whole pack of manhunters in through a door they opened that you forgot to forbid.</li><li> Faction caravans and visitors have an uncanny ability to leave your colony just in time to walk right into the crossfire of an ongoing raid. The usual result is another hostile faction on your list because all those stupid deaths get blamed on you. Unfortunately, there's no way to ask visitors to extend their stay for another day or so to prevent disasters like these.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeology">Artistic License &#150; Geology</a>: Steel and Compacted Machinery can be mined from stone.

By contrast, wooden floors were <em>not</em> flammable until Alpha 17, which led to bizarre early building designs where wooden floors were being used to prevent the steel walls from catching fire.</li><li> One of the rarest and strongest construction materials is uranium, a highly radioactive metal. However, radiation simply doesn't exist in the game, so you can craft your colonists houses, beds, weapons and armor made of uranium without anyone suffering from radiation poisoning. Not to mention that uranium is an extremely dense element (about 2.5 times the density of iron), making it rather impractical for most applications aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">crafting it into maces</a>.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Weirdly</a>, one of the bionic implants introduced by the <em>Royalty</em> DLC is a nuclear-powered stomach that <em>does</em> increase the pawn's risk of developing carcinomas.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: Lavish meals, at least in the early to mid game.

Sure, the Assault Rifle shoots faster, the Sniper Rifle can reach across half the map, and the Charge Rifle deals more damage, but the Bolt Action Rifle deals good damage, out to goodly range, and is 'cheap' enough to stockpile several up to counteract the relatively-slow rate of fire. You even start with one in one starting scenario.</li><li> The Recurve Bow deals damage comparable to the Revolver at all but the very closest of ranges, but it can out-range all of the guns except for the precision rifles and the rocket launchers. It is effective even in the hands of only moderately-skilled shooters, and extremely easy to make&mdash;it only needs wood and it doesn't even require a smithy to build, a crafting spot will do. In addition, it leads to the Greatbow, a ranged option that completely outclasses any other non-firearm and can even compete with the Bolt-Action Rifle! In the Lost Tribes scenario it is recommended you make the upgraded bows your first research choice so you can fight with gun-toting raiders on equal footing.</li><li> Alpacas, muffalos and dromedaries are by far some of if not <em>the</em> best animal species to tame and use as livestock. Alpacas provide valuable wool for clothing production at a fast rate (100 wool per 15 days, or 6.67 per day) and have a low handling threshold that lets almost any colony tame them; muffalos provide some of the best cold-resistant wool in the game at a rate of 100 wool per 25 days (or 4 per day) and produce a <em>lot</em> of meat when butchered; dromedaries provide milk, which can be a vital component of meals in the hotter climates of the game where they're found in large herds, and also produce a lot of meat when butchered. All three also count as pack animals, raising the carrying capacity of any caravan they're attached to, making them invaluable for trading with other factions or mining clumps of rare resources found around the world map. Prior to Patch 1.1 muffalos and dromedaries were even better, being the only tamable animals in the game that provided meat, milk, fur and carrying capacity for caravans, before they were quietly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> (muffalos lost their milk while dromedaries lost their fur) seemingly to make room for the yak as the new all-rounder animal.</li><li> For pack animals, nothing matches horses for efficiency. They need less food than most pack animals, and are the fastest by far. They also carry more than you would expect for their size. Fitting since that holds true in real life too, and was one of the primary methods of transporting goods and letters before personal vehicles.</li><li> For melee weapons, the gladius is a jack-of-all-stats deal: more damage than the knife, faster than the longsword, and cheap enough to be a good choice in most situations. Maces can also be quite useful, as many armors, even powered armor, protect less effectively against blunt damage.</li><li> For battle animals, boars are king. They are omnivores, so feeding them is as easy as zoning them to grass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedToPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedToPigs">or the corpse freezer</a>, they are faster than humans, hit harder than most animals, breed fairly fast and are easy to tame and maintain. It is telling that they are one of the few prey animals able to inflict lethal wounds on wargs in the wild (the other being tortoises).</li><li> Really hard to go wrong with Healroot for most situations. Minor disease, healroot. Bruises and cuts, healroot. Need an anesthetic, healroot. Moderately easy to grow and one of the few plants that a cold snap will not instantly destroy.</li><li> Penoxycyline provides immunity every 5 days to the dreaded malaria and plague (though it cannot stop a disease in progress, only prevent it), and can be crafted with neutroamine, acquired from traders. The drug can prove incredibly useful, especially in biomes such as the Tropical Rainforest or Tropical Swamp where disease outbreaks are common.</li><li> Cloth is one of the potential lifebloods of any colony. It's relatively easy to stockpile since it grows from the cotton plant, it's a necessary component of the poker table and billiards table that expand on your range of recreational activities, it's the main way to produce armchairs and bedrolls, the most comfy chairs in the game and an in-between for sleeping spots and proper beds that allows your colonists to sleep comfortably when on caravans, the baseline component of clothes spun from leathers and fabrics... the list goes on. It's especially good to invest in cloth after researching carpet making, since cloth is the only way to lay down carpets that really beautify any room they're attached to.</li><li> Nutrient paste dispensers. Straight from the machine's description, it consumes less time and energy to produce meals than traditional cooking and it accepts almost any ingredient. Nutrient paste never confers the risk of food poisoning and does not require a trained cook to prepare, as the machine makes them automatically - place the ingredients in the hoppers and away you go. Your colonists won't be thrilled by the nasty green slop, but the mood penalty is still less than if they ate the raw ingredients, and in a desolate environment where food is scarce, this machine can save lives. And if nothing else, nutrient paste makes for great low-cost animal fodder.</li><li> The "Killbox" and "Roof Trap" strategies for base defense. A Killbox usually consists of a wide-open area filled with traps, firing points and turrets which enemies can be funneled into through a single tight passage and then destroyed easily by overwhelming firepower coming from multiple angles. A Roof Trap is effectively a giant single-use deadfall trap consisting of a single wooden pillar supporting a roof; when enemies stray under it, the pillar can be destroyed with concentrated gunfire or an IED, collapsing the roof and injuring all of them in one go. Good use of these two traps can easily neutralize the threat of most invasions, and some players refuse to use them because they take out a lot of the fun and challenge of the game.<ul><li> In more recent updates, however, raids can now spawn with sappers, who can bypass your colony's defenses by mining into weak points in your base. Raiders can also now spawn with explosive weapons such as the rocket launcher, which can be devastating to the crowded defenses within a killbox. These make killboxes less effective than they were before, though it is still a popular structure for defense.</li></ul></li><li> Bunkers. Build a room from stone walls in any shape (or re-purpose a ruin) with some single-tile shooting holes to be filled with sandbags, and finish with a roof and concrete or stone flooring. Voila, you now have a defensive structure that gives your shooters full protection from gunfire from every angle (thanks to the cover calculations from the walls), protection from rain (so no accuracy malus when firing) and lightning strikes and even some protection from thrown explosives as long as the grenade landed outside the wall. Bunkers are cheap, easy to build, easy to upgrade and effective at all stages of the game. The only danger is that melee enemies with shields can get close enough to climb the sandbags and assault you at point-blank range.</li><li> Always scoop up the gear dropped by defeated raiders even if you don't need it for your colonists. There's no easier and cheaper way to improve your standing with other factions than gifting all the useless junk in your armory to them. Bonus points if it was their own raiding party that dropped the stuff in the first place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>: <em>Royalty</em> offers an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example. If you manage to get at least one of your pawns elevated to the noble rank of Count(ess), the local High Stellarch of the empire you're subservient to offers your colonists a place on his ship if you host him for about two weeks. This is an alternate path to victory to building your own spaceship to escape the planet. Normally, attaining the Count(ess) rank requires completing quite a bit of work for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, but you can also just pay the royal tribute collector a tithe in gold or slaves to increase your rank when he stops by your colony twice a year. It's an expensive approach for sure, but it tends to be a lot faster and safer than endless questing, let alone scraping together the rare resources required to build a ship on your own. And let's not forget about the numerous powerful psykers you can groom this way fairly quickly, provided you have the funds.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>: Characters with the Abrasive trait speak their mind and don't care what others think.

Brain damage both affects their ability to do anything and is impossible to heal without Luciferium or the extremely rare Healer mech serum. They may also suffer injuries to the spine or legs, which immobilize them almost permanently, at least until you either acquire them a bionic replacement, feed them a steady supply of Luciferium (which slowly regenerates damaged body parts, albeit at the price of permanently addicting them), or use a Healer mech serum on them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>: Because all humans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">procedurally generated</a>, they end up with not only very distinct personalities and behavior patterns, but with enough variation in body type and skin tone to be fairly distinct visually as well.

Prime examples include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">space battles in orbit</a>, malevolent AI <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">mind-raping</a> your colonists from beyond your reach until they go insane, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolarFlareDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolarFlareDisaster">solar flares</a> shutting down your power network, or a volcanic winter making agriculture impossible for years on end.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPet">Cool Pet</a>: Pretty much any animal in the game can be tamed if a colonist is good enough at it, which means you can have a plethora of uncommon animals as pets, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible">friendly genetically engineered killer dogs</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">massive fluffy megasloths</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Creator Cameo</a>: Tynan Sylvester (A lead developer of the game) may appear in the game if you were really lucky. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">his stats are very low, and he always has the "Slothful" trait</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">This makes him a very useless character.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>: Some pawns are geared so tightly to one job that putting them to work elsewhere is somewhere between foolish and detrimental to the colony. That said, what they can do, they do <em>really</em> well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">Cybernetics Eat Your Soul</a>: Played around with.<ul><li> Played straight by characters with the Body Purist trait. They get ever-mounting mood penalties for having any of their body parts replaced with bionic ones, up to -35 at six parts, and have lowered opinions of other colonists with bionics.</li><li> Inverted by characters with the Transhumanist trait. They feel limited by their flesh and want to be bionic. As such, they get ever-mounting mood <em>boosts</em> for having any of their body parts replaced with bionic ones, and have <em>increased</em> opinions of other colonists with bionics.</li><li> Luciferium is a drug that permanently turns a colonist into a host for nanotech drones that render them immune to disease, enhances their minds and bodies, regenerates any body part (even brain damage!), <em>and</em> makes them move at superhuman speed... at the cost of being forever addicted to it and going berserk and dying if they ever get off their fix.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>: Your colonists can replace some of their limbs and organs with bionic equivalents that upgrade their performance with that body part significantly. This can be especially useful for dealing with aging colonists who become more and more likely to develop issues with their sight, hearing and motor functions. It's also a great way to keep pawns with the Transhumanist trait happy since they gain escalating mood boosts for every implant they have installed, up to +13 at five parts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">Cycle of Hurting</a>: Used as a balance element. A pawn who is in a melee and tries to run away will be slowed to a crawl every time the melee pawn attacks them. Fortunately (or not, depending which pawn is yours) this means a ranged pawn who gets stuck in a melee is trapped in one of these, as they move away only to get slowed down with each attack, letting the melee pawn catch up and make another attack, slowing them down again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a>: Although nothing in the game actually forbids you from using it, the Neuroquake psycast should be treated as such. It mind-rapes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the entire planet</a></em> so hard that every living thing on the map outside a small area around the caster goes violently insane, plus it instantly incurs serious reputation drops with every faction on the world map. It also takes a long time to cast and makes the caster fall into a multi-day coma<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0a7br');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0a7br" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0a7br');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although it has been found that correct preparation can reduce this time to a couple of hours</span> after the fact. Extremely powerful without a doubt, but only to be used under the direst of circumstances (unless you're so well established that you can use it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">For the Lulz</a> without having to worry much about the fallout).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>: Not literally, but invoked by name with Luciferium. It's actually a nanite pill that provides significant health benefits (including the ability to repair brain damage, regenerate lost limbs, and reverse the effects of aging), but at the cost of giving the patient and incurable addiction with potentially lethal withdrawal symptoms... and you can't make any yourself, so you're limited to whatever stockpiles you can scavenge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a>:<ul><li> Mechanoids and (rarely) pirate raids can arrive via drop-pods and will often smash through your ceiling, or at the very least circumvent your carefully placed defenses by arriving in the middle of your garden. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> is also quite fond of doing this due to their high tech level.</li><li> All factions including the player can make use of mortars to rain devastation on the enemy from across the map.</li><li> Probably the worst example is the Space Battle event during which two fleets of warships clash in orbit over your colony, resulting in a rain of ship chunks pummeling a large part of the map with extremely damaging impacts. This event can drag on for <em>days</em> and might well be centered smack-dab on your base if you're particularly unlucky, and there's absolutely no way to do anything about it other than clear the area ASAP. The only good thing to say about it is that the mass arrival of ship chunks and survivors in escape pods can give your colony a serious boost in resources and manpower if you play your cards right.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a>: Critters like rats or squirrels deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> at best, but their tiny size makes them very hard to hit even with crowd control weaponry, and the numerous bites and scratches accumulate pain and blood loss quickly. Encountering a pack of manhunting squirrels, as hilarious as it may sound, can be more dangerous than a pride of rampaging lions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>: The planet your colonists crash-land on is inevitably chock-full of hostile tribes, aggressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirates</a>, and wildlife that has an occasional tendency to go berserk. In extreme climates, you may also have to contend with a lack of conveniently arable land and the local weather: Extreme Deserts are scorching hot and largely devoid of life, but there are some patches of gravel where you can maybe grow small potato crops; Sea Ice, places where it's so cold that the sea has frozen over, have almost no wildlife and no arable land whatsoever &mdash; all food must come from Muffalo herding, trade or cannibalism until hydroponics and moisture pumps can make greenhouses possible. And if all the above don't get you, there's solar flares randomly shutting down your power network, super-volcano eruptions darkening the sky, toxic fallout poisoning all life on the map, psychic rain letting your colonists age at a massively increased rate, and malevolent AI mind-raping your colonists or simply sending hordes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robots</a> after you just because. All things considered, it's borderline miraculous your rimworld is as densely populated as it is. By rights, everyone should've been long dead by the time you arrive.<ul><li> And if that's <em>still</em> not nasty enough for you, there's mods aplenty that add even more unpleasant ways for a colony to fail horribly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt">Decadent Court</a>: The Empire's various royals act like this, and can turn your own colonists into such with the appropriate royal titles. While the nobles themselves are useless in day to day affairs, and typically can make unreasonable demands for lavish throne rooms and meals, their titles give them access to Imperial troops and gifts of psionic powers that can save your colony from an impossible situation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship">Defeat Equals Friendship</a>:<ul><li> If your survivors take prisoners from an attack on the colony, they can be recruited into the community. Starting with the Alpha 8 series of updates, you can also release prisoners for goodwill points with the factions they belong to, applying the trope on a larger scale.</li><li> The same can be done with rampaging animals - beat them down, patch them up afterwards, and chances are good you'll have some new tamed animals for your colony.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a>: The Shield belt can protect the wearer from incoming projectiles, but they will not be able to use firearms because the shield also blocks bullets from inside.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron">Dented Iron</a>: Physical damage taken by your colonists will linger if not properly treated, and in some cases only high-level surgeries can fix the damage. Have an eye gouged out by an angry bear? Enjoy reduced vision and a nasty scar until you can install a bionic replacement. Get shot in the spine? You're now an invalid until a bionic spine can be sourced to replace your ruined backbone. Lose an organ? Better hope it's one you can live without, unless you're rich enough to buy a replacement, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">ruthless enough</a> to harvest organs from captured enemies. Aging colonists have it worst of all, though, because on top of loss of sight, hearing and motor functions, they also have to deal with mental conditions like dementia that you <em>can't</em> use bionics to bypass.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">Deus Est Machina</a>: "Transcendent" worlds are planets where unrestricted archotech AI development has lead to the creation of unfathomable machine intelligences that create technologies like Dyson spheres, convert entire worlds into computing machines, unlimited power generation, and psychic technologies. Bits and pieces of these godly AI inventions show up as phenomenally dangerous artifacts or ship components that threaten your colony.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigAttack">Dig Attack</a>: Sappers are capable of digging through mountains, just like your miners. They'll also try to breach your defensive walls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie">Die, Chair, Die!</a>: Some mental breaks have a colonist take their pent up feelings out on a structure or piece of furniture. Some raiders will focus on targeting specific usable items that they can easily reach, like furniture and power generators, if they're outside your base's perimeter. This can prove detrimental in rare occasions, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">colonist destroying a mortar or turret, causing it to explode and kill themselves</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>: Your first quest with Royalty installed will almost always be to "rescue" a noble who is being menaced by a terrible threat. Said terrible threat is a single small, nonthreatening animal. The quest name will lampshade this with a derogatory term for the hapless noble you are rescuing from a furious rabbit or squirrel, such as "The Wimpy Duke."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntLikeGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntLikeGuns">Doesn't Like Guns</a>: Characters with the "Brawler" trait are more skilled at and deadly in melee combat, but will suffer mood penalties if forced to carry ranged weapons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">Does Not Like Men</a>: Colonists with the "Misandrist" trait dislike and distrust men. Male colonists with the said trait do exist, but they are much rarer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">Drop the Hammer</a>:<ul><li> The <em>Royalty</em>-exclusive Zeushammer is a massively powerful melee weapon that inflicts both physical and EMP damage, making it eminently suited for fighting mechanoids and shielded opponents. Acquiring it can be tricky, though.</li><li> Some of the most popular mods expand the base game's weapon roster with numerous medieval weapons and modern-day tools, including (war) hammers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Druid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Druid">Druid</a>: There exists on every single map a unique tree called an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">Anima tree</a>. Having people meditate near it causes Anima Grass to grow around its base, and once enough grass has grown its possible to have a pawn link with it and gain the ability to casts Psycasts. It helps that the description of it read like a shoutout to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a>: Hunting wildlife for food and leather is a great way to keep your colony stocked up. However, most animals have a small chance of becoming "manhunters" when injured, especially at close range, and running down the attacker without mercy. Worse, if there's a pack of that animal nearby, they may <em>all</em> become enraged simultaneously.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a>: Leaving human corpses lying around (either unburied or not tossed into an incinerator) produces negative thoughts, especially if they're of former fellow survivors. Giving them a proper burial will help remove negative thoughts, and placing them in a crafted sarcophagi will actually increase their recreation value, indirectly improving mood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep">Dug Too Deep</a>: Mining or drilling for resources can sometimes release a swarm of giant insects. The event is even called "Too deep!" in the alert message.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarAche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarAche">Ear Ache</a>: It's possible to lose ears in battle. Without ears, colonists can't do social-based work well, like recruiting prisoners or trading items with traders. The only way to fix this is to install bionic ears as replacements.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>: A "planetkiller" may impact the world you're on, vaporizing it with the force of "a trillion hydrogen bombs" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">ending the game instantly</a> as, obviously, you do not survive.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elaborate Underground Base</a>: You can go for one of these if the map you choose has sufficient mountainous terrain. Slower to construct since digging takes time, but the mountain can help your colony withstand mortars and force attacking enemies to run into your only entrance to get slaughtered in your kill zone (unless they brought sappers).<ul><li> However, tunneling increases the chance of burrowing insects appearing and making nests in your halls. They will attack colonists and chew through walls, but they also produce valuable, nutritious, and tasty insect jelly, so it's possible to farm them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">EMP</a>: EMP grenades can be used to temporarily disable turrets, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Mechanoids</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a>. The <em>Royalty</em>-exclusive Zeushammer melee weapon has the same effect as its unique feature, with the added benefit of dealing tremendous damage on top of the EMP.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a>: Persona weapons have a sentient AI bound into them that can have various effects both beneficial or detrimental. Many persona weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">constantly talk to their wielder</a>, with friendly AI lifting their mood and mad ones making them unhappy.

A large number of their possible traits turns them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Amplifier Artifacts</a> in the hands of psychic pawns, which in combination with their ludicrous damage ratings makes them extremely valuable gear, even more so in light of most psycasts' rather short range forcing your psykers to get close to the enemy, anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedArchaicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedArchaicWeapon">Enhanced Archaic Weapon</a>: Royalty DLC introduces melee weapons that use very advanced technologies, like Plasmaswords and electrical Zeushammers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter">Endless Winter</a>: One possible random event is a massive eruption that triggers a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter">volcanic winter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which can last for <em>years</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">The Engineer</a>: Raider groups may include sappers, who will try to bypass your defensive strongpoints by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">blowing up walls or tunneling through mountains</a> to clear a path for their comrades.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithLlamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithLlamas">Everything's Better with Llamas</a>: The game features alpacas. Wild ones are peaceful and can be hunted for their meat or tamed. Tamed alpacas produce wool, one of the many materials you can craft clothes with. Also, alpacas can be added to a caravan, raising the maximum weight cap of what you can take to trade with neighbour settlements.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">Explosive Breeder</a>: Really, any animal can be this if you are not careful, but the prize goes to Chickens, who if you are not careful will breed hundreds of chicks and kill your framerate and food reserves in a matter of weeks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedToTheElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedToTheElements">Exposed to the Elements</a>: Done somewhat realistically. Most outfits have insulation values that help characters resist extreme heat or cold better. Depending on the climate, wearing the right clothing can make the difference between feeling a little chilly and dying in the snow from hypothermia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a>: Eyes can be damaged or destroyed, impairing a character's perception. The only way to correct this is to install bionic or archotech eyes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a>: The game has plenty of drugs, but none of them are real, except beer. However, some drugs are rather similar to real life drugs.<ul><li> Smokeleaf joints are very similar to marijuana joints. It makes people happy and hungry and slow, and it's green.</li><li> Yayo is similar to cocaine, and the name might sound familiar if you watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface">Scarface</a></em>. People use it by snorting it, and it can make people <em>really</em> happy, and suppress pain. As yayo is to cocaine, flake is to crack. It comes from the same plant as yayo, but requires less refinement, is smoked in a pipe instead of snorted, and has more debilitating side effects.</li><li> Wake-Up, a highly addictive stimulant which greatly increases move speed and removes the need to rest, is essentially meth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedToPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedToPigs">Fed to Pigs</a>: Pigs and other non-herbivorous animals will eat human corpses as long as they are not rotting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">Feel No Pain</a>: The Painstopper implant causes a pawn to cease to feel any pain. This makes them much more dangerous in combat, as while they are still as fragile as before, they can't be slowed or stopped by simple physical shock, only critical damage will impede them. As well, and lingering pain from old injuries will be removed. However, pawns with the Masochist trait who receive this will find that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness">they can no longer derive joy from their pain either</a>.<ul><li> Inverted with colonists with the "Wimp" trait.

Knights wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and wielding plasmaswords? Check. Stratified society built on honor and obedience? Fleets of void warships? Space megastructures? Check, check and check.

You bet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">Fingore</a>: Individual fingers and toes can be damaged or lost by injuries, though it's usually less of an inconvenience than losing a full limb.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a>: Colonists who have their mood lower too much will eventually suffer a breakdown. This can range from relatively harmless (hiding in their room) to outright disturbing (digging up a corpse and dumping it somewhere everyone else will see it) or worse, verbal and physical violence (going on insult sprees that may well make the other character snap out of their own lowered mood or random acts of violence against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">anyone</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie">anything</a> in sight).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">Friendly Fireproof</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Nope</a>.

This can also be true if they're a Misogynist in an otherwise all-female colony or a Misandrist in an otherwise all-male colony. Interestingly, these aren't bad to have around - Because nobody likes them the whole colony gets a mood boost if they just happen to die, so making them fistfight a bear or attack a raid by themselves is a quick way to get a mood boost.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureFoodIsArtificial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureFoodIsArtificial">Future Food Is Artificial</a>: Not all of it is, but you can build Nutrient Paste Dispensers that render raw foodstuffs into, well, nutrient paste.

One of the running jokes within the fandom is to dub useless colonists or prisoners "hats." In fairness, most colonists who <em>aren't</em> Cannibals or Psychopaths get a mood debuff from wearing clothing of human leather.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects">Geo Effects</a>: Terrain is an important gameplay element. The local climate determines what sort of crops you can grow and how well they'll flourish. As of Alpha 8, temperature is modeled in the game as well; leave your colonists in extreme temperatures for too long, and they may succumb to heatstroke or hypothermia.<ul><li> The most comfortable environment for your colonists is the Temperate Forest, a deciduous forest with fertile soil and diverse animal life big and small, as well as cool winters and mild, pleasant summers.</li><li> Arid Shrubland and Boreal Forest are the next most desirable: Arid Shrubland is an open plain of dry grass and bushes with the occasional grove, populated by hardy plants and animals accustomed to the heat which persists throughout the year; Boreal Forest is a coniferous forest with freezing winters and cool summers, with limited potential for farming but diverse wildlife ripe for hunting.</li><li> Tropical Rainforest is more challenging. Intense heat, choking overgrowth, thick mud, aggressive wildlife including deadly snakes and large predators, and conducive conditions for disease all combine for a "Green Hell" that will put survivors wits and nerve to the test.</li><li> Swamp biomes (Temperate Swamp, Cold Bog and Tropical Swamp) combine all the traits of Temperate Forest, Boreal Forest and Tropical Rainforest with increased disease chance and limited space for building.</li><li> Desert and Tundra provide real challenge for your colonists. Deserts are very hot and very dry areas that support little life; only hardy potato crops can grow in the small patches of gravelly soil, and animals for hunting are few and far between, however moisture pumps could be used to prepare soft sandy soil for farming other crops. Tundra presents frozen plains with no trees and little vegetation, very short or non-existent growing seasons made up for by large herds of migratory grazing megafauna and the predators that hunt them.</li><li> Extreme Desert and Ice Sheet are the hardest areas to live. Extreme Desert is an extremely hot and dry area devoid of life, with limited prospects for survival without hydroponics farming. Ice Sheet is a layer of kilometre-thick permafrost with no soil for farming in most places, and any animal found here will be either migrating or badly lost; hunting, trade and cannibalism will be the main source of food here, but at least geothermal vents can be used for free heating. The silver lining of these two biomes is that any raiders foolish enough to attack your colony will likely die from heatstroke or hypothermia quickly.</li><li> Sea Ice is permanent ice sheet where the cold has caused the sea itself to freeze over. There is no soil, no animals to hunt and no minerals to mine. Sea Ice is technically not intended for building a colony, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

However, which pawns get elevated to nobility is solely the player's choice, so if you created yourself a conceited noble, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">it's your own damn fault</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">Love Hurts</a>: Being in a healthy relationship can significantly improve the mood of colonists, but a relationship ending, either becouse one of them dies or because of a divorce, induces a rather big mood penalty that lasts for a long time. Also, failure to establish a relationship can lead to small but repeated mood penalties that can leave your colonist at the edge of breaking for a long time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech">Low Culture, High Tech</a>: Played with.<ul><li> On the one hand, since your own tech level is no hindrance to using items far more advanced than you can make yourselves, if you get hold of them by scavenging or trading. On the other hand, the same applies to high-tech factions using low-tech products. For example, a space-faring colony can drink all the beer they want, but if they want to brew it themselves, they'll need to research how, and they'll even find the research harder than a tribal colony would.</li><li> Averted in the strictest sense of the term "culture." Every band of survivors has access to the Sculptor's Workbench, and thus the capacity to create works of art, from the very beginning. The ability of a colony to produce "culture" in the form of art has less to do with its abstract tech level than it does with its ability to adequately provide basic needs (such as food, shelter, and security) with enough abundance that they can afford to have members spend their time doing things other than desperately foraging for tomorrow's meal.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">Made of Explodium</a>:<ul><li> The aptly named boomrats and boomalopes explode when killed. They can be a good source of fuel if domesticated, but for heaven's sake, <em>don't keep them all together in a wooden barn</em>.</li><li> Mortar shells, unsurprisingly. If their item hitpoints reach zero for whatever reason (deterioration due to storage outside a building, or because someone shot at them, or because a fire broke out nearby), they'll explode with their appropriate effects. This scales with the shells' stack size, meaning a full stack of 25 high-ex shells going off in your base is something you want to avoid at almost any cost.</li><li> 'Royalty' introduces Unstable Power Cells, lesser versions of the Vanometric power cell that provide a significant amount of infinite energy, but blow up with enough force to disintegrate a Centipede if something so much as sneezes at it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">Made a Slave</a>: Pirate trading ships travel the stars, and you can buy fresh colonists from them or, at the cost of a little morale, sell them your prisoners.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>:<ul><li> Colonists can survive getting riddled with bullets, having limbs blown off, and even getting heart-shot. Can cross over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron">Dented Iron</a>, as wounds don't always heal properly if they're poorly treated, which usually impairs their function slightly and subjects the character to constant (though minor) pain.</li><li> Colonists with the "Tough" trait reduce all incoming damage by half.</li><li> Most impressively, unless a body part has been completely destroyed, pawns can heal from <em>anything</em> just by resting long enough. This includes things like maimed inner organs and limbs shredded by artillery fire.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a>: When all of your colonists have been down, one of these will arrive to join your colony, armed with a pistol and wearing a flak vest. Though this can easily be seen as the game throwing you a bone, given that it could've taken a large raid or a massive manhunter pack to end your colony and that they would still be present, not to mention that the newcomer's stats are randomized and thus standing a good chance of being poorly optimized for ranged combat if not combat <em>in general</em>, this can very well be a <em>very</em> short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>: Cataphract armor is a class of heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> suits that provides unrivalled protection at the cost of a massive speed penalty, making the wearer nearly invincible but very, very slow. Fortunately, bionic legs can offset the penalty and turn your fighters into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>: Every so often, your colony will be bombarded with psychic probes. Sometimes they'll drive the local wildlife insane; other times they'll try to do the same to your colonists by inflicting them with a significant mood penalty (though thankfully the effect is temporary). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The one exception is the psychic wave caused by the crashed spaceship part, which is not only persistent but steadily gets worse until you finally destroy the part itself.</span><ul><li> Interestingly you can do this yourself to enemies with two incredibly rare and expensive artifacts: the Psychic Insanity Lance drives a character berserk (which means a chance to attack their friends), while the Psychic Shock Lance stuns and has a high chance of causing permanent brain damage.</li><li> There's also the more mundane options, like taking someone prisoner, locking them in a tiny, dark room, and letting them stew until they go insane.</li><li> The most extreme version of this is the psycast "Neuroquake". It causes <em>every living thing on the map</em> outside a small radius around around the caster go violently insane, and reduces your reputation with every single faction on the planet regardless of where they are located. Incedently the caster isnt immune either; they go into a three day coma after casting it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Minimalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Minimalism">Minimalism</a>: At its most basic, the design sensibility is similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonArchitect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonArchitect">Prison Architect</a></em> &mdash; baroque gameplay, minimalist visuals. Living things are generally not animated, <em>per se</em>, having just a few poses and otherwise gliding around. They also are always drawn without limbs or facial features, and are thus often referred to as "pawns". Other visuals are also simple, and details tend to be more informational than pretty. For example, a glance might convey how fully-grown a plant is, or how damaged a structure is, but otherwise they look plain and undistracting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight">Minmaxer's Delight</a>: Certain Traits can make a game easier. Hard Worker and Industrious shave off work times, Fast Walkers and Joggers run circles around others, Sanguine and Optimist are permanent mood boosts, and Transhumanist gets a sizeable mood bonus for each artificial part they have. Getting several of them on the same pawn can be extremely powerful and makes for a pawn most players will sacrifice half their colony to protect, especially if they also have an interest in a valuable skill like Crafting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovCocktail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovCocktail">Molotov Cocktail</a>: A favourite weapon for enemy sappers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">for obvious reasons</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoraleMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoraleMechanic">Morale Mechanic</a>: Every character has a mood meter, which reflects their general satisfaction with the state of the colony and their personal quality of life. Too many negative thoughts can push a colonist into a mental breakdown.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor</a>: It doesn't matter how lush your colony's map used to be when a Toxic Fallout event happens - if it drags on for more than a few days, all that's left is a barren wasteland choked with dead trees and rotting animal carcasses. It takes a very long time for nature to recover after such a disaster, which can easily result in a colony wipe if you're dependent on hunting for survival or failed to construct roofs over your crop fields.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneDogmatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneDogmatic">Mundane Dogmatic</a>: While it's a far-future setting, technology is restricted to the plausible (if obviously very advanced). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentAliens">true aliens</a> are noticeably absent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">Mutual Kill</a>: Very common among wild animals. They have no way to patch up bleeding, so if they manage to kill an opponent but suffer too many wounds in the process, the blood loss will eventually kill them. It's not uncommon to see a predator lying dead next to their half-eaten prey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NailedToTheWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NailedToTheWagon">Nailed to the Wagon</a>:<ul><li> One way of dealing with a colonist who has a crippling addiction? Literally cripple them by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralDisarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralDisarming">removing their legs</a>. They will be unable to leave bed, and thus unable to get their drug of choice. Other colonists will bring them food while they recuperate, and once the addiction has been thoroughly broken, their legs can be restored using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimb">bionics</a>. It's ugly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight">but it works</a>.</li><li> Arrested prisoners will never leave their room, even to feed an addiction, and you can arrest your own colonists (though failure to arrest can lead to violence). Colonists can keep your addicted prisoners fed til they get over their drug addiction. Downsides can include them being unhappy when they're finally let out due to being arrested by their own colony, or possibly a prison break, which can potentially render the entire thing pointless if you can't re-arrest them before they find their drug supply.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">Nanomachines</a>: Mechanites are microscopic mechanoids, and they are used for medical purpose in advanced planets. But in Rimworld, they are uncontrolled state and treated as painful yet somewhat beneficial diseases.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNativesAreRestless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNativesAreRestless">The Natives Are Restless</a>: Low-tech human tribes populate most planets, and many (though not all) of them start out hostile to your colony. They'll often send out raiding parties to cause what havoc they can. Players can also play as them, if they choose one of the default starting options which became available as of Alpha 14.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>: Other factions outside your colony will put the blame on you whenever their visitors get killed or injured by anything that is not your doing. Fortunately, if said victims returned fully recovered from the incident, it will give a significant boost to your relationship with them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>: Colonists with the Kind trait will occasionally say nice things to improve the moods of other colonists, will never insult others and don't judge anyone by their appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleWolf">Noble Wolf</a>: While man-eating wargs are almost always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves">Savage Wolves</a> (for which see below), most non-event-spawned warg packs are harmless unless otherwise provoked. With the appropriate skills they can be tamed to serve as animal companions for your colonists and can perform most of the same roles as dogs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind">No Body Left Behind</a>: Nuking an area with an Antigrain Warhead leaves absolutely nothing but empty ground behind - no plants, no bodies, no items of any kind remain at the site of impact. Don't do this if you intend to take prisoners or scavenge animal resources. Given that you just dropped a <em>starship-grade antimatter bomb</em> on your target, this is actually quite realistic, with the only reason the ground is still there afterwards probably being game engine restrictions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoConservationOfEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoConservationOfEnergy">No Conservation of Energy</a>: The Vanometric power cell generates electricity without using any fuel, forever. This technology was developed by archotech AIs, and no humans can understand how this techology works.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">No Party Like a Donner Party</a>: One of the options available for butchering and preparing meat from corpses? <em>Human</em>. It's usually best reserved for an absolute last-ditch emergency to fend off starvation, as butchering and eating human meat impacts most characters' moods negatively (unless they're cannibals by nature themselves). If you start in a sufficiently freezing biome then resorting to this might be a <em>requirement</em> to survive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>:<ul><li> Some people in Rimworld have the "Psychically Deaf" trait, and they aren't affected by psychic phenomena. They don't receive bad feelings from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">psychic drone</a>, but they are unable to get good feelings from psychic sooth.</li><li> Sufficiently strong armor can completely negate incoming attacks. For instance, top-tier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> makes the pawn wearing it practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, with only dedicated anti-armor guns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">Energy Weapons</a> being able to punch through the plating.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsDehydration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsDehydration">No Such Thing as Dehydration</a>: Establishing a constant food supply is one of the first challenges a new colony needs to overcome. The only drinks in the game are late game drugs (beer and go-juice) which can be avoided entirely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">Not the Intended Use</a>: Rimworld suffers from a particularly sad case of this. The game is not designed to be a long-term colony management sim. The player is supposed to make a stable colony, build a ship and end the game after a period of time. If the player has grown too attached to their colony and keeps on playing indefinitely, eventually so many things will need to be processed that the game's performance will slow to a crawl. Mods exist to remedy the issue, but the problem will still return after a while as the core problem lies in the game's lack of multithread support.<ul><li> Additionally, colonies that are played for longer than the developer intended will begin to run out of resources, especially steel, as without mods most resources are not renewable. It's not unusual for late-stage colonies to grow vast fields of drugs to sell and constantly call in traders just to get the steel and plasteel they need to keep going. Fortunately, the 1.1 Update changed mechanics of the ground-penetrating scanner and now it allows you to detect and mine an indefinite amount of minerals in the map, so it became less of an issue.</li><li> Similarly, the game has a set population limit which restricts how many new arrivals the colony will receive. After a certain number of colonists arrive, the storyteller will not use any more events that give the player new colonists outright (i.e. wanderers joining or transport pod crashes) and the only way to recruit new colonists is by recruiting prisoners. It becomes increasingly difficult to gain more colonists after you reach a population of about twenty or so.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft">Organ Theft</a>: If you're squeamish about <em>literally</em> cannibalizing your prisoners but still want to use them as a "renewable resource," you can have doctors surgically remove certain organs such as their lungs, kidneys, and heart (the latter of which obviously kills them instantly). This causes a mood penalty for most colonists though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverdrawnAtTheBloodBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverdrawnAtTheBloodBank">Overdrawn at the Blood Bank</a>: Bleeding creatures leave fairly large bloodstains on the ground wherever they go, and if the wound isn't serious enough to kill them quickly, they can lose what looks like hundreds of liters of blood before they finally succumb. Happens most often to animals wounded by predators or stray gunfire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintTheTownRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintTheTownRed">Paint the Town Red</a>: Late-game raids have a large number of attackers, and killing all of them will paint the ground red. This is not very good, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">because things like pools of blood or corpses decrease the beauty rating and give bad feelings to colonists</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">Panthera Awesome</a>: Taming cougars or panthers is obviously dangerous, but they have potential to become fragile yet very agile attack animals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostApocalypticDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostApocalypticDog">Post-Apocalyptic Dog</a>: Starting with Alpha 12, your starting group includes a dog that can be trained to help defend your colony and serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanineCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanineCompanion">Canine Companion</a> for one of your survivors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Power at a Price</a>:<ul><li> Luciferium is a very powerful glitterworld "drug" that enhances colonists to superhuman workers who are immune to disease and remain in perfect health... but they have to keep taking it or the nanomachines in the drug will break down, drive them insane, and eventually kill them.</li><li> Mountain bases are virtually impervious to mortar bombardment and drop pod attacks, easy to defend from ground assaults, and mostly unaffected by outside temperatures. You pay for these perks with most of your pawns going nuts after being stuck underground for too long, and the not-insignificant threat of massive swarms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Big Creepy-Crawlies</a> tunneling into your base out of nowhere, setting up nests and overrunning your colony from within.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour">Powered Armour</a>: A late game research allows you to build suits of power armor, or it can (rarely) be scavenged off pirates. It comes in three varieties too. Recon Armor is the cheapest, and does not slow down the pawn at all. Marine Armor is in the middle of the pack, able to soak a reliable amount of damage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">negate</a> the rest of the damage taken, with better quality suits being nigh invulnerable. Cataphract Armor needs the most requirements, locked behind two reasearch locks and slows the pawn down a lot, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">nullifies</a> most attacks completely, and the best quality suits make their wielder practically invulnerable to anything without armor penetration.<ul><li> To compliment this, there are also alternate version of all three armors that each have additional abilities with less protection as a trade off. Locust Armor is Recon Armor with a built in Jetpack, Grenadier Armor is Marine Armor with a Built in Grenade Launcher with two shots, and Phoenix Armor is Cataphract Armor with a single use Incendiary Launcher that makes the wearer near fireproof. All of these need more materieals and research, but can make already deadly colonists able to wipe out small groups with ease if they are kitted out right.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStrainBlackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStrainBlackout">Power-Strain Blackout</a>: Using psychic powers causes a buildup of "neural heat" in the caster; too much and they're increasingly likely to pass out from the strain. The only way to avoid this is to let it dissipate, either naturally (the rate of which can be boosted by various bits of equipment, with the potential for casters to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> with Eltex Robes &amp; Staves, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> thanks to Prestige Power Armour) or by shunting some of it into a willing ally (who will <em>immediately</em> pass out).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerilousOldFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerilousOldFool">Perilous Old Fool</a>: Enemy factions sometimes send very old raiders into your colony. They are usually weaker than younger raiders, because they often have bad health conditions like cataracts, bad back, or frail.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">Procedural Generation</a>:<ul><li> Since Alpha 7, the surface of planets are created with this, each one given a name based on a four-character seed inputted by the player.</li><li> People are also generated by routines that build a variety of physical and mental makeups, as well as a social history. This includes raiders, refugees, and other random-event people, as any of them has the potential to join your colony.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: The Royalty DLC adds psychic powers to the game. Psycasters can use various psychic powers, both for offensive, defensive, and utility purposes. Abilities range from briefly stunning a single target to creating temporary cover to driving all humanoids within a small area into a berzerk rage (with predictable results if cast into the middle of a mob of raiders). Outside of combat, a range of "Word of" abilities can make targets fall in love with the caster, end an mental breakdown at the cost of knocking the target unconscious for a few hours, and so on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPartyMember">Psycho Party Member</a>: Certain traits will make a particular colonist more likely to break under the strain by giving them either a higher breakdown threshold, a permanent penalty to their mood, or increased susceptibility to psionic attacks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac">Pyromaniac</a>: Colonists with the "Pyromaniac" trait have a chance to start fires in anytime. They can feel good by having an incendiary weapon, but they can never extinguish fires. Their propensity for incendiary incidents makes the trait extremely undesirable, and some players may rather banish a colonist or send them on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a> than deal with the constant fires.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">Rage Breaking Point</a>: Push a character hard enough and drive their morale down low enough and they may fly into a rage, attacking any people and objects in their path until they're subdued.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>: Your first survivors will usually come from widely diverse backgrounds, with some of them possibly being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">almost ridiculously incompetent</a> at performing basic survival skills.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>: Alpha 16 introduces caravans that can travel the world. As they're moving, they can be ambushed by roving pirates and mad animals, which creates a temporary map to deal with the threat and regroup before reforming the caravan and moving again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEventsPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEventsPlot">Random Events Plot</a>: The "Randy Random" AI Storyteller option invokes this, throwing out random events with no real rhyme or reason to their sequence or intensity (unlike the other two AI Storyteller options, who at least follow some sort of logical progression).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight">Rant-Inducing Slight</a>: One possible mental break a colonist can undergo is the "insult spree", where being pushed over the edge provokes the colonist to launch a stream of invective at everyone they can get within earshot. This is one of the worst breaks as being insulted causes negative mood and opinions for the victims as well, potentially causing more breaks down the line.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a>: Raiders will attempt to burn crops, destroy property, and abduct wounded colonists if there aren't any active defenders to engage. If they destroy enough, they'll eventually get fed up and go home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>: This can happen, sometimes rather often.<ul><li> Assign a colonist as a chef with mediocre cooking skills, or use a filthy room as a kitchen? Some meals will be tainted, causing food poisoning. Whilst this is rarely lethal, characters with food poisoning will suffer penalties from being in pain (such as moving slower) and need to eat more food later to recover. This is a particular danger for new players, since butcher's tables are quite dirty and players may be inclined to put the two close together for convenience.</li><li> Forget to treat a Colonist's wound? They'll be incapacitated if they haven't died from blood loss. Do a poor job treating a wound, they'll have scars and will be susceptible to future damage.</li><li> Survive a headshot (That damages the brain) or a shattered spine?

Most food (and some other goods, like herbal medicine) eventually goes bad if they aren't kept in a frozen room.</li><li> Smoking too much smokeleaf can eventually lead to asthma or lung cancer. Likewise, excessive alcohol can lead to cirrhosis of the liver even setting aside the effects of addiction.</li><li> Some actions like seeing human corpses in the open, butchering and eating human flesh, wearing clothes crafted from human leather, or killing prisoners (or leaving them to die) have a negative impact on your colonists, unless the colonists have specific traits which often also have detrimental consequences (psychopath<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4z1f0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4z1f0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4z1f0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">without any mood boost from socialization, the occasional insults RNG generates from social interactions would eventually result in the psychopath becoming enemy with every other colonist, without any way to counter it; it would result in frequent fights, which result in waste of time, medical supplies, and manpower (the time to heal both fighters)</span>, bloodlust<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5lfeq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5lfeq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5lfeq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">much more likely to start a fight with a fellow colonist</span>) or the cannibal trait<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note66hpe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note66hpe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note66hpe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">allows to eat human flesh without a hit to morale, which has no negative consequence but takes a slot which could be filled by something genuinely useful</span>. In short, guys who have no issue in seeing their acquaintances dying, cooking human meat, wearing human leather clothes, murdering prisoners in their cells, leaving corpses rotting in the outside, etc. are messed up and would be a pain to manage anyway.</li><li> On a (slightly) more positive note, explosions extinguish fires in this game as in real life. This is risky but can erase some of the dangers of a fire.</li><li> Most nobles continue to work their allotted tasks normally regardless of their title, except for the so-called "conceited nobles" that refuse to do anything productive because they were already Greedy, Jealous or Abrasive before they ascended to nobility. Turns out giving entitled bastards a royal title is not the brightest idea. Fortunately you can control who gets all the fame and associated titles.</li><li> Recruiting visitors from other factions into your colony tends to incur a hefty reputation drop with their now-former chief. Most bosses take a dim view of others poaching their best and brightest. Likewise, turning visitors into rations, or even just allowing visitors to be seriously harmed by raiders or manhunting animals, will upset most chiefs. The unwritten rules of hospitality are deadly serious on the Rim. On the flipside, rescuing the wounded and patching them up can be a great way to mend damaged relations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>: Starting with Alpha 9, the game draws a distinction between a character's biological age (how much time they've actually spent as a growing, self-aware being) and chronological age (the amount of time that has passed between their birth and the present day). In some extreme cases, physically young characters may often be anywhere from several decades to a few millennia old due to extended stays in cryptosleep.

There's also "compacted plasteel", which is exceptionally rare, but one of the few free sources of the precious blue metal - it's stronger and lighter than common steel, making it a great choice for armour, shields, and low-tech melee weapons.

If that last siege was just too much, and your base is swarming with mechanoids, bugs, raiders or what have you, you can always just pack what you can with your colonists and leave for a nearby location on the world to try again instead of starting a new save.

It is also possible, with clever construction or luck, to funnel raiders into an insect hive or sleeping mechanoid cluster and let them wipe each other out. One can even manage to trick a mechanoid cluster or insect hive to attack each other, as they are automatically hostile because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">the insect hives were engineered to fight mechanoids</a>.</li><li> Psychic Insanity Lances exist to take advantage of this.

This is a particularly effective way to break apart a raid with someone who is wielding a rocket launcher.</li><li> With the <em>Royalty</em> DLC installed, psychic pawns can have up to two powers that induce the Berserk state in other pawns, with one being single-target and the more powerful one having a decent area of effect. The latter in particular can neutralize entire raids almost on its own. A third power also allows them to drive all <em>animals</em> in an area into a manhunting rage; whilst this is of only minor use in vanilla (few if any factions make serious use of battle animals, and turning the local wildlife against raiders is probably not going to particularly effective) it can be much more potent with mods that have faction raiders who bring wardogs or even ride into battle atop trusty steeds. Those fancy medieval knights might not feel quite so brave when their horses have bucked them off and are trampling them into the dirt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettlingTheFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettlingTheFrontier">Settling the Frontier</a>: The basic idea of the game, though it wasn't (necessarily) your colonists' intention since the starship they traveled on tore itself apart for some reason and they just barely got to the escape pods in time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpenedToASingleAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpenedToASingleAtom">Sharpened to a Single Atom</a>: Monoswords are implied to be this.

Depending on the map layout and your pawns' equipment, getting rid of them before they start shelling your base into oblivion can be anything but trivial. Unsurprisingly, having a battery of mortars of your own makes sieges a whole lot less threatening. Building your base inside a mountain is another good defense against mortar bombardment (has its own downsides, though), and you can return the favor by bringing mortars along for attacking the raiders' faction bases. Bonus points if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">those mortars are the same ones they attacked you with</a>, captured by you after the siege was broken.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleBiomePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleBiomePlanet">Single-Biome Planet</a>: While the default setting generates planets with varied biomes, you can make single biome planets with changing settings on the world generation screen.

What makes it this trope instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> is that the Short Circuit event shows there are clearly no breakers in Rimworld, so a cascading failure would be impossible without this trope being in effect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolarFlareDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolarFlareDisaster">Solar Flare Disaster</a>: One of the random events in the game is a solar flare that knocks out all electrical devices for about a day or so. If you live in an inhospitable biome and rely on a greenhouse to grow crops and need coolers to keep food from going bad, then that can be <em>very bad</em>. It can also spell doom if it happens to a colony reliant on automated defenses while a raid is ongoing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperStarship">Sleeper Starship</a>: The chief means of space travel, as humanity is restricted to slower-than-light propulsion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The end goal of the game is to jury-rig one for your castaways to escape in.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowMeansDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowMeansDeath">Snow Means Death</a>: Snowfall generally heralds the beginning of winter and thus the end of the growing season, so while it's not dangerous on its own, the cold that comes with it can definitely be if you haven't stockpiled enough food to last you through the winter. Naturally, Ice Sheet biomes deliberately invoke this at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">game's deadliest extremes</a>. Food is very hard to come by: there's no wildlife to hunt or tame, and growing crops is generally not an option unless you construct a special greenhouse where hardy potatoes can possibly be grown in the underlying gravel; trading for food will be your main lifeline (assuming it's not so cold that they simply leave to avoid frostbite), and cannibalising slain raiders (or even <em>visitors</em>) may be a <em>requirement</em> to survive. On the upside, snow brings death to all; the sheer cold makes diseases rare, and human enemies rarely show up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">and when they do, the elements usually deal with them even if your defences don't.</a> And hey, at least you're not short on freezer space when the entire map is sub-zero.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirate</a>: One possible enemy.

"Eltex" gear increases this sensitivity, but somehow provides slightly <em>worse</em> protection against incoming damage than <em>cloth</em> gear of the same quality level. In the case of two casters going head to head, whoever goes first will probably win; a normal pawn might only be stunned for a couple of seconds, but a highly-sensitive psycaster with Eltex gear can use their powers more but will be out of the fight twice as long at the very least if hit by that same Stun power.</li><li> Averted: A Pawn with either the Psychically Sensitive or Psychically Hypersensitive traits, which provide +40% and +80% Psychic Sensitivity respectively, might not need Eltex gear to be an effective Psycaster, and there are no penalties for wearing normal armour. To top this off there is a special version of all the endgame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmour">Power Armour</a> that increases a pawn's Psychic Sensitivity without sacrificing any protection (though not as much as a boost as Eltex gear gives).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>: The game has several explosive weapons and explosives, and notable ones are:<ul><li> The Doomsday Rocket Launcher is a disposable/single-shot weapon, firing a single rocket which causes a large initial explosion followed by a half-dozen smaller incendiary blasts moments later.</li><li> "Boom"-animals are like regular animals except they've been engineered to naturally produce explosive chemicals within large yellowish sacs on their bodies. These sacs will react violently if they are shot or otherwise punctured. This makes them <em>extremely</em> risky to hunt despite the potential of harvesting useful materials, and <em>God help you</em> if they become hostile and attack.</li><li> High-explosive shells are the standard mortar ammo for all factions, dealing a decent 50 points of damage in a 3x3 area.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter">Antigrain</a> Warhead is a very rare mortar shell.

This includes all sorts of furniture and equipment, other pawns and even the largest animals like thrumbos (which weigh in at 400+kg) or elephants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>: Boomrats and boomalopes go up in a fiery explosion when killed&mdash;attack them in melee at your peril. Conversely, improvised turrets can do this on enemies dumb enough to attack them with melee weapons (usually Tribals) as they spark and explode when they take too much damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels">Technology Levels</a>: The game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree">Tech Tree</a> is divided into six eras, arranged in ascending order: neolithic, medieval, industrial, spacer, ultra and archotech<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8zs4x');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8zs4x" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8zs4x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">only available for research in modded games</span>, all of which follow the exact same paths even when you're playing a lost neolithic tribe that's been out of touch with Earth-like tech for centuries, if not millennia. Researching a technology outside your colony's current tech level incurs a +100% research time penalty, but that's their only meaningful distinction so far.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a>: Antigrain Warheads are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">Antimatter</a> weapons meant to be used by starships against against other starships.

Characters with this trait will stay away from alcohol, and may dislike characters who don't. Conversely, characters who enjoy drink will look down on teetotalers, which can lead to some friction in colonies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirstyDesert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirstyDesert">Thirsty Desert</a>: Deserts are at the hot and dry extreme of the biome scale. The main challenges there come from heat exhaustion and a relative lack of timber and quality soil for farming.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill">This Is a Drill</a>: A colonist with the Drill Arm from Royalty DLC can bore the body of enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeQuartersView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeQuartersView">Three Quarters View</a>: For the local map where the main gameplay (player colony, caravan encounters etc.) takes place; the world map uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView">Top-Down View</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense">Tower Defense</a>: The game wasn't designed to fit into this genre from the start, but certain tactical considerations (defending a single colony against multiple waves of enemies with a focus on using carefully-placed turrets and traps to bolster your defenses, where losses on your side take time and investment to replace but the enemy can keep throwing more and larger waves at you) mean that it edges into this during raids.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a>: Espoused by characters with the appropriate trait. They get mood bonuses if you replace their limbs and organs with improved bionic parts, and view other colonists with such enhancements in a more favourable light.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy">Trigger Happy</a>: Characters with the trait that shares this trope's name <em>love</em> shooting guns, which results in a higher rate of fire than normal (at the cost of a significant accuracy penalty).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic">Troperiffic</a>: There are tons of references the game possesses by far. All you can do now is to find them all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>: It's perfectly possible for a couple to have characteristics that make them hate each other while also being in love. For example, a woman with the misandry trait might have a man as a lover, and her opinion of him will have a negative for "man" balanced by a positive for "lover".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity">Underground City</a>: A possible colony build, usually inside mountains, but it reeks with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> investments which requires a lot of man-hours digging through and a ton of resources to build a sustainable habitat inside. Colonists will also grow increasingly weary if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CabinFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CabinFever">they stay too long inside</a>. This is a viable strategy, on the other hand, if your colonists get stranded in the middle of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowMeansDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowMeansDeath">Ice Sheet</a>. Too much digging can lead to another kind of hazard: hostile insects building hives in your tunnels. Fortunately, leaving them alone for a while will cause them to generate valuable insect jelly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndressingTheUnconscious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndressingTheUnconscious">Undressing the Unconscious</a>: Any pawn is capable of stripping another when they're unconscious, including Raiders or neutral NPCs. Due to the mechanic where clothes and armor getting a "Tainted Apparel" mood debuff when the pawn wearing them dies, this has the unintended side effect of players prioritizing their pawns to strip downed enemies during Raids and then leaving them to bleed out naked on the floor, while hauling off their clothes and equipment back to base. Rescuing them is also possible, but players are unlikely to do that unless they have good stats.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalCurrency">Universal Currency</a>: Silver is the trade medium across the planet, and even most of space, apparently. Other precious materials like gold and jade exist and are highly valued, but all trade is measured by its value in silver.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspecifiedApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspecifiedApocalypse">Unspecified Apocalypse</a>: What caused the civilisation that built the ancient highways, vaults full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicles</a> and other remnants of advanced industrialisation and technology to collapse is left up to the player's own interpretation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment">Unusable Enemy Equipment</a>:<ul><li> Averted for human enemies, whose weapons are dropped when they're killed or incapacitated and can be repurposed accordingly, but played straight for mechanoid enemies. You can never get their weapons from their dead bodies.</li><li> Played straight with the biocoded weapons introduced in version 1.1, which are tied to one specific person and can't be used by anyone else. Enemy raiders sometimes come equipped with these. Taken a step further with "death acidifier" implants, which cause all worn clothes and held weapons to disintegrate if the character with the acidifier dies. They're mostly used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> to keep that shiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmour">Power Armour</a> from falling into the hands of filthy tribal scum, naturally.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">Unwilling Roboticisation</a>: You can force body purists to get bionic limbs, but they'll suffer a significant mood penalty. Don't be surprised if they snap on you if you aren't paying attention.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact">Upgrade Artifact</a>: Neurotrainer mech serum, a Glitterworld-manufactured container of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">mechanites</a> administered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">around the orb of the eye</a>. They rapidly form new neural pathways in the brain to grant experience in a skill, even if the one undergoing the treatment had no prior experience with it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> that the <em>Royalty</em> DLC revolves around is actually the splintered remnant of a much larger interstellar empire that fell to unspecified aggressors. The survivors fled and made a new home on the same rimworld you crash-landed on. However, vestigial or not, they're still an ultratech-level society with extremely advanced equipment including a fleet of space warships, so tread carefully when dealing with them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential">Videogame Caring Potential</a>:<ul><li> You can rescue crashed survivors and recruit them into your colony, train pets to become bonded animals, and save fleeing refugees from enemy marauders. You're also rewarded for being kind to prisoners, housing them in good cells and keeping them well-fed and socialized with your wardens, and can show proper respect for the dead on both sides of any battle by giving them beautiful graves and sarcophagi.</li><li> Following certain updates, you can offer food and shelter to weary travelers, who will offer to work for you as well. If you are really nice to them, their members will even join your colony.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">Videogame Cruelty Potential</a>: As with other base-building games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, there is no end to the amount of cruelty you can get up to.<ul><li> There is absolutely nothing stopping a willing player from, through careful choosing and weeding out "undesirable" traits, creating a colony filled mostly with psychopaths and the like.</li><li> There is nothing at all stopping a player from inflicting horrifying fiery deaths upon enemies using incendiary launchers and molotov cocktails, as well as mulching them in various deadfall traps and blowing them apart with various improvised bombs. And that's not factoring in that a clever player can trigger mechanoid attacks on incoming raiders.</li><li> Speaking of horrible traps, nothing stops the player from abusing the enemy A.I pawns to make them walk into obvious kill-boxes filled with turrets to blast them to smithereens or more terrifyingly, trap them into a maze and turning up(or down)the temperature to extreme levels to either scorch them to death or letting them die of hypothermia, only to use their burnt/frozen corpses as food for the colony animals and cannibals.</li><li> For that matter, you can easily take enemy survivors, strip them naked, and lock them up in tiny rooms in the cold or heat and leave them to starve. When they go berserk, you can beat them unconscious and throw them back in the cell, and deny them medical treatment. Note that you can also do this to <em>colonists</em> as well.</li><li> Wounded survivors of crashing escape pods can be brought back to the colony to be healed... or they can be stripped of their possessions and left to die in the wilderness. Or you can capture them and sell them as slaves to a passing trade caravan.</li><li> As noted above, you can take a prisoner, execute them, and then have them butchered and served as a meal while making their skin into clothing. You can also do this to a colonist's beloved pet.</li><li> That's right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenuineHumanHide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenuineHumanHide">you can harvest workable leather from fallen human raiders or even your colonists.</a> You can craft an impressive quality leather armchair out of dead raiders that all your colonists will agree is beautiful and comfortable to sit in!</li><li> One of the recommended methods for training doctors is to take prisoners from a raid, then replace their legs with peg legs and harvest their organs until they die. Even if you choose not to kill a captured prisoner in this way, you can still amputate both of their legs and install peg legs, remove their jaw and put in a denture, and harvest one kidney and one lung and send them on their way. As long as they are part of a permanently hostile faction such as pirates, you will not experience a decrease in relations. There is a small chance they may return as a raider, which makes them much easier to deal with. Plus, you'll be up one kidney and lung. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>.</li><li> Certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mods</a> offer even more cruelty options. One mod expands on the number of organs and body parts you can harvest from living people, letting you take off individual fingers, hands, feet, and more, and another allows you to use prisoners you've captured as prison labour, allowing you to run a full-on slave colony. You can also get a mod that allows you to individually modify any and every aspect of your colonists on creation, perfect for creating an entire clan of incestuous, psychopathic cannibal assholes, and then the world will really be your oyster!<ul><li> Expanding on the organ harvesting mod mentioned above: take raiders prisoner, cannibalize whatever body parts they still have until they croak, then send these parts to their faction as a gift. Body parts are valuable, so the usual result will be said faction turning friendly because you sent them back their friends in bits and pieces. Feel free to roleplay this tactic any way you like.</li></ul></li><li> While your own colonists take a big mood penalty from eating human meat, there's nothing stopping you from feeding it to prisoners. With the right butcher (one who doesn't mind butchering humans, such as a psychopath, cannibal, or someone with the Bloodlust trait), you can force those you capture to eat the meat of their fallen comrades&mdash;in the form of extra-disgusting nutrient paste. The prisoners will of course revolt, so it might be useful to cut off a few limbs to make subduing them easier.</li><li> Nothing says dehumanizing to your prisoners more than kibble made from human and insect meat. -35 mood, all from one serving of something that you shouldn't even feed dogs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPunishment">Videogame Cruelty Punishment</a>: At the same time, certain actions will have negative consequences...<ul><li> Colonist become angry and have negative moods if you unnecessarily execute prisoners, harvest their organs, or sell them into slavery. You also take a relation hit to that prisoner's faction, which may attack you. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">That said</a>, prisoners have a "found guilty" phase of about one day following their capture during which you can do to them whatever you want without your colonists giving a damn.</li><li> Amputating limbs or harvesting organs from prisoners that are not part of a permanently hostile faction will give you a serious relation hit, even if they were replaced with inferior prosthetics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">However</a>, you can more than offset the reputation penalty by sending them some of the harvested organs as a gift. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a></li><li> Serving (non-cannibal) colonists human meat will give them a large negative mood penalty and increase their chance of suffering a mental break if they have to endure it for very long. Serious mental breaks can cause them to go berserk, go on a murderous rage, or worse. This can also happen if you butcher a colonist's bonded pet or a family member.</li><li> Colonists who aren't cannibals or psychopaths receive a negative mood modifier when wearing clothes crafted from human skin.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGeography">Video Game Geography</a>: Alpha 16 averts the usual video game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldShapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldShapes">World Shapes</a> by changing the world from a square map into a sphere wrapped with hexagons and pentagons to allow players to traverse the entire surface with caravans. Square subdivisions would cause very large areas on the equator and very small areas on the poles, which would not be viable for colonization.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarElephants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarElephants">War Elephants</a>: Skilled trainers can use trained elephants as attack animals. They can't ride on them, though, unless you have the appropriate mods installed of course.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">Weather-Control Machine</a>: Tornado generator can generate a tornado. It will destroy anything nearby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">We Can Rebuild Him</a>: Colonists can have their limbs (and eyes, even) replaced with bionic parts, which are better than their organic counterparts. Transhumanists even gain a significant mood bonus for having a bionic part.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>: When it comes to the AI Storytellers, Randy Random is a rules-hating anarchist who doesn't care much for "consistency" or "fairness". He'll throw challenges of any difficulty at your colony at any time, and may even hurl multiple dangerous events at you at once or one after another with no respite. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Or he might go easy on you.</a> It's all just fun to him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a>: Sometimes, a wild man (or woman) appears in your colony. They act like animals, but colonists with animal skills can recruit them by taming.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly">Wizard Needs Food Badly</a>:<ul><li> Colonists need food to function. Let them go hungry too long, and they'll starve to death (if they don't get killed by someone else after going berserk, as extreme hunger creates highly negative thoughts). The quality of the food they eat also affects their mood.</li><li> Though it won't kill them immediately, colonists do need cleanliness badly. Dirt, blood, vomit, and animal filth will lower a room's attractiveness and result in reduced moods, and a dirty environment increases the likeliness of disease and infections.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">Worst Aid</a>: In-universe, a particularly poor doctor may end up inflicting lethal damage to the neck for a leg-amputation, or they could successfully install a prosthetic arm... in the patient's hip. It can get even worse if your doctor gets drunk or takes drugs before starting the surgery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing">You Have Researched Breathing</a>: Beginning your colony at a higher tech level means that especially primitive technologies like brewing will have to be "re-learned", at a disadvantage. Other technologies that would reasonably be known to the people of urbworlds or glitterworlds, like carpet-making or passive cooling through evaporation, have to be relearned, but their research cost is relatively low, indicating that it's more about the colonists figuring out how to do something on their own that would have been left to factories or industries.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>: The favored tactic of hostile Tribal factions, who typically compensate for their primitive weaponry by sending out large groups of warriors in a melee rush. Same goes for insect hives in an almost literal example - no ranged weapons, but more than enough razor-sharp mandibles and claws to make up for it.</li></ul><hr>
