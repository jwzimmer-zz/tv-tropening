Then, once you get to the first town, you have to rescue Lillie's Pok&eacute;mon from attacking Spearow, only for <em>both</em> of you to be rescued by Tapu Koko. <em>THEN</em> you're given your Starter.

This makes it so players no longer have to memorize which buffs or debuffs are in effect or recall/look up type charts during battles. Really handy since many new Pok&eacute;mon introduced in this generation don't look their type.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0j9am');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0j9am" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0j9am');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that this is unavailable if it's the first time you've battled the creature.</span></li><li> When using Z-Power, if more than one attack will use the unique Z-Move, but one will make the Z-Move more powerful than the other, the game will mark the Z-Move that has more power with a glowing filter.</li><li> NPCs that battle the player on sight now have visual cues that distinguish them from harmless NPCs. They have a battle pose, and if the player gets close, the screen gains a letterbox effect.</li><li> Hyper Training allows your Pok&eacute;mon to gain stats equal to what its maximum IV would provide as long as that Pok&eacute;mon is level 100.</li><li> When you catch a new Pok&eacute;mon or try to take an Egg with a full party, you have the option to swap out a member of your team right there rather than having to backtrack to a PC. If you choose to send a new catch to the PC and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">holding an item</a>, the game will inform you and give you the option to send the item to your bag before the Pok&eacute;mon is boxed. If you choose to box an existing team member and it's holding an item, the game will let you take the item first. It also allows players to check what nature a Legendary Pok&eacute;mon has immediately instead of having to wait through a cutscene first.</li><li> The Rotom Pok&eacute;dex helps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhereWasIGoingAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhereWasIGoingAgain">keep track of the player's objectives</a>, which in previous games could sometimes be unclear. It also activates when a Pok&eacute;mon is registered via trading or evolution, something it did not do in previous games, the information becoming more readily available.</li><li> The HM mechanic is gone entirely (though some of the combat-practical HMs are converted to TMs); it is replaced by Ride Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> The Rotom Pok&eacute;dex and QR codes allow you to better track down wild Pok&eacute;mon, down to the specific patch of grass they can appear in.</li><li> Your Bag has a "Free Space" pocket, returning from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Black 2 and White 2</a></em>, where you can register items you frequently use (like healing items or Repels) into one pocket for easy access, rather than having to scroll through the rest of the bag.</li><li> Pok&eacute;mon Refresh lets you heal status effects without using up precious items or backtracking to a Pok&eacute;mon Center, which also means you won't need as many items to begin with since many players wait until after they finish a battle before healing up.</li><li> Pok&eacute; Beans can be "bought" by purchasing a drink at the cafe - the drink itself doesn't seem to actually have an effect other than receiving some beans from it. However, you can only receive 12 of them once a day.</li><li> In the previous games, if you evolve a Pok&eacute;mon at a later level than normal, the Pok&eacute;mon would miss out on any moves that the Pok&eacute;mon would have learned upon evolution. In <em>Sun and Moon</em>, the Pok&eacute;mon would instead learn the move after the evolution itself, permitting later evolution and earlier access to moves, given that the Pok&eacute;mon learns stronger moves at earlier levels if the Pok&eacute;mon is at an earlier evolutionary stage.</li><li> In a similar vein, the Move Relearner now teaches every move in a Pok&eacute;mon's level-up learnset, instead of the ones it would have learned at an earlier level, meaning that you no longer have to put off an evolution until the Pok&eacute;mon learns the move you want.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19r70');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19r70" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19r70');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though it will still not allow you to relearn moves that are exclusive to a previous evolution.</span> This also has the added effect of, should you so desire, certain Pok&eacute;mon (the ones that require specific moves) evolving almost instantly.</li><li> The "breeding" and "leveling" aspect of the Pok&eacute;mon Day Care have been separated. The new "Nursery" is now solely a breeding facility, which lets you breed Pok&eacute; without worrying about their movesets getting overwritten, which used to be a <em>huge</em> thorn in the player's side as they were trying to breed on Egg moves. As for where the leveling bit went, that's now a Pok&eacute; Pelago feature, and allows up to eighteen boxed Pok&eacute;mon to gain EXP at once while you're off doing your own thing - and that thing doesn't even need to be related to the game, as Pok&eacute; Pelago runs in real time regardless of if you're playing or not. You can also donate Beans to accelerate the process further.</li><li> The Hidden Power checker is now in the breeding center, saving you a trip when breeding for a particular Hidden Power.</li><li> The Pok&eacute; Pelago in general helps cut down on having to travel to four different locations to do some tedious things. It has a Berry Farm that no longer requires checking in to get the max yield, a cave that can get you various items, including evolution stones, a training area that can not only level up Pok&eacute;mon but also their stat EVs, and finally a Hot Springs that not only helps raise Friendship of Pok&eacute;mon but can slowly hatch Eggs as well.</li><li> The post-game allows a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastForwardMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastForwardMechanic">Fast-Forward Mechanic</a>, by way of traveling to a parallel universe with a twelve hour difference, to bypass all the time-restricted events such as encounters and Zygarde cell collection.</li><li> You can take a job once per day to remove Pyukumuku from the beach and receive 20,000 Pok&eacute;dollars, cutting down on the money grinding and having to go though the Battle Buffet and Elite four runs. In addition, you sometimes receive sellable items from some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreexistingEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreexistingEncounters">Preexisting Encounters</a> and by fishing and breaking rocks.</li><li> The stats judge, instead of having to go to him for an evaluation each time, will instead install a judge feature onto the PC, allowing you to check all of your Pok&eacute;mon at a glance from any PC in the game, saving you lots and lots of trips whenever you're hatching eggs. In addition, it now shows you all the values in a hexagon chart with labels, with "Best" being a maximum IV and "No Good" being a minimum IV. Unlocking this feature is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> task, though.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2pogc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2pogc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2pogc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hatch 21 eggs for him to do it.</span></li><li> The two versions of the game allow you to obtain multiple copies of the version-exclusive Ultra Beasts and legendary, allowing you to trade them for the ones you're missing.</li><li> You no longer have to go back to the PC to free up a space in your party just so you can take an egg from the Pok&eacute;mon Nursery, whereas previous installments of the series forced you to free up a space in your party just so you could take one. Additionally, you have the option of sending the egg directly to the PC if you don't want to hatch it immediately instead of having it added to your party whether you like it or not or being forced to box one of your other Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> Due to how helpful the Move Reminder is and how scarce Heart Scales were in previous generations (forcing players to constantly hunt and catch Luvdisc in the <em>hope</em> that they would be holding one), Sun and Moon gives players a number of Heart Scales every time they visit the local Island restaurants and buy a meal. Unfortunately, this isn't pointed out to the player and they can easily run right past the restaurants as they're never required to enter them, thus being a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>. In addition, they can also be a tad pricey at times (with Sushi High Roller costing 4,000 per meal). Luckily, if the player defeated the local Kahuna, then once a day, the last item on each menu can be ordered for free, since the Kahuna pays for them. The Kahunas aren't interested in keeping their Heart Scales, so the player also receives double the amount than usual.</li><li> The Ability Capsule costs a whopping 200 BP in the 6th Generation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">for an item that only works once and doesn't give you access to Hidden Abilities</a>.

The games do have the Gen VI version of the Exp. Share, which gives every party member that didn't fight half of the experience gained. You cannot rematch any of the Trainers, either, and there is currently no known way of doing so.

This time, however, Mega Stones missing from the normal game are given out as participation prizes.

Four islands, Kahunas and Tapus, four trainers to battle at the Trainers School, four Pok&eacute;mon in a Battle Royal, and the story arguably focuses on the journey of 4 characters (the player character, Hau, Lillie and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gladion</span>).

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">destruction that was wrought</a> led the Tapu to remove themselves from being so involved in human affairs.

Furthermore, their pampering of the Normal-type Meowth led to the line developing into Dark-types (known as Evil in Japan) and Trial Captain Acerola, their descendant, is a Ghost-type trainer (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">she is a very sweet and noble character</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a>:<ul><li> Attacking Z-Moves bypass protection moves like Protect and Baneful Bunker, although the damage dealt is quartered.</li><li> Psychic Fangs works like Brick Break, destroying Light Screen/Reflect/Aurora Veil and then damaging the target.</li><li> Darkest Lariat, Incineroar's signature move, ignores the target's Defense and Evasion stat changes.</li><li> Moves used by Pok&eacute;mon with the Mold Breaker Ability are not affected by the target's Ability.

It's not hard for this to sweep an unprepared team. Steel-types will not save you here, as Salazzle and Salandit's Corrosion ignores Steel-type immunity to poisoning, and Salazzle knows Flame Burst to melt it down.</li><li> Totem Lurantis holds a Power Herb to make its first Solar Blade a 1-turn attack. It can also summon a Trumbeak that has Rock Blast to eliminate Bug, Flying and Fire-types that may threaten it. Take care of the Trumbeak, and it would then send a Castform. This might sound confusing, until you realize it can use Sunny Day to make Solar Blade a 1-turn attack again and boost the healing capacity of Synthesis.</li><li> Totem Vikavolt has a Charjabug as a partner &mdash; Charjabug's ability of Battery boosts Vikavolt's already high Special Attack, something the two are said to do in official lore. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a>, because all of the Totem Vikavolt's offensive attacks are physical<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3k1l0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3k1l0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3k1l0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bug Bite, Spark, and Vice Grip, to be more specific.</span>, meaning that Charjabug's Battery boost will be useless on it. Totem Vikavolt holds a Occa Berry, which reduces super-effective damage from Fire-type moves.</li><li> Totem Kommo-o will summon a Scizor as its second partner after the first, Hakamo-o, is dealt with; since Kommo-o has a double weakness to Fairy-type moves and Dragon-type moves have no effect on Fairy Pok&eacute;mon, Scizor is the perfect counter to anyone who would bring a Fairy-type Pok&eacute;mon to the battle. Totem Kommo-o also carries Flash Cannon to deal with Fairy-type Pok&eacute;mon itself. In addition, it may use Protect on the first turn to protect itself from attacks and it can summon its ally with little to no risk.

For instance, the second trial involves a Totem Wishiwashi, which can summon an Alomomola or a normal Wishiwashi; both these Pok&eacute;mon can use Helping Hand and a move that heals the Totem Beast, which in turn, helps it maintain its Schooling Ability. The fourth is a Lurantis that can summon a Castform who uses Sunny Day, which strengthens the Grass-Type Totem. The fifth is a Totem Vikavolt, whose partner is a Charjabug with the Battery Ability, which makes the Totem's Electric attacks more damaging. (And the Vikavolt itself has Vice Grip to punish any Trainers who think they can use a Ground Type to bring it down easily.).

The games also introduce Minior, which is a Pok&eacute;mon based on meteorites. During meteor showers, they break out of their shells when they fall to the ground before rising back up into the sky.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Creator Cameo</a>: Like in previous core series games, the player can visit the game developers, who are found in an office building in Heahea City.

Even among Pok&eacute;mon games made for the 3DS, this is unprecedented.</li><li> The HM system has been removed in favor of Pok&eacute; Rides. It's accessed by pressing Y, but if you're a veteran of the series, don't be surprised if you find yourself opening the Pok&eacute;mon menu when you need to fly. The NPC who gives you the Fly TM remarks on this change, and the two NPCs at Poni Breaker Coast also tell you they can't sell Surf and Waterfall as HMs.</li><li> You now switch Pok&eacute;mon by first pressing Y in the Pok&eacute;mon menu instead of it being part of the list of options on a Pok&eacute;mon. Downplayed if you were accustomed to moving them by dragging and dropping them with the stylus; now you have to hold the stylus on the Pok&eacute;mon you want to move for a second before you can move them that way, otherwise you get the same menu as if you'd selected it with A.</li><li> In previous games, when healing up at the Pok&eacute;mon Center, the nurse would say something in the vein of "Let me take your Pok&eacute;mon for a moment" and then heal your Pok&eacute;mon. In <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>, an extra A-press is required when the nurse says that line.</li><li> In the 6th generation, when a Pok&eacute;mon Mega Evolves, its speed and ability before Mega Evolving is used to calculate turn order. Now, the Pok&eacute;mon's speed and ability <em>after</em> Mega Evolving is used to calculate turn order.</li><li> Unlike the two previous generations, this game no longer allows to instantly close all open menus at once by pressing X. The X button now has different functions depending on the menu, none of which involves closing the menu.</li><li> In the previous generation, you can check a Pok&eacute;mon's moves during battle by holding L while selecting the move with either A or the stylus. Here, you can only check moves with L+A; selecting the move with the stylus will use the move, regardless of whether or not L is held. This won't affect you if you prefer using buttons instead of the touchscreen, but if you're used to the stylus controls, this can lead to situations where you accidentally use a move when you were checking to determine whether or not you actually wanted to use it.</li><li> Closed doors require an A-press before you can enter a building or room, when in previous core series games, you could either walk through them or have the player character open them automatically.</li><li> Since there are more than 4 Pok&eacute; Rides, you can't map them all at once. This leads to the player having to shuffle the Pok&eacute; Rides on the D-Pad.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding">Dance Party Ending</a>: At the end of the main story the player is treated to an extended cutscene in which the various captains, kahunas, and other major characters throw an elaborate festival in honor of Alola's new Champion.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>: Pok&eacute;mon under the effect of a Totem aura or Z-Power glare at their opponents.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemoBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemoBonus">Demo Bonus</a>: You can receive several goodies near the start of the game depending on how much you played the Special Demo Version, with the standout being an Ash-Greninja.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayedReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayedReaction">Delayed Reaction</a>: When Hau discovers the President of Aether Lusamine is over 40, he just says, "You are?"

You have to go all the way around through a secret part of Diglett's Tunnel to get there, requiring Machamp Shove (the final Pok&eacute; Ride, which you get long after your visit to Konikoni).

Being able to hit Pok&eacute;mon with such a powerful attack can one-shot kill most Pok&eacute;mon. While Normalium Z is the first to occur, Fightinium Z being Super-Effective against 5 types can prove itself to be very helpful in the early run. Other than the once per battle clause, there are no limits on how many times you can use it. Oh, and if a Pok&eacute;mon uses Protect or similar to block it, the opponent will still receive 25% damage and it doesn't miss.</li><li> There's a very rare chance (about 1%) of you finding a wild <em>Salamence</em> during SOS battles on Route 3.</li><li> A special Munchlax could be obtainable via Mystery Gift before January 11th, 2017. Despite starting out at Level 5, it has solid stats. And as soon as obtaining that Munchlax, the player can receive Snorlium Z, though it can't use it unless it has Giga Impact. Its moves include Happy Hour (which can increase money gained from battles) and Hold Back (which always leaves a wild Pok&eacute;mon with at least 1 HP remaining, making catching them easier.) What's more is that the Munchlax is marked as your own rather than as a traded Pok&eacute;mon, so obedience will never be a problem.</li><li> You can gain a Machop pretty early via in-game trade, right before the first Trial where the Boss is a Totem Gumshoos or Raticate depending on the game.</li><li> The Festival Plaza is one you have from nearly the beginning of the game. Among all the buildings you can have are: Food stalls that can provide stat boosts or level up Pok&eacute;mon by several levels, item stores that can sell the best items, including stat boosting ones, early in the game, Bounce Houses to boosts Pok&eacute;mon's stats, and lottery stores that you can draw from daily that have a better chance of getting rarer items the higher rank it is (including the coveted <em>Master Ball</em> from a "Big Dreams" lottery store). There's even a dye store where you can die White-colored clothes your favorite color (though the store of the Color you like might be exclusive to the other version<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8zru4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8zru4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8zru4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Red, Green, Orange, and Purple in <em>Sun</em>; Yellow, Blue, Navy Blue, and Pink in <em>Moon</em></span>, you can bring it to your Plaza though other players). The best part is that you don't need the game's normal currency to buy anything there, you use Festival Coins, which are earned very easily and quickly thanks to assisting other player characters that come to your Plaza or doing missions with other players online, which are constantly happening. The only downsides are the fact that when stores run out of inventory, they don't restock until the next day, and stores like the Haunted House or Lottery Stores can only be used once a day, but they're both easily negligible downsides.</li><li> Just before the second trial, you can obtain the TM for Scald, a very powerful (80 base power) Water-type move that may also burn the target. Teach it to one of the easily found local Water-types like Wishiwashi (whose Schooling forme has stats on par with legendaries) or Dewpider (whose Water Bubble ability doubles the power of its Water-type attacks), and you can run right over anything that doesn't resist Water for a large portion of the game.</li><li> Eevee can be found in the wild not too long after you reach Akala Island, and you can get an Eevee egg from the Nursery by talking to one of the breeders there. Because the Soothe Bell is obtained on Melemele Island, and Pok&eacute;mon Refresh is available since the game's first hour, it's highly possible to obtain an Espeon, Umbreon, or a Sylveon before even facing the the first totem on Akala. Evolving them gives a pretty large boost to their stats - and Sylveon is <em>trivially</em> easy to obtain. Further, similar to Salamence above, the wild Eevee on Routes 4 and 6 may call for help and summon an Espeon (during the day) or Umbreon (at night). This allows you to catch one directly and skip over the friendship grinding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a>: In the Battle Buffet, the way the rewards system works makes it so that if you get 25-49 servings of food, you get a Big Mushroom or HP Up which are continually useful in the aftergame. If you get 50+ servings of food, you get the much less useful Max Revive, especially in competitive play.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Lusamine, is a single mother who neglects her children due to an obsession with a mind-altering chemical; an obsession which started when her husband mysteriously vanished. She subsequently begins to grow more and more unhinged and proceeds to tell her children things like "if you're not beautiful enough to be worthy of my love, then I don't NEED you!", resulting in one of her children becoming psychologically damaged and the other joining a gang. The whole situation seems like it parallels real-life abusive situations, especially those involving drugs; although Lusamine is more financially well-off than most real-life cases, wealthy drug addicts/potential domestic abusers are not unheard of, either. Abuse and family seem to be a pretty big theme in Sun and Moon, especially given that Guzma is implied to have started Team Skull because his father beat him as a child. It takes the player's love and kindness to stop Lusamine and help show Lillie and Gladion the way, mirroring how intervention is often necessary to escape such situations in real life (although it is important to remember that intervention only works if it is done by someone who truly cares and knows what they're doing, otherwise there's a risk that things may get worse).</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">Doing In the Wizard</a>: Solgaleo/Lunala are revered in Alola for being the child and emissary of the sun/moon, akin to the mythical power over nature past legendaries had. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it turns out they're merely Ultra Beasts from a different world, and are anything but unique specimens with a relation to celestial bodies.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownOnTheFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownOnTheFarm">Down on the Farm</a>: Paniola Ranch, on Akala Island has the same feel.

The only ones who are really different in English are some of the trial captains (Lana and Sophocles being the big standouts), Faba, and Samson Oak (he falling victim to being related to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a>).

For example, Veterans extend their hands for a handshake or applaud the winner, female Preschoolers appear to be jumping for joy, and Cooks have an eyebrow raised while smiling.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrailInTheGarbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrailInTheGarbage">Grail in the Garbage</a>: You can buy artifacts associated with several legendary Pok&eacute;mon, including those of Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Groudon, and Kyogre at a small shop in Hau'oli Mall. This is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>, as it is impossible to transfer items between generations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicsInducedSuperdeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicsInducedSuperdeformed">Graphics Induced Superdeformed</a>: Averted.

The only way to find out that the facility directly to the right of the bridge into the castle (the first slot) is what is shared to other players if they ask "Do you know any good facilities?" is also easily missed.</li><li> Good luck finding all of the Zygarde cells. For one, nothing in the game tells you that some only appear in the daytime and others only appear at night. Likewise, you're not told just how many are left on a given island, meaning you could turn the entire region over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">just to find the very last one you missed</a>.</li><li> Some Pok&eacute;mon cannot be found by standard running through the grass, surfing on the water and so on. You'll need to do SOS battles, which is basically having the Pok&eacute;mon call for help. Which Pok&eacute;mon calls which and which Pok&eacute;mon needs an SOS battle may require a little bit of reading.</li><li> Veteran players already know that certain Pok&eacute;mon need exposure to a magnetic field to evolve and therefore need to level up in a specific area. However, the given area in these games is extremely counter-intuitive. One would guess the magnetic area is Blush Mountain, the area where the Geothermal Power Plant is located and some Electric-type Pok&eacute;mon like Elekid, Togedemaru and Charjabug can be found. Instead, the magnetic area is Vast Poni Canyon, which isn't related to electricity at all.</li><li> The stats judge is first seen as very sleepy and brushes you off for not showing him something remarkable. The solution to wake him up is to hatch more than 20 eggs, something that his dialogue doesn't suggest at all.</li><li> The locations of the Psychium Z and Flyinium Z. Psychium Z can be found in the Haina Desert after defeating Acerola's trial, a location well known for its confusing layout and the fact that after you conquer Acerola's trial the conflict with Team Skull <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the Aether Foundation</span> kicks off, leading many players to forget about the location until they go to hunt for Tapu Bulu in the postgame.

It's similar to Magikarp in a sense, though it's a form change rather than an evolution, and like Magikarp, the player has to deal with its weak attacking stats to get it to Lv 20. Its stat total is 175, the lowest in the series, but in its Schooling Form, it jumps up to a beastly 620, which is higher than most Legendaries.</li><li> While Grubbin and its evolved from, Charjabug, have decent enough stats, but its special attack is nothing compared to what it becomes as a Vikavolt. You're likely to get a Charjabug before you leave the first island, but it only evolves into Vikavolt at Vast Poni Canyon on the fourth island, one of the final areas of the game. You can mitigate this by giving it an Eviolite and heightening its already decent defenses, however.</li><li> The Mareanie line is this from the defensive side of things. As a Mareanie, its overall stats are pretty underwhelming, but once it evolves into a Toxapex, it will receive a <em>huge</em> boost in both its Defense and Special Defense stats (which is a flat 90 in each), turning it into a formidable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>.</li><li> Salandit is underwhelming, but Salazzle is quite fast and she has a great Special Attack stat. In order to make use of Salazzle though, you have to look for a female Salandit, but the Pok&eacute;mon's gender ratio of 8 to 1 means that you have a 12.5% chance of encountering a female one.</li><li> The Bounsweet line, like the Ralts-line beforehand, has quite mediocre stats, but upon fully evolving into Tsareena, all of its stats skyrocket.</li><li> Wimpod and Golisopod as well: Wimpod has poor stats except for Speed. Unlike Magikarp, Wimpod is capable of learning more than three offensive attacks, ensuring it isn't dead weight during training. However, Wimpod's only attacks by level up are Struggle Bug and Sand Attack, the former of which uses its inferior Special Attack (compared to its Attack), making leveling up without triggering Wimp Out or using TMs on it difficult. It's not so wimpy anymore once it evolves into Golisopod.</li><li> The ultimate example of this trope is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cosmog. Like Magikarp, it has the same pitiful overall stats of 200. At level 43, it evolves into Cosmoem, increasing both its Defense and Special Defense stats by 100 points, but at this point, it only knows Splash, Teleport, and Cosmic Power. However, all of this changes when it reaches level 53, where it evolves into Solgaleo (in <em>Sun</em>) or Lunala (in <em>Moon</em>), becoming a powerhouse as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Legendary Pok&eacute;mon</a> tend to be.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: While the names of the Tapu ruins are ironic in regards to their location, they do reflect the nature of their residents: the Ruins of Conflict is home to Tapu Koko, who likes to fight; the Ruins of Life is home to Tapu Lele, whose scales can cure people; the Ruins of Abundance is home to Tapu Bulu, who can help plants grow; and the Ruins of Hope is home to Tapu Fini, who inspires hope that it can heal people.<ul><li> Alternatively, others argue that the ruins are meant to be a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName">Ironic Names</a>. Tapu Koko lives in the Ruins of Conflict, but is seen fending off the Ultra Beasts (even if its intent was to just fight them) and rescues the player from falling, removing them from conflict. Tapu Lele lives in the Ruins of Life, but holds little regard for the living. Tapu Bulu lives in the Ruins of Abundance, but destroyed Tapu Village. The Ruins of Abundance are also in a desert, a very arid play. Finally, Tapu Fini lives in the Ruins of Hope, but because of the fog, it is essentially hopeless to track it down.</li><li> Elio and Selene (The protagonists of Sun and Moon)'s name come from the Greek gods Helios and Selene, the sun and moon god respectively.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>: The Aether Foundation is a corporation made to protect Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois">M&ecirc;l&eacute;e &agrave; Trois</a>: In a Battle Royal, four Trainers are pitted against each other at the same time with one Pok&eacute;mon out each, and they can target anyone on the field.

There are even some items that are replaced by this function- a Stoutland is the replacement for the Dowsing Machine from previous games, and Tauros replaces the Bikes.</li><li> Unlike most examples, this isn't a sweeping change but rather due to Alola culture prohibiting Pok&eacute;mon outside of Ride Pok&eacute;mon from using HM moves outside of battle, as the NPCs who give the TMs for Fly, Surf and Waterfall found out.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime">Rhymes on a Dime</a>: The two Team Skull Grunts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inhabiting Po Town's Pok&eacute;mon Center</span> speak like this.

Researching further, however, shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak">Game Freak</a> knew that this makes more sense than it seems, as Solgaleo is described as a "Beast that Devours the Sun." The main symbol of Alchemy is that of a lion that bites into the sun, hence not only being identical to Sogaleo's description, but Alchemy was the science of purifying <em>metal</em>. Hence the Steel typing.</li><li> The Z-Move activation poses appear to be based on hula dance steps. For instance, the Hydro Vortex pose is a common motion used to show large waves/turbulent water.</li><li> Pikipek's feet are zygodactyl (two toes in front, two in back), just like real life woodpeckers.</li><li> Yungoos' origins&mdash;it's not native to the islands, but was brought in to deal with the Rattata population. This backfired when the Rattata adapted and became nocturnal to avoid the diurnal Yungoos, and in the process Yungoos became an invasive species. In real life, mongooses were introduced to Hawaii to deal with rat populations and it backfired in a similar way; rats are nocturnal and mongooses are diurnal, so the two species never interacted.</li><li> The Alolan variants of certain Pok&eacute;mon are almost perfect representations of <em>real</em> evolution&mdash;they have changed gradually in response to environmental pressures. For example, Alolan Exeggutor gained a longer neck to take better advantage of the massive amounts of sunlight in the region, Alolan Marowak's danger sense was developed to give it an edge against omnipresent Grass-type predators, Alolan Sandshrew and Sandslash moved to snowy mountains because their traditional desert habitat was becoming more inhospitable from volcanic eruptions, and Vulpix avoided competition with other Pok&eacute;mon by migrating to colder regions, where they adapted to the cold.</li><li> In a much more sobering way, Team Skull's existence in a relatively rural Hawaii-based region (as opposed to an urban region like Unova) and struggles can be seen as a reference to Hawaii's massive (but little known by tourists) poverty crisis.</li><li> The uniforms of the Police Officer trainer class are fairly close to the real world police uniform worn by Hawaiian life enforcement.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippySlideyIceWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippySlideyIceWorld">Slippy-Slidey Ice World</a>: The peak of Mt.

A Pok&eacute;mon with lower health is more likely to call for help, so often they'll have a sliver of HP left for many turns before the right Pok&eacute;mon appears beside them, after which they're knocked out. Using an Adrenaline Orb makes wild Pok&eacute;mon nervous and more likely to call for help, as does facing them with a Pok&eacute;mon with Unnerve, Intimidate, or Pressure. Furthermore, some Pok&eacute;mon have predator-prey relationships with others, and the predator Pok&eacute;mon can be summoned by the prey. This can amount to the player deliberately keeping the prey in question alive but at low health so it will call for help, effectively being used as bait for their predators.</li><li> In Kiawe's trial, you can continue to get the answers wrong even though they're extremely obvious in order to keep fighting his Marowak and grind.</li><li> Sophocles' trial allows you to electrocute him repeatedly by deliberately picking the wrong answers.

His Yungoos obviously won't prove that much of a threat, but his Smeargle can easily wipe your party if you're underleveled. It has a move that counters your own starter Pok&eacute;mon, is pretty fast for that early in the game, and has Quick Attack to get off a free hit anyway. It doesn't help that Yungoos loves spamming Leer, which will make your Pok&eacute;mon even more vulnerable to those Quick Attacks. And Tapu Koko help you if you chose Popplio, as Leafage is a physical move&mdash;after a few Leers, Baby-Doll Eyes won't save it. Just ask several Nuzlocke trainers who ended the battle with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>.</li><li> Totem Gumshoos/Alolan Raticate, depending on the version. This fight can be a bit of a shock, especially if you're going in blind. This Pok&eacute;mon fight shows that this will not be any sort of ordinary Pok&eacute;mon Gym Battle of old, between the first usage of the Totem Power and will probably be the first Pok&eacute;mon to summon help.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22i2hm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22i2hm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22i2hm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The game does offer a concession in the form of a TM, which contains Brick Break, which both Gumshoos and especially Alolan Raticate are weak to.</span></li><li> Gladion, as far as both gameplay and plot goes, is one. He starts out as the typical bad guy of the type seen in these games - arrogant, rude, pushing your character off as insignificant - and his first Pok&eacute;mon is a typical Zubat. Then brings out his second, a previously unseen Mon: Type: Null. It has the same base stat total as a fully evolved starter Pok&eacute;mon, meaning you're facing a trainer with a Pok&eacute;mon with "fully evolved" stats before you even reach the second Trial. While it's not as tough as a typical Legendary, it's a very unsubtle foreshadowing.</li><li> And immediately following Gladion is the next trial's Totem Wishiwashi, which thanks to the Totem Pok&eacute;mon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a> is actually a credible threat. Unlike wild Wishiwashi, the Totem Wishiwashi's Schooling ability functions properly, pitting you against a behemoth that has well over 100 in all of its offense and defense stats in addition to the totem boost. Making it worse is that it can S.O.S. another Wishiwashi, which has Helping Hand, or Alomomola, which has Heal Pulse to <em>restore Totem Wishiwashi's HP</em> on top of Helping Hand and its own respectable bulk. You <em>will</em> need a Grass-type for this fight unless you're very overleveled.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">Walking Shirtless Scene</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Kukui</a>, who wears a lab coat with nothing underneath.

If you tell them you remember them from before, one of the Grunts admits he's impressed you recognized them because they both look identical. In Po Town, you come across two arguing female Grunts.
