This game saw Takahashi adopt a style of directing and writing that matched what most modern game developers view as the optimal strategy when in a game is in preproduction of creating mechanics then writing a story around them instead of the other way around as had been the case in <em>Xenogears</em> and <em>Xenosaga</em>, aka visions in this case, that is seen in his future projects resulting in vastly different narrative experiences from his older works. After much fighting from the fans, it was released in Europe on August 19th, 2011, and translated to English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. After much fan demand, the game reached American grounds in April of 2012. Unfortunately, due to the game's highly limited run, the original release became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">incredibly hard to find</a>, making it hard for fans late to the game to own the whole "set" of Wii <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, made up of this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory">The Last Story</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower">Pandora's Tower</a></em>.</p><p>On August 29th, 2014, a port for the New <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> system was announced, after Shulk's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUTU4OZrjzY">reveal trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">fourth</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> game.

They're split in 2 categories, Trials and Records, with the former largely relating to the various sidequests and latter being mostly combat based. Only the latter carry over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, possibly because the former are more tied to the overall story progress and the latter generally have further stretching goals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">Action Commands</a>: Burst affinity. Occasionally in battle the player gets the opportunity to press a button to increase the team's tension and affinity, without major consequences besides a minor tension loss should the player fail.

She remains out cold for four hours, and is even haunted by a nightmare right before waking up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>: During the majority of the dialogue cut scenes, the game uses pre-recorded animations and the lip movement is reduced to open-close-mouth. The characters' faces are rather motionless, the camera angles are pretty simple, and the shots are a little static. However, in the more dramatic and spectacular ones, the characters become more expressive, both in face animations and body language, the lip movement is animated accordingly to the spoken lines (at least with the Japanese dub), and the shots become way more dynamic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>:<ul><li> Most of the collectables are available via trades, which is great as some areas are unavailable after certain points, and a few collectables are hard to get due to randomness. Some enemy drops are also available via trades. Finding out who can trade for them when and where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">can be a chore</a>, though.</li><li> Fast travel and time changing. Easily saves dozens of hours of pointless wandering, and even with them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> still takes well in excess of 100 hours. Now if only they'd allow to change the <em>weather</em> too... and even that just takes a few time changes or fast travels.</li><li> Unlike most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG">Eastern RPGs</a>, there are no consumable healing items. Outside of battle, party members recover HP automatically, and during battle, all abilities (including healing) are tied to a cooldown instead of a mana system, so they can be used as long as you're willing to wait for them to recharge. This means the party will almost always be at full strength going into most fights, reducing the need to backtrack to a town to rest and restock on items.</li><li> Although the game is loaded with MMO-like quests to fetch items and kill monsters, many of them don't require you to return to the quest-giver to receive the reward, as it is given immediately upon fulfilling the objectives in most cases.</li><li> Shulk has no access to any weapons outside the Monado until the last few hours of the game. To compensate for this, the Monado's power scales to Shulk's level.</li><li> The Hidden Machina Village has the fewest amount of NPCs associated with it as well as the fewest quests. Their quests give out the most reputation out of all the other areas of the game in order to compensate for this fact.</li><li> If you visit every location and landmark on a given map, the rest of the map will automatically fill in.</li><li> In the Definitive Edition if you're playing Expert Mode and level down a character, they'll keep any Arts that they learn even if they're below the level they learned it.</li><li> The <em>Future Connected</em> epilogue can be played from the very beginning instead of having to complete the entire game first.</li><li> <em>Definitive Edition</em> highlights when arts have a special kind of interaction - such as any of Shulk or Riki's positional abilities, any of Reyn or Dunban's topple abilities, or Sharla's Head Shot. This is <em>very</em> helpful, <em>especially</em> for Shulk or Riki because it's a tad difficult to see when you're to the side or <em>behind</em> an enemy thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitboxDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitboxDissonance">Hitbox Dissonance</a>.</li><li> Compared to the Wii and 3DS versions, smaller enemies in the <em>Definitive Edition</em> can rotate <em>very</em> fast. If you fire off something such as Shulk's Back Slash or Riki's Sneaky before the animation fully finishes while enemies are rotating to face someone else, the game may still count these as if you hit them from behind even if it appears that they hit it from the side.</li><li> The new map system in <em>Definitive Edition</em> allows you to add markers to the map for future reference, prioritizes certain quests, and indicates whether the random collectibles on the field are quest-related.</li><li> The Noponstones obtained in <em>Definitive Edition's</em> Land of Challenge can be used to purchase a variety of items, such as cosmetic gear, equipment gems, and monster materials and collectible items. The last one in particular can help mitigate the grind for finding them in the field and relying solely on luck (slightly; the ones found in endgame areas cost quite the fortune in Noponstones).</li><li> In the original game, if an enemy is defeated while it's over a bottomless pit, the treasure chest it drops will fall into the abyss and become inaccessible. In <em>Definitive Edition</em>, enemies defeated in situations like this will instead have their chests spawn right on top of the lead character on solid ground.</li><li> The minimap added a tracking path, so you can always see how to get to the main quest objective.</li><li> Quests for orb drops are highlighted with an ! in the definitive edition, thus reducing some of the randomness hunting for them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Anti-Grinding</a>: Enemies with levels much lower than your party's give significantly reduced EXP, AP, and SP.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>: A freaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ApocalypseHow/ClassX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ApocalypseHow/ClassX4">Universal Class 4</a>! Klaus tried to get an experiment that would turn human beings into gods and he ended up destroying the entire universe except himself, Meyneth, and the computer AI's consciousness. After that, they create the universe of the game. Klaus, now calling himself Zanza, is turned into Bionis, Meyneth into Mechonis, and the computer's AI into the Monado's spirit, which can take the Homs form of Alvis.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNotKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNotKillApe">Ape Shall Not Kill Ape</a>: Shulk refuses to let Dunban kill Metal Face due to him actually being a Homs.

To prevent the player from wandering too far out, they will start to take damage as if swimming in poison water. An NPC mentions that the currents have high concentrations of Ether flowing through them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArborealAbode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArborealAbode">Arboreal Abode</a>: Frontier Village takes it to an extreme, being a 9-level borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LayeredMetropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LayeredMetropolis">Layered Metropolis</a> inside a gigantic hollow tree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>: <em>"Seize our destiny."</em> It starts as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catchphrase</a> for Dunban, but later becomes synonymous with the party's struggle to change the future.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: Shulk stops Dunban from killing Mumkar, not wanting Homs to kill other Homs. Dunban only relents after Shulk asks him what if he has to do the same to Fiora, giving him serious pause.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a>:<ul><li> Some enemies actually have counters to being knocked down that inflict damage back on you. The party member AI knows this - and they even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">cheat</a> in <em>your</em> favour, too! There is no way for <em>you</em> to know an enemy will inflict spike damage unless you inflict topple on an enemy. But if they <em>do</em> have a spike damage, your party members will not use their Break-Topple combos despite that they shouldn't know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. Similarly, they won't attack (not even with auto-attacks) if the enemy does spike damage and the party member's health is too low to survive suffering from Spike damage. Also, Reyn and Dunban are actually quite quick to use Topple on Mechon, as this is the only way to damage them reliably without Enchant.</li><li> Sharla's AI is pretty smart with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">Head Shot</a> &mdash; her AI is normally focused almost entirely on healing, which makes her a pretty effective healer, but the AI knows to usually reserve Head Shot for dazed enemies. Additionally, some of her abilities are more effective on flying enemies, yet also don't deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to Mechon because they're ether-based.</li><li> Reyn's AI is pretty good at tanking. And one reason people almost always use Riki is because Riki's AI does a <em>very</em> good job of keeping status debuffs on - his entire playstysle actually <em>relies</em> around this!</li><li> Fiora also has a few arts that rely on taking advantage of enemies that're suffering from conditions like Topple. Naturally, her AI is actually pretty good at saving these arts.</li><li> While Melia is considered to be the <em>stupidest</em> character in the game due to her playstyle being too complex for an AI to really handle, there's still Mind Blast. Her AI seems to know when she's fighting a Telethia and will try to enter Element Burst as <em>fast</em> as possible then instantly use Mind Blast. She's also somewhat smart with using Reflection, but most people think it's not worth putting on since it only works if she already has Aggro, which Melia simply should <em>not</em> have.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: That said, the AI still has a <em>lot</em> of issues...<ul><li> The AI does not handle positional abilities well. This leads to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">A.I.s</a> of Riki, Fiora, and Shulk (who all have abilities that are stronger if they're to the side or behind enemies) misusing their attacks when they're facing enemies or never making the effort to try flanking them. Usually they rely a <em>lot</em> on Reyn or Dunban to pull them off properly. It's one reason to ditch such arts for Riki and Fiora in favor of other arts their AI might be more effective with (Shulk is more or less stuck with the same palette of arts for the entire game).</li><li> Melia's AI is generally a bit too hard for a simple AI to handle. She almost always summons elementals for the status buffs - which is good, but what isn't good is when she walks right up to the enemy and summons them, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>. Moreover, while a player can notice (and use) the fact that you can summon one/two buffs, then continuously use the third buff as an attack, the AI will summon three in any random order before discharging them.</li><li> One reason why Shulk is pretty much <em>always</em> the player character is because many battles for a <em>huge</em> portion of the game are borderline impossible without the Monado... and Shulk's AI is too stupid to properly enchant<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11xkx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11xkx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11xkx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mechon-type enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> physical attacks and take half-damage from ether attacks, but Monado Enchant will allow your party to deal full damage. However, there are also Anti-Mechon weapons, which effectively have Enchant built in, but Shulk's AI refuses to check whether party members have these weapons before using Enchant.</span> or shield<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yzga');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2yzga" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yzga');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Shield will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">nullify</a> a single Talent Art used by an enemy, as long as Monado Shield is the same rank or higher, but it only blocks Talent arts. However, Shulk may use Shield for attacks that aren't Talent Arts, use Armor (reduces damage from all sources instead of nullifying an attack) instead of Shield for talent arts, use Shield for an art that's a higher level, or use a Monado Art too early and be unprepared when a vision appears</span>.</li><li> Riki simultaneously falls into this and brilliance - Riki is good at keeping on Poison, Chill, and Bleed, which are reliable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime">DoTs</a>, but he also has access to Burn, which damages even <em>faster</em> (and sometimes even <em>harder</em>) than Poison or Bleed. The problem? His Burn attack target groups of enemies, but his AI doesn't seem to realize that it's just as effective against single targets, meaning he has to be <em>ordered</em> to use Burninate against bulkier opponents in a Chain Attack.</li><li> Dunban seems to be adverse to using Blinding Blossom on Fiora in order to draw aggro away from her, even if she isn't using any sort of Tank equipment. He usually doesn't have much of a problem using it on other characters who happen to have uncomfortably high attention from monster attacks.</li><li> In the field, the AI can sometimes walk off edges and fall to their doom<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36164');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note36164" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36164');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">or you can push them off</a></span>... thankfully they respawn next to you within seconds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: The art style for the Definitive Edition leans more toward the anime aesthetic seen more prominently in the sequel.

On one hand, it can be rather cathartic to use one of the more hated enemy mechanics against the enemies and have a free damage increase for the party. On the other hand, it requires having your character take damage from the enemy; and in the late game and <em>especially</em> against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a>, that's a sign you're doing something wrong.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a>: Shulk surely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">doesn't take well</a> to the fact that Dickson, one of his mentor figures, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a>.

He can stack up some impressive status-effect damage as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">Gradual Grinder</a>, and he has the second-most HP out of all the party, only beaten by Reyn by just a few hundred at level 99.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a>: Shulk, who is a mid-ranking member of Colony 9's Defense Force's engineering division.

Even the Nopon party member kicks some serious ass.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">Bare Your Midriff</a>: Many characters have outfits that show navel, such as Fiora's and Sharla's default outfits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>: Shulk and Fiora; long-time childhood friends with romantic tones that are hell-bent on protecting each other in battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeakAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeakAttack">Beak Attack</a>: The Ansels are big flying birds with long and sharp-looking beaks. Their attack animation show them diving at the character, and their "Skewer" ability is rather self-explanatory.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulDreamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulDreamer">Beautiful Dreamer</a>: Twice. First, Shulk watches Fiora sleep when the Machina are about to fix her Mechon body. Later in the game, the roles are exchanged and Fiora is the one who watches over Shulk. Although this time, she's waiting for him to come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. In both cases, all characters have unique dialogue regarding them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">The Beautiful Elite</a>: Rather downplayed. Shulk, Fiora, Sharla, and Melia would be top model material in the real world (especially in a swimsuit). But Dunban, while still physically attractive, is within levels reachable by the average person; and Reyn would be unthinkable in most Japanese fantasy media. The NPCs' attractiveness varies a lot throughout the game, too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty Equals Goodness</a>: The good Faced-Mechon, Fiora, has good looks, has a general color scheme of white and gold, and has a design reminiscent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">KOS-MOS</a>. Mumkhar, the evil Faced-Mechon that pilots Metal Face has a generally-black color scheme, looks like a gonk, and is designed to look like a robotic assassin. Gadolt splits the difference. While his Face-Mechon follows Metal Face's design philosophy, bears a dark green color scheme and bears a single red eye on his actual face, he still maintains his good looks and seems to borrow a few elements from Face Nemesis as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehemothBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehemothBattle">Behemoth Battle</a>: The opening cutscene features a titanic clash between the the god-like entities Mechonis and Bionis. They are so big that after said battle, their still-standing corpses form the entire world in which the normal-sized characters live on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Beware the Nice Ones</a>: You would think Shulk, being a modest engineering student and nice guy, would not harm a fly. Or Fiora, a sweet girl and loving younger sister that takes care of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">Handicapped Badass</a> older brother, wouldn't be able to hurt anyone, right? WRONG!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">Beyond the Impossible</a>: Shulk's still able to have visions even when the Bionis Monado was taken away from him, electing this response from Disciple Dickson. It is later revealed it's because he had a third Monado tucked away in his heart which he eventually managed to manifest during the fight against Zanza, effectively making him a god as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: It changes through the story. At first the main conflict is with the murderous Metal Face. Then it changes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> Egil. And finally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGod">Evil God</a> Zanza shows himself as the real evil menace.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend">Big Bad Friend</a>: The true antagonist of the Black Market sidequest chain is Bana, one of Gadada's closest friends and the giver of one of the chain's prerequisite quests.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Big Creepy-Crawlies</a>:<ul><li> The Arachno/Antol and Caterpile enemies are the major ones. Wisp, Apis, and Fliers being a tad big but not even close to the size of the the Archnids and Caterpiles. Wisp and Fliers also tend to not be violent unlike the spider based enemies.</li><li> The giant Fortress-class Mechons are a robotic version, looking like a cross between a praying mantis and some kind of wacky Victorian exercise machine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>:<ul><li> Fiora pulls off one of these during the Mechon attack to Colony 9, involving driving a freaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> and fighiting single-handed against Metal Face, saving Shulk and co at the cost of her life.</li><li> When the party is surrounded by Metal Face and several Mechon, Dunban and Dickson show up to lend them a hand. When they are overwhelmed, a Telethia sent by Alvis makes a swift appearance, attacking the Mechon and making them retreat.</li><li> The party sans Melia infiltrates the High Entia Tomb just in time to save Melia from an assassin.</li><li> Reyn and Sharla get one on the Fallen Arm, showing up just in time to help Shulk defend a still-recovering Fiora from a Mechon patrol.</li><li> Shulk gets one at the last stand against the Telethia at Colony 6 after coming back from the dead.</li><li> Fiora has a couple of these with Meyneth, the most of which involve saving the party from a mobile Mechonis temporarily.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>: Nopon as a species have very little self-control when it comes to indulging in food and drink. One sidequest reveals all the residents of Frontier Village take their meals and snacks at exact, predetermined times, otherwise they'd all gorge themselves to <em>economic and societal collapse</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>: Lady Meyneth, the benevolent goddess of Mechonis, the one looking for a way to put an end to the source of the conflict between the Bionis and the Mechonis. Interestingly enough, this big good was indirectly assumed to be <em>the enemy</em> at first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a>: Shows up a few times, the earliest one being Shulk's reaction at Fiora's death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a>: Ether rifles can be BIG. Sharla is no small girl, but she's dwarfed by some of her guns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>: The Monado itself. It starts out almost as tall as Shulk is, and can grow to three times its normal size for special attacks. Dunban also has some BFSs of his own, which he wields <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander">one-handed</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a>: The characters that appear on the Monado's glass pane remain unchanged from the Japanese version - "machine", symbolizing that the blade will take apart Mechon, "person", given by Zanza at Prison Island, and finally "god", at the start of the ending sequence. Naturally, the characters don't know Japanese and thus can't exactly read them either; except Zanza, who audibly <em>freaks</em> when he sees the final kanji appear on the blade pointed against him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdPoopGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdPoopGag">Bird-Poop Gag</a>: Frontier Village is a giant tree with Nopon-ridden Pterixes (large Pterodactyls) constantly flying around it. When the player speaks to the unnamed Nopon npc's who walk on the outdoor balconies, several of them will mention that falling Pterix poo is just a fact of life in the village. One of them even stops mid-sentence, apparently having caught a dropping directly in the face as they were speaking to the player. Another mentions that he hears that Colony 9 has the same problem, but with 'Bionis' poo; likely referring to the falling debris that the AA canons shoot out of the sky regularly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: Highly sweet, mind you. Zanza is defeated, leaving the two gods finally at peace but destroyed, along with the world of Bionis and Mechonis. However, the universe is rebuilt, all the races of both the Bionis and Mechonis are saved from another destruction, Fiora gets her body back, and Shulk is finally at peace. However, many people, especially Machina and High Entia, lost their lives in the process.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagicianGirl">Black Magician Girl</a>: Melia, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> with some serious offensive ether arts on her arsenal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock">Blade Lock</a>:<ul><li> Dunban and Shulk of all people get into one during a cutscene. Shulk does not want Dunban to kill a fellow Homs, even if it is one he hates from the bottom of his heart.</li><li> The Bionis and Mechonis get into one after Zanza's reawakening, which ends with the latter's sword being broken.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass">Bodyguarding a Badass</a>:<ul><li> When Melia is introduced, she has a contingent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> bodyguards to help her track down a monster she's hunting. They all die in the fight, but she manages to beat it off and injure it with one big ether attack.</li><li> Likewise, much of Reyn's character development deals with him trying to keep his promise to protect Shulk, even as Shulk grows far more powerful than him. It gets even more building when Gadolt leaves Sharla in his capable hands before dying.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surf</a>: Zanza and Meyneth may have physical forms, but they still tend to take the bodies of others to show themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>:<ul><li> The game includes 5 bonus bosses whose levels are above the player's cap of 99. They are Final Marcus at 100, Ancient Daedala at 105, Despotic Arsene at 108, Blizzard Belgazas at 114, and Avalanche Abaasy at 120. The last one is especially nasty because he only spawns in snowstorms, meaning that in addition to being strong enough to rip apart even a maxed out party and being able to counter attacks with instant death if you don't use Monado Purge or certain gems, nightvision gems are a must to have any expectation of even touching him. To make things even worse, Avalanche Abaasy spawns in the same area as Final Marcus. If you're fighting Marcus and it suddenly changes to blizzard weather, you are likely in for a nasty turn of events.</li><li> A long sidequest chain leads to a boss battle against Bana, the Nopon kingpin; the only battle outside of the main story under the tune of "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCHt8Eaesyo">Tragic Decision<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>". Though it's not an overleved battle, it takes quite some effort to reach it, since the quests that lead to it cover almost half of the game and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>.</li><li> A special sidequest focusing on a mid-game boss climaxes in a battle against a Telethia who used to be First Consort Yumea.</li><li> Getting Colony 6 fixed up to 95% results in a bonus boss fight against a level 99 Demon King Dragonia, one of the three fightable dragons<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4hjqj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4hjqj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4hjqj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the strongest monster type</span> in the entire game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a>:<ul><li> Unique Monsters are super powered versions of otherwise regular monsters wandering around the world. They are usually, but not always, bigger than their counterparts, and are distinguishable by their fancy name tag and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">their unique names</a>. Fights against them can be even tougher than bosses.</li><li> Fortress-class Mechon are massive house-sized behemoths of a robot. Even in their non-unique forms, they can be even more powerful than Unique Monsters of the same level. And let's not even start with their unique varieties.</li><li> Many areas hold otherwise regular monsters that are several levels above the one of the usual monsters. Thankfully, most of them are usually found in some out-of-the-way areas, or don't attack unless provoked.</li><li> The Face clones, which are mass-produced versions of Xord. The unique monster variation in Central Factory is quite powerful, as it has topple spike damage unlike the regular Mass Produced Faces and it hits hard with its arts.</li><li> Dragons are also this; they're gigantic, most have spike damage, and some have Instant Death Attacks. Demon King Dragonia is fairly hard for a normal enemy, having more HP than a Unique Monster at the same level (Around 656,000), really powerful arts that can hit the entire party, and an Instant Death attack. It also gives the second best EXP out of any enemy, only beaten out by the Avalanche Abaasy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">which is the strongest enemy in the entire game</a>.</li><li> The Deinos Sauros within Makna Forest. They're the highest level monsters you can encounter pre-Mechonis Core event at level 98, meaning unless you're something like level 93, you'd have a tough time hitting it. Even so, it has only two different attacks: A powerful physical art that topples anyone who gets in its way and a level 10 talent art that guarantees instant death unless you either have debuff resistance<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5qu26');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5qu26" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5qu26');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">even then, the attack's quite deadly</span> or used Monado Shield. Also, the mere fact that the level cap's 99 means that the Deinos Sauros can never be below white when it comes to danger levels. Thus, it's impossible to fight it with its stats reduced to compensate for you being overleveled. They, therefore, give the most EXP, AP, and SP out of all the monsters in the game pre-Mechonis Core event. And let's not even get started on the Unique version, which is level 99, has a spike that topples you and it has over 2,000 attack power.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>: The Monado Dogma requires you to defeat either Avalance Abassy or Demon King Dragonia for one of its components. It's not much better than the other Monado Replicas you can obtain and it's strictly inferior to the Monado III, which you gain by simply finishing the main game and starting over on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>: Gadolt is one of the first Face Mechon to have their memories wiped in order to obey orders.

Approaching the wreck of Face Nemesis, he extracts Fiora from the Mechon's chest cavity and carries her to shore, leading into one of the most heartwarming scenes in the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: During the Nopon Black Market side quest chain, you have to give some writing to a certain NPC. At first, he thought it was an ancient Nopon dialect, until you give him some more writing from the writer of the previous writing. Then, he realizes that it's just bad writing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>: Dickson becomes one to Shulk over the course of the game. Ever since Dickson found him at Valak Mountain, Shulk has looked up to him as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>.

The Giants originally won the war and kept the powerful white spiders under control thanks to their Soothesayer. Eventually he died and the Spiders began to grow in power once again with no way to stop them. The Giants then resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Giant Sacrifice</a> in order to keep them under control. Which worked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">until their numbers dwindled</a> to the point that nothing they do could stop them.

In fact, the cap actually becomes a cliff beyond a certain point: the cap (1.5x EXP) applies to enemies who are 7-21 levels above you, but against enemies who are 22+ levels above you, you actually receive 'less' EXP the 'lower' your level is!</li><li> If you revisit Galahad Fortress after reaching the Fallen Arm, go to the level where you fought Fiora in Face Nemesis and Egil in Yaldabaoth and jump off the edge that the party fell off, you'll end up on the exact same beach where Shulk and Fiora reunite.</li><li> The game adjusts cutscene animations accordingly should Shulk be using a Monado other than the one he should have at that point (which is guaranteed to happen on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>). This is more obvious when on the Fallen Arm. If Shulk's using the Monado III (the only Monado whose inactive state doesn't involve its blade disappearing) up to this point, the Monado III is embedded downwards into the ground in a logical way during the cutscene that involves Shulk resting with Fiora.</li><li> If you wait until after Seven joins the party before doing the "biscuits for a grandson" sidequest, the only sidequest that pre-mechon Fiora has a unique comment on, Mechon Fiora will still have that unique comment, even though it is highly unlikely for the player to save such a small sidequest until that late, unless they are deliberately testing whether or not it will happen.</li><li> Even though the game encourages you to do the "Sunrise in the Park" Heart-to-Heart during your first visit to Outlook Park, you are not forced to do so.

However, after the events of Galahad Fortress the Heart-to-Heart will reappear in your log and you can take Shulk and Mechon-Fiora back to the park to view it. Interestingly, though, two lines of dialogue do change slightly without changing the meaning. Instead of saying "You had a big falling out..."

Also, if you want to go through it without having Shulk in your party twenty four seven, you'll be forced to downgrade to weapons that are weaker than the ones you already have and have only one slot, but can damage Mechon without Monado Enchant.

Players will only notice this if they talk to her multiple times in Frontier Village (there is no in-game reason to do so), talk to her again in Colony 6 (she sells nothing to the player, so there is, again, no in-game reason to do so) and recognize her distinctive speech patterns.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyExp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyExp">Easy Exp</a>: Finding new areas nets some generous experience; even more so if they are hidden areas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateEqualsEffective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateEqualsEffective">Elaborate Equals Effective</a>: The armors are bigger and bulkier the heavier they are.

When Shulk and Reyn come across the bodies of dead Homs, Shulk is the first one to suggest returning them to the Bionis. It seems innocent enough, but once you find out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> involving Shulk and the nature of the beings on Bionis, plus the fact that Shulk was shown to not be a religious person beforehand, this scene becomes yet more <em>incredibly</em> subtle foreshadowing to the major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist">Plot Twist</a> late game.</li><li> Right after killing Fiora, Metal Face shares a meaningful glance with Dunban, cluing the player in to Metal Face's identity as Mumkhar. Also of note is Metal Face's main weapon aside from that cannon on his back, his claws. Mumkhar also used claws as his main weapon. Subtle, yet easily noticed once you meet other unique faced Mechon and see that their weapon is based on what they used while they were still Homs.</li><li> When Sharla asks Othoron if Gadolt's alright, he replies that while Gadolt has disappeared, he can feel that Gadolt's still alive simply due to Othoron seeing Gadolt like his own son. While he is indeed right about him still being alive, he didn't know that Gadolt's ultimate fate was to be turned into a Faced Mechon.</li><li> After defeating Xord, he gives the first hints about his past as a Homs. The information is vague enough so the player doesn't know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">what this will lead into</a>. Speaking to a certain NPC in Colony 9 after his defeat reveals that a Homs named Xord used to be the best blacksmith in the colony. Think back to the weapon he used...</li><li> In the first encounter with Alvis, after showing Shulk how to use Monado Purge, he throws the Monado back at him and off-handedly states "The Monado doesn't wield itself. You wield it." While at first this seems just as a metaphor on how Shulk must learn to control the Monado's power, it's later revealed to be <strong>much</strong> more literal.</li><li> An easy-to-miss foreshadowing exists within Frontier Village where one of the NPC Nopons you can talk to states that he mustn't eat too much or else he would have to become Heropon to pay his debts. Similar to how Riki, the playable Nopon you encounter soon afterwards, became Heropon in the first place (an unskippable cutscene reveals that the only reason why he became Heropon was because he's in serious debt).</li><li> When Melia enters the High Entia Tomb, the "spirit" within speaks to her about Homs integration into the bloodline, and something about escaping a curse. Turns out that half-Homs High Entia are the only ones immune to regression into Telethia.</li><li> Easy to miss, since it's part of a sidequest, but a pureblood High Entia, who used to embrace Homs, Nopon, and hybrids, is now suddenly on board with the whole "pureblood High Entia are supreme" spiel and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> it involves. She claims this is the result of a voice she heard in a dream, which she believes was the voice of the Bionis itself. Now who, again, is the spirit of the Bionis, and refresh my memory here, what were they planning during the endgame?</li><li> When Zanza offers to release the Monado's true power, he says that, if he were allowed to release its power, "Only a god could stand in your way". Turns out, a god is <em>exactly</em> who intends to stand in Shulk's way.</li><li> Then about 2/3 of the way through the game, we get a dream sequence which sets up a big holy shit moment.</li><li> The fact that Shulk isn't very interested in food is the first clue that he's really a reanimated corpse.</li><li> Dickson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> early on ("Can't say I feel good deceiving these kids like this.") is a surprisingly subtle one. For one, it's your first clue that Dickson isn't as trustworthy as he seems. But further, the fact that he calls <em>everyone</em> in your party "kids", even Dunban, clues you in that he's older than he looks. <strong>Much</strong> older.</li><li> The fact that Lorithia makes a passing reference to the High Entia having yet to reach their true potential during their assault on Mechonis foreshadows their entire nature as Telethia being given sapience.</li><li> The fact that Zanza can only see up to the confrontation with Shulk and his friends after he obtains the Mechonis Monado foreshadows the fact that the Monado was only pretending to be on his side.</li><li> The fact that Alvis looked at Lorithia and Dickson in shock after their respective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">Inner Monologues</a> (concerning then not being as benevolent as they let on) as if he can read their minds is not only foreshadowing his loyalty to Zanza being fake, it also foreshadows him being the Monado's spirit as he's the only in-game character who's implied have the ability to read minds (besides the Telethia).</li><li> The lines Alvis said when he is revealed to be Zanza's disciple is deliberately worded so that it could either be interpreted as him taunting the party or him motivating them. The fact that he repeats it later on as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">Meaningful Echo</a> means that it's meant to be interpreted as the latter - the only reason why he deliberately worded it like that is so that the other disciple that was with him at the time, Disciple Dickson, as well as Zanza himself, for that matter, would not suspect Alvis' loyalty.</li><li> If you pay attention to the opening cutscene, you'll notice how the Mechonis is mostly moving <em>defensively</em> and doesn't strike any of the major areas on it where the beings of Bionis mostly live. Meanwhile, it's the <em>Bionis</em> that's mostly on the offense and is aiming most of its blows at the Mechonis head: AKA, where the Machina mainly live.</li><li> A <em>really</em> subtle one but the fact that Mechon are immune to most everything but the Monado or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyLikeCanCutLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyLikeCanCutLike">weapons made from Mechon armor</a> is a very subtle nod to the true nature of the Mechonis and Meyneth; being mostly defensive in trying to ensure the protection of her followers. After all, it was <em>Egil</em> who spearheaded the creation of offensive Mechon and programmed them to attack the Bionis.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble">Four-Temperament Ensemble</a><ul><li> The seven party members; Reyn (choleric), Sharla (choleric/melancholic), Shulk (melancholic), Melia (melancholic/phlegmatic), Dunban (phlegmatic), Fiora (phlegmatic/sanguine), and Riki (choleric/sanguine).</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and the disciples; Zanza (sanguine), Lorithia (choleric), Dickson (melancholic), and Alvis (phlegmatic).</li><li> The main Faced Mechons; Mysterious Face/Xord (sanguine), Metal Face/Mumkhar (choleric), Gold Face/Yaldabaoth/Egil (melancholic), Jade Face/Gadolt (phlegmatic), and Face Nemesis/Meyneth, while controlling Fiora's body (eclectic).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrictionlessIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrictionlessIce">Frictionless Ice</a>: While it's thankfully not used in any puzzles, any icy surface in Valak Mountain makes you move much faster than normal when you run on it: this can be abused by gathering speed on it and then jumping off it, causing you to be catapulted ridiculous distances. If you're really (un)lucky, you might even hit something mid-jump that the game considers to be ground, die mid-jump, and have the game fade away and return you to the last landmark before your body even has time to land. A few places even make intentional use of these ice physics to allow you to reach places you couldn't reach any other way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry">Friendly Rivalry</a>: You can cause the rivalry between several side characters to eventually evolve into this should you complete their quest chain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Event</a>: At the beginning of the game, before Reyn rejoins the party, go to the military district. Go to the fence where Jan stands and look through at the soldiers doing pushups for angering Square-tache. Note the gentleman on the left - easy to miss, but it would seem this is where Reyn ended up after coming back late from his break.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a>: How the Nopon are portrayed, at least in the English version. Their strange customs, funny accents, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle">butchered English</a> combine to create this impression. Crucially, many of the Nopon who have lived in Alcamoth their whole lives rather than in Frontier Village or elsewhere speak perfectly fluent English instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurBikini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurBikini">Fur Bikini</a>: The jungle-themed armors look like this when worn by the women.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes G to I&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing">Gainaxing</a>: Both Sharla and Vanea have some noticeable... bounce to them. It's very evident during cutscenes. This is toned down significantly in the <em>Definitive Edition</em> and is subtly applied to Mecha-Fiora too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>:<ul><li> Visions of the future play a key role in both story and gameplay, and new Monado Arts are often introduced in cutscenes (e.g. Purge, Speed), <em>not</em> to be forgotten 5 minutes later.</li><li> When Melia first joins Shulk and company, they don't realize she's a High Entia because her headwings are covered by her hat. To keep up the ploy, her headdress can't be removed or replaced until after the High Entia Tomb, long after her real heritage becomes known.</li><li> The best way to fight a Mechon if you don't have the Monado is to topple them over and then attack them. This technique is first seen in the very first cutscene, where three Defense Force soldiers topple a Mechon and proceed to stab its weak underbelly.</li><li> Shulk, Fiora, Reyn, and Dunban are from the same hometown and are close acquaintances, so they have very good synergy in combat with each other. All four are powerful physical attackers with access to topple and daze Arts, so they can either inflict heavy damage with Chain Attacks or immobilize enemies for a long period of time.</li><li> It's established earlier that the Monado can't hurt "the sentient beings of Bionis." Naturally, this doesn't come into play when fighting random monsters, but later you end up fighting some High Entia assassins, and if Shulk is in battle, the Monado will only do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to them. This is taken further within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> where the other type of Monados, including the Monado III, are indeed able to hurt them due to them not being limited in this regard as with the original Monado at this point within the story. This also applies to the Faced Mechon, once you know they are really just Homs in a forced symbiosis with a Mechon.</li><li> During cutscenes where the party will be fighting Mechon, you can sometimes see Shulk use Monado Enchant. While the Enchant status generally doesn't carry over to the battle, it conveniently explains why your party can damage normally unstoppable Mechon.</li><li> Some side quests and locations will be unavailable as the story progresses because their locations are either blocked and destroyed. if that happens, you will have to wait until the story is complete to go back and do them.</li><li> The fact that Shulk continues to have visions of the future after losing the Monado and getting it replaced by a shoddy knockoff may briefly <em>seem</em> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, but later it becomes clear that there's some significance to it. It makes sense after Shulk manifests the True Monado, which was apparently inside him the entire time.</li><li> If you see a location in a cutscene but haven't gone there yet, such as the test lab that Lorithia is shown in a couple times, 9 times out of 10 you can eventually go there.</li><li> Similarly to the above, if you see a party member using a new power that isn't one of their arts, such as Melia unleashing a wave of energy at the Telethia, or Shulk putting a barrier around Reyn while fighting the Arachno Queen, it isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>, they've just learned a new art!</li><li> Sometimes in Hear-to-Hearts, a character will mention that they do like something or don't like something. The collectibles that you gather throughout the game can also be gifted between party members. Guess how you figure out what gifts increase affinity and which ones decrease affinity?</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>:<ul><li> It is implied in the story that Riki is lazy and weak, and can barely scratch enemies, with the implication that he is only the Heropon as a punishment for being in heavy debt. In actual gameplay, Riki is just as capable as his partners, and he can even solo bosses.</li><li> Melia in a Frontier village cutscene doesn&#146;t believe Shulk when he tells her he can see the future, before this however she can be warned/warn other party members about visions during battle.</li><li> A side effect of having your characters' current equipment shown in cutscenes is that some dialogue regarding particular weapons (such as Dunban's anti-mechon sword) becomes nonsensical when that weapon isn't the one they're currently equipped with. This reaches its peak in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>: Dunban treats whatever sword he was equipped with in the last playthrough as the Monado, while Shulk talks about wanting to learn about the Monado when he has the Monado III. And then you reach the cutscene where Dunban drops the Monado and Shulk picks it up, and suddenly Dunban is carrying the Monado III so that Shulk can pick it up later and have it again to fight with it.</li><li> In the Mechonis Field, a cutscene shows that Gadolt's rifle is getting old and is starting to malfunction more often. Shulk offers Sharla to build her a new rifle, only for her to reject the offer and keep using it out of sentimental value... except that Gadolt's rifle has been long outdated as a piece of equipment by that point and while it's unsellable, you'll very likely have swapped it out for a better weapon a long time ago. In fact, as soon as the cutscene is over the gun is immediately replaced with whatever she had equipped, with no one taking notice. This is especially notable because most examples of this happening involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> shenanigans; this incident <em>will</em> happen through perfectly normal game progression.</li><li> Agniratha is heavily implied to be destroyed after you've finished all the story-related events within the city. However, it's still possible to visit it intact simply by taking the entrance through the Central Factory (if you haven't completed the Mechonis Core event, that is).</li><li> The Monado is supposed to be incapable of hurting sentient organic beings, but it can still damage species such as the hodes or kromars, seemingly sentient beings with their own, albeit simple, cultures.</li><li> It's possible to obtain a <em>second</em> "Gadolt's Rifle" if you managed to bring the first one with you for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. This, in spite of the fact that it's supposed to be unique due to the fact that it was once the rifle Gadolt used during the fight against the Mechon.</li><li> In the sidequests where you are delivering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> to the High Entia-turned-Telethia in Alcamoth, during the fighting, the party members are still cheering each other on, engaging in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a>, and celebrating at the end of the battles, despite the fact that these are meant to be grim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a> quests.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation">Gameplay Automation</a>: Auto-attack is the only form of normal attacking. Everything else requires input from the player.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">Genre-Busting</a>: The game has the look and feel of an eastern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role-Playing Game</a>, with a storyline to go with it. However, it contains several gameplay elements from western <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, with an overworld structured more like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> than anything else, a combat system inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, and a sidequest system with a quest log system. The UK voice acting even has more in common with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> than the voices usually used for eastern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">Get A Hold Of Yourself Man</a>: Sharla falls behind the group in Agniratha in a panic when she finds that Gadolt is gone. After trying to break free of his restraint, Reyn slaps her and reminds her that a Homs soldier like Gadolt wouldn't wait around to die.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a>: There are numerous monsters that are scaled-up versions of smaller ones. Most are Uniques, but there are a few actual mooks like the house-sized baboons in Satorl Marsh. The mantis-like Fortress Mechons all qualify, the smallest, mass-production ones being about two stories tall with a massive boss-class in the factory level that's at least four.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater">Grimy Water</a>: Mostly comes in poison swamp variety, but there's also some at the bottom of both Bionis and Mechonis in the form of ether-saturated water.

Giving one seemingly inconsequential item to an NPC early on could lead to a whole branch of later quests being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost</a>. Also, the game clearly points out to you which quests are timed, but never tells you <em>how long</em> you have until they expire. A timed quest could mean anything from that NPC moving to a different location later to an entire area being destroyed.</li><li> Some quests are completely unavailable to you until you talk to an NPC. An NPC you might have little to no reason to talk with.</li><li> It's minor, but knowing which NPC trades what requires either massive trial and error or a guide. Even worse, some items aren't offered up for trade until you reach a certain affinity with the area, and certain NPCs who move locations offer completely different items afterwards. Not to mention many of the High Entia you can trade with become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">inaccessible</a> after a certain event. Good luck completing the "Other" section of the Collectopaedia without a guide, whose items can <em>only</em> be obtained by trading with specific people. This is improved upon in Definitive Edition with the Affinity Chart showing what each NPC can trade, but moving <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs">NP Cs</a> and the Other Page is still difficult without a guide.</li><li> Good luck unlocking each party member's two extra skill trees without a guide, or even knowing that they have more than the default 3 skill trees in the first place. Unlocking each tree often requires the completion of several prerequisite quests, some of which may require that you first gain high affinity in the quest area.</li><li> If you want to gain affinity with areas, you have to do plenty of quests and talk to named NPCs after certain story event. If you don't do the latter, it's possible to lock yourself out of high affinity ratings later in the game. To make matters worse, sometimes it's necessary to talk to them as many as four times before you actually gain a reputation boost.</li><li> The fact that enemies are buffed or debuffed stat-wise depending on which danger level they are in (represented by the color of its enemy tag) and what level your characters are in comparison to the enemy you decided to fight. The game mentions via a tutorial message the danger level colors and what they represent, but it doesn't tell you the monsters gets buffed or debuffed depending on said colors.</li><li> The exact benefits (or hindrance) of each party member's tension (essentially the morale of each and every single party member participating in battle) are only detailed within game guides.</li><li> Maxing out your Party Members' Arts is a big one. Learning the intermediate levels is straightforward enough, just buy the books from shops; however, the Books that teach the Advanced Levels can only be obtained via drops from level 70+ monsters. The game never tells you this, let alone what monsters drop which Books.</li><li> Two of Shulk's Monado Arts, Monado Armor and Monado Eater, are not leaned by progressing through the story, and can only be leaned by raising a village affinity and completing several sidequests. The game never even hints at the idea that not all Monado Arts are given to you as the story progresses.</li><li> A missable special scene can occur just after the events of the Mechonis Core when the party first returns to Colony 6 and Shulk is unconscious in Linada's lab aboard the Junks. When Linada is not around (this can only take place at midnight), Melia can repeatedly speak to the unconscious Shulk for some dialogue regarding her feelings towards him, and also receive a big heart's worth of affinity (probably 300 affinity points like the big heart granting at the end of the Heart-to-Hearts). It appears that Melia was going to do something to the unconscious Shulk, perhaps a kiss, but she would later be ashamed had she not stopped herself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuysSmashGirlsShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuysSmashGirlsShoot">Guys Smash, Girls Shoot</a>: Played straight for all but one character.

When the party first arrives at the village, it's unclear if it's the same Nopon running day and night (they look similar, but have different dialog), but after Bana is outed as the kingpin in the Red Orb questline, Bana is sentenced to run the wheel day and night.

Their usually much greater ages compared to their Homs spouses don't seem to cause much issue as mentally they are often of similar maturity. The children they produce don't appear to suffer a decrease in lifespan or any particular defects either, though a majority of them can be identified by shorter head wings than pure-blooded High Entia (there are many exceptions who can't be distinguished visually from pure bloods).

The first exception and example of this trope is the High Entia race, who all speak in Upper Received Pronunciation accents and are the sole users of it. As a very long lived and somewhat isolationist society of High Elfish people, the language difference checks out.

The bonus is also based on the <em>average</em> level of your active party, so if the other party members are too strong, the bonus won't trigger.

Whenever it's possible, they build out of wood instead of metal or stone, prefer taming large animals over building vehicles, use bioluminescent pollen where most other species favor ether lamps. Even their "clocks" are large mushrooms that emit spores at regular intervals. It can go to damn impressive lengths: <em>Future Connected</em> introduces a Nopon ether gun.

For example, but using a combination of using sleep-inducing moves and moves with knockback, it's possible to push extremely high level enemies you normally wouldn't be able to even hit off of cliffs for a one-hit kill. Similarly, it's possible to use the high ground to your advantage to dodge enemy attacks that would easily kill you, this being pretty much required if you want to take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Fortress Units</a> in Sword Valley.<ul><li> A particularly memorable instance of this takes place when the party enters the Mechonis for the first time: at this point in the game, Melia will have just gotten her Starlight Kick technique (which inflicts Topple) and the area has a lot of flying enemies and walkways over bottomless pits.

Of course, the effectiveness of this strategy is reduced by the fact that A) Sharla's attack usually sucks, so you'll be doing this for an hour on light encounters and longer on others, B) it only really works on one monster at a time, C) some monsters have ranged arts that make this a non-option, and D) monsters of a higher level than her will dodge most of the shots, putting you in a stalemate. It still makes a surprisingly effective stalling technique, which is useful in a system where the player's abilities are balanced around cooldowns.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOverworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOverworld">The Overworld</a>: This game's overworld is utterly massive.

But despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">making sense</a> there are no highways for people to drive on, and swords and melee weapons are still used prominently.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFantasy">Science Fantasy</a>: The lands of Bionis and Mechonis make a serious mix of fantasy and science fiction elements. The very intro starts with an ancient battle between titans that then transitions to a battle between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalMonster">Mechanical Monsters</a>. The Monado itself is an ancient legendary sword that also happens to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blade</a>.

Et cetera.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>: Not only one of the main themes of the story, but one of the main gameplay mechanics as well. In battle, Shulk will get visions of lethal enemy attacks ahead of time, giving him a few precious seconds to kill the enemy, stop the attack, or defend against it, shattering that future.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretAIMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretAIMoves">Secret A.I.

But when the heroes discover that Metal Face is actually a Homs named Mumkhar piloting the robotic suit, Shulk decides to let him go, despite having a chance to kill him, saying that taking the life of a fellow Homs is wrong. Mumkhar takes this opportunity to fire a blast at them, but the blast misses and hits a spire that falls down, impaling him and pinning him to a falling platform, killing him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>: Two of them, actually. Dunban supports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Shulk and Fiora</a>, while Sharla roots for Shulk and Melia. The funny thing is that Sharla roots for Melia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">AFTER the party finds out that Fiora is</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>; and she eases down on it after finding how much Fiora and Shulk care for each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>:<ul><li> The game gives you an achievement for filling all of a character's upgrade slots with gems.

Furthermore, some overarching sidequests arcs progress alongside the main plot, and the connection between each of the individual quests involved becomes more obvious as they are completed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackBonus">Sidetrack Bonus</a>: The game rewards exploration via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonCombatEXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonCombatEXP">Non Combat Experience</a> for discovering new locations. Also, many areas hold stuff like unique monsters and surprise quests.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentWhisper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentWhisper">Silent Whisper</a>: Dunban gives one to Shulk early in the game.

Shulk/Reyn/Sharla is the first "real" team you have, and you have an entire dungeon to learn how to utilize them. The team provides the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a> trio which is very well-grounded and reliable. It is not unusual for players to stick with them throughout the story. However, players who are willing to experiment and complete side quests will find that other teams are much stronger, can combo much better with each other, and abuse the Topple mechanic much better.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>: This game leans toward idealism more than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> but it still has its fair share of cynicism and dark themes. Just ask the entire High Entia race or all of Mechonis inhabitants. Hell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">the entire freaking Universe</a> is completely destroyed BEFORE the plot even starts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfLinearityVsOpenness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfLinearityVsOpenness">Sliding Scale of Linearity vs. Openness</a>: The game follows a mostly linear narrative, but the game practically gives free reign on what to do and where to go. The general largeness of the environments and the huge amount of sidequests certainly help.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallGirlBigGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallGirlBigGun">Small Girl, Big Gun</a>: Sharla may not be a small girl, per se, but her guns are pretty damn huge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">The Smart Guy</a>: Surprisingly, all main characters have traits of this to different degrees (Even Reyn and Riki have their moments). However, Dunban would be the closest one to play the role straight, followed by Shulk. And he only falls behind due to his lack of experience.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">Soundtrack Dissonance</a>: Done for a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">Mundane Made Awesome</a> effect. The fight against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Bana the Nopon Kingpin, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a>, is done to the tune of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadBattleMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadBattleMusic">Sad Battle Music</a> "Tragic Decision".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a>: Not only is the gradual falling damage from falling too high which can and will kill you negated by landing in deep water, you also get an ingame achievement for doing so for the first time. It's also outright invoked by an NPC rather than just being a gameplay mechanic, and even factors into the story (with various Homs that survive falling from Sword Valley and are rescued from the sea by Machina). Basically it's part of the physics of the Xenoblade world that deep water is always soft enough to land in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheGear">So Long, and Thanks for All the Gear</a>:<ul><li> When Fiora gets killed, she keeps whatever she had equipped for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> while any gems equipped are automatically removed from her equipment. Since her early equipment is quickly outclassed and her weapons can't be equipped by anybody else, it's not a big issue.</li><li> Melia is a partial example, in that she <em>does</em> permanently join the party at some point (and thus you can <em>eventually</em> recover anything you gave her), but there are a few stretches during Makna Forest and Alcamoth where her equipment is not available from the party screen, which can make it annoying when following a quest or two without her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>: To <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em>, and to a greater extent, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>. <em>Xenogears</em> and <em>Xenoblade</em> both take place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> worlds where space was once explored, and of course one (out of two) gods are evil. The two also share more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expies</a> and other story elements.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI">Spiteful A.I.</a>: The Nebula enemies have high physical defense, making them hard to kill, and when they get weak, they explode.

Admittedly, Fiora's robot body probably has something built-in to hold her daggers, and Riki has a backpack of some sort... but it's clearly way too small to hold his weapon without it falling off so he might as well still fit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeSyntaxSpeaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeSyntaxSpeaker">Strange-Syntax Speaker</a>: The Nopon accent gives off the illusion that the Nopon folk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle">are not really fluent in the language of the Homs</a> (when they actually are), with them tending to refer themselves as their given name when talking to others, them tending to add "pom" to the end of certain nouns, them calling the Homs "Hom homs", etc. An unnamed Nopon NPC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshades</a> this by making up a theory on the spot as to why they speak like that when you go talk to her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AStormIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AStormIsComing">A Storm Is Coming</a>: Zanza says this nearly word for word after the events of Prison Island.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>: The game can pretty much be split into five arcs: the Xord arc, the Prison Island arc, the Mumkhar arc, the Egil arc, and the Zanza arc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryToGameplayRatio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryToGameplayRatio">Story-to-Gameplay Ratio</a>: Director <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Although in the end, the game still has its share of long cutscenes, the longest having a combined total of <em>ten minutes</em> where the average length is less than three minutes. The ratio is balanced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">dramatically</a> increasing the amount of exploration and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternRPG">Western-RPG</a>-like sidequests.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubtitlesAreSuperfluous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubtitlesAreSuperfluous">Subtitles Are Superfluous</a>: Battle dialogues don't have subtitles, so people who don't speak either Japanese (most people) or English (a lot of people outside the US and the UK) will be left out during those.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">Suicidal Overconfidence</a>:<ul><li> Unique Monsters attack no matter how powerful the party is.</li><li> The player-controlled party leader sometimes displays this if a sufficiently tough monster is targeted for attack.

In this form, they are big, bulky and have access to some powerful attacks, but it comes at the cost of much intelligence and sentience, making them fully subservient to Zanza.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>: The Monado. It's the legendary sword said to have been wielded by the Bionis in the battle against Mechonis, and it's a big part of the plot, its presence being involved in several events.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOverHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOverHead">Sword over Head</a>: Shulk does this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Egil</a> after his boss battle, hesitating to kill him even as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zanza</a> is screaming in his head and telling him to do it. In the end, Shulk refuses to take Egil's life and sits down to have a chat with him.

Even in those moments, it's perfectly fine to go back to Colony 9 and keep doing sidequests.<ul><li> There are a couple of moments where the game locks out your ability to skip travel to keep you on task (most notably around the High Entia Tomb sequence), but this seems to have more to do with a heavy reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags">Event Flags</a> than any desire to railroad the player.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfPower">A Taste of Power</a>:<ul><li> For the tutorial, the players takes control of some characters whose levels are in their twenties before the main game gives the obligatory level one characters.</li><li> Later in the early game Dunban rejoins with Shulk and Reyn wielding the Monado during the attack on Colony 9, and he is likely to be a much higher level than both of them. However, this is only for a few minutes before Shulk picks up the Monado and starts wielding it himself, though Dunban still sticks with the party a little while after that.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: The Gogol types within Bionis Leg, not counting Unique Monsters, are all named after four of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a>, while both of the normal Gogol types encountered of Satorl Marsh are named after demons.

Not only do they work on just about everything, even bosses, but there are at least <em>four</em> separate damage-over-time effects (Bleed, Poison, Blaze and Chill), and they all stack with each other. Riki can take major advantage of this, stacking all four on enemies quickly and re-applying them when they wear off ad-infinitum, to the point where he's considered one of the best boss killers in the game. The other main status effects, Break/Topple/Daze, render enemies not immune (and only flying monsters generally are) completely immobile and vulnerable to damage, and at higher levels the party can spam these to make sure they never have a chance to get up.</li><li> On the other hand, the same status effects are only mild annoyances when used by enemies: damage-over-time effects are easily out-healed, and active party members can snap each other out of Sleep, Topple or Daze (though an attack that renders this on the entire party can be problematic). Moreover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Sharla</a>'s status-curing ability actually has the additional effect of making the target <em>immune</em> to further debuffing for a short while, (and she can hit your whole party with it later) making them all the more useless.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild">Undead Child</a>: Shulk died and was reanimated at the age of four.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a>: Egil and Shulk play right into Zanza's hands for the majority of the game.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes V to Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder7" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">Variable Mix</a>: The theme song to Colony 6 becomes much livelier the more you restore it, eventually culminating in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriumphantReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriumphantReprise">Triumphant Reprise</a> of Colony 6's own theme.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>: Prison Island, the second time around.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycle</a>: Every time the Bionis races grow advanced enough to travel into space and leave him to die, Zanza enacts the apocalypse to reset everything.

Shulk's role is relatively minor and the other protagonists get passing mentions. This is exemplified at the start of the game as Melia is chosen to be the group's leader by default rather than Shulk.

The collectopedia also unlocks a cute swimsuit for Melia that has pathetic stats.<ul><li> One of your rewards for beating the campaign is being able to freely switch the appearance of Shulk's Monado.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: Teelan, who was originally a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a> and a sidequest character in the base game, becomes a supporting character in the main story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">Badass Creed</a>: The Ponspectors have a short but strong one that all 12 will chant in unison during their Chain Attack:<div class="indent"> <em>We measure! Find treasure! Ponspectors 'til we die!</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>:<ul><li> The Fog King is the one for the main storyline. It kills most of those living in Alcamoth and forces them to move into the now very overpopulated town of Gran Dell.</li><li> Bana takes this role for the Gran Dell sidequests, as it's revealed that almost every problem that the villagers have had since moving there were caused by him trying to develop addictive drugs to become emperor of the Bionis Shoulder via a criminal empire. He arrived shortly before Melia and friends did with the intention of taking advantage of the chaos caused by the Fog King.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">Big Bad Wannabe</a>: Gael'gar is seemingly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for the main storyline, with him being shown right from the start, being the end to Melia's entire character arc while being quickly shown to be extremely deluded and hypocritical with him aiming to rule the remaining High Entia when he realizes Melia does not plan to lead them the way he wants her to (namely as a divine progenitor figure who demonizes their ancestors and idolizes half bloods), but he fails at killing Teelan and killing Melia. In the end, he never even gets close to the final goal he seeks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">commits suicide</a>, as the real main antagonist The Fog King starts to terrorise the Bionis Shoulder. Further, Melia and the rest of the group never treat Gael'gar as a major threat so much as a pitiable and seriously deluded man whose vileness all the same cannot be excused by whatever traumas he suffered as a half breed High Entia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>: While there are no enemies above the level cap, there are two enemies stronger than the Fog King that function as this, being Contemptous Greymane, a Level 78 Gogol Fog Beast that can summon reinforcements (and being a Fog Beast those enemies are stronger than normal), and Prosecutor Davrum, a Dragon enemy with a powerful spike, which can only be unlocked through getting all 12 Ponspectors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>: Once again, the final sidequest has the party fight Bana and his mount to the theme of Tragic Decision.<ul><li> In the main game, Melia is healed by Sharla while in a coma. In this game, Sharla's stand in does the same thing.</li><li> This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">isn't the first time</a> a Nopon has said "meh meh" a lot. Bonus points for Nene considering she's also a tank.</li><li> A Heart-to-Heart from the main game has Riki talk about one of his littlepon who became afraid to climb trees after a bad experience. A quest near Gran Dell reveals that Nene was that littlepon, and just like Riki promised in the original Heart-to-Heart, he helped her overcome her fear.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture">Call to Agriculture</a>: Most of High-Entia and Machina living in Gran Dell have become farmers and ranchers, adapting well to the more rural lifestyle. For the most part they enjoy it, but the main goal is returning to Alcamoth for all of them, as they would still prefer to choose where they live rather than be forced to stay there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory">Coming-of-Age Story</a>: The half of the story that is not focused on Melia is devoted to telling this for Nene and Kino. It's also arguably this for Melia, or at least the conclusion of one that began in the main game as she grows into her role as Empress of Alcamoth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Cool Sword</a>: Shulk's Monado Replica EX (in universe shortened to Monado REX), which he later upgrades into the Monado Replica EX+, which is able to cut through the Fog King like butter and has four burners shooting out of its side.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>: Melia regularly summons four or five elementals with a wave of her staff, which is quite the far cry from her usual "only three and summoned one at a time" limits. It does make for cooler action, though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>: Alcamoth's minimap has been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from the main game, so relying on the minimap will get you disoriented.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>: Tyrea. She gets better. Several of the more traumatized NPCs also qualify, though most of them also get better.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>:<ul><li> Gael'gar after being defeated once more in his sidequest jumps off the floating island when he realizes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> dream of a racist holy half-High Entia empire will never come to pass.</li><li> Tyrea nearly reached this point in the backstory, but met Teelan during her attempt and kept on living.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a>: Downplayed with Bana. While the citizens of Gran Dell said they'll work with him to improve the town and forget about his drug dealing and stealing, they also punish him by making him do community service running food to the militia. The High-Entia girl who was Bana's main victim alongside her also addicted boyfriend believe this is too light of a sentence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>: Downplayed somewhat: the main conflict on the Shoulder, aside from the Fog King, is flaring racial tension. After the Alcamoth refugees failed to retake their capital with heavy losses, a comment by the Machina leader was taken the wrong way and caused the resentment over the Mechon war to explode, until a good chunk of Gran Dell's High Entia population seceded and founded the Companions on the other side of the island. It's downplayed in that aside from Gael'gar the raging supremacist, most of them are good people at heart (as Melia points out, the fact that they peacefully exiled themselves instead of trying to throw the Machina out speaks volumes) and they eventually reconcile when forced to join forces by the Fog Beast attacks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">Floating Continent</a>: The Bionis Shoulder remained in position flying above the clouds after the rest of the body was destroyed due to an absurd amount of Hoverstone concentrated in the ground. Shulk theorizes that due to the Giants' ruins there that the floating islands in Eryth Sea and Alcamoth were constructed by Giants mining it from the Shoulder and moving it to other parts of the Bionis.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>: With Zanza gone, the Telethia have become quite docile, to the point where no Telethia are fought at all in <em>Future Connected</em>. They even aid the party several times in the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a>: Several NPCs are involved in one or were at one time:<ul><li> Winnie had one in the past, but lost her full blooded High Entia husband when he turned into a Telethia during the Bionis' resurrection. The experience made her a emotional wreck. She's also currently being pursued by a smitten Machina and a half-High Entia, though she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>.</li><li> Another Homs woman also mentions losing her High-Entia husband to the Telethia transformation.</li><li> There's a Homs chef who once lived in Alcamoth with a one sided crush on Tyrea.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a>: Melia actively refuses to reveal herself as Empress, believing that the last thing the population needs right now is a shockwave in the political sphere. Maxis, leader of the Companions, is shocked to learn that among unusually powerful wanderers who regularly helped them is actually the rightful leader of his people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>: The Fog King has qualities similar to the Gnosis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em>, being unable to be damaged at first and seemingly coming from another dimension entirely. It's ultimately defeated in a way that resembles the Hilbert Effect, with Shulk overclocking the Monodo REX to induce an Ether field that makes the Fog King tangible and thus able to be damaged by conventional weaponry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>: Taken to the next level. As in Xenoblade tradition, the Bionis Shoulder is gorgeous. However because it is the only real area in the epilogue, it's absolutely huge compared to the areas in the main game and many parts of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em>, being very similar to the size of areas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>. Because of the increased draw distance and verticality of the area, vast stretches of the floating island can be gazed out at from many locations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a>: Bana has continued his criminal activity by moving to Gran Dell and changing his name to Bama. Shulk and Melia recognize him right away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>: The truth behind the Fog King is never revealed, though Melia believes it is a bad omen of things to come.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Token Human</a>: Token Homs rather. Shulk is the only Homs member this time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">The Unreveal</a>: The true natures of the Fog King and the rift are not explained. The only possible hints to their origins is that Zanza's theme plays for the first phase of the final boss, and that it somewhat resembles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">the Infernal Guldo</a>.</li></ul></div><hr><div class="indent"><strong>Shulk:</strong> Cool!
