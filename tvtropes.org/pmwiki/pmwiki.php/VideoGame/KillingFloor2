As more of the workers at Horzine Labs started seeing things not being completely okay, Kevin did the only thing he could do before it was shut down: Use himself as a test subject. Cue the Killing Floor 1 Objective mode update that expanded a bit on the story, concluding that Kevin's own daughter wanted to put an end to the Zeds and that Kevin cloned himself. Oh and the team takes a train to Paris. Cue sequel.</span> Okay, well, you're sent in to kill lots of freak cloning specimens, get money, buy better guns, survive to kill the boss, rinse and repeat until the game goes gold and possibly gets a plot-point like the last game. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0k8zv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0k8zv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0k8zv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Nope!</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RareGuns/Handguns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RareGuns/Handguns">AF2011</a> was thought to be a fictional gun due to its weird design, a conjoined Colt 1911 lookalike. It is a real gun, although obviously it hasn't seen widespread use.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>: As of the 2017 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode">Summer Sideshow</a> event, Weekly Outbreaks are available which can earn you exclusive cosmetic items, as well as a separate set of sideshow tickets that when collected in sufficient number can be exchanged for themed cosmetics. The later Halloween Horrors update that same year, alongside its own set of Halloween tickets, introduced a new dosh vault that players can earn money for by completing certain objectives, including the weekly objectives. Filling it up past certain intervals rewards special loot crates that can be opened for free and contain exclusive cosmetic items.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: Pretty much abandons the slasher film aesthetic, replaced with a predominantly sci-fi look, with later maps introducing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> look.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">Attack Its Weak Point</a>: Some of the zeds have designated weak points other than their heads, including the fleshpound's glowing chest plate, Hans Volter's power core on his back and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">the Husk's backpack</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">The All-Seeing A.I.</a>: There are plenty of dark places on some maps (especially Catacombs) and your options for lighting them up are severely limited and often ineffectual. What lights there are tend to get broken quickly, especially with a Demolitionist on the team. Naturally, the Zeds have perfect night vision at all times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysNight">Always Night</a>: Almost every map is either set at night or indoors with almost no natural light sources available. The only exceptions are Outpost, which appears to be set during <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night">polar twilight<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; Black Forest, which <em>starts</em> at dusk, then switches to night in the midpoint of the mission; Nuked, wherein the exact time is unknown, though the sun is at least barely visible either setting or rising through the dust of its namesake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear detonations</a>; The Descent, where the opening area of the first wave, at least, takes place in daylight before the player moves on to different darkened indoor areas for later waves; and Zed Landing, one of the few maps to completely take place in daylight. As of the Treacherous Skies update, the Airship map was added, which takes place on the deck of a flying machine during a midday rainstorm. This trend was continued in the Back and Kickin Brass update, with the Steam Fortress map being set in what appears to be either early morning or sunset.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmmoUsingMeleeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmmoUsingMeleeWeapon">Ammo Using Melee Weapon</a>:<ul><li> The Pulverizer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">sledgehammer</a> with a magazine of explosives feeding into it. Using heavy attack will detonate one on impact, adding a shaped explosion to the actual swing. If the magazine is empty, only the actual hit will do damage. The light attack, jab, and block don't use ammunition.</li><li> The Eviscerator is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">Swiss Army Weapon</a> that launches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDisc">spinning circular blades</a>, but also has a larger circular saw mounted in front. The projectile discs are loaded from a magazine, while the front saw uses a tank full of fuel to spin, rapidly doing damage to whatever is in front of you. Jabbing and blocking likewise use neither ammunition.</li><li> The Hemoclobber is a futuristic looking bat with needles sticking out on one side, that functions similarily to the Pulverizer, just with healing gas instead of explosives. Its heavy attack will release healing gas on a hit, poisoning zeds and healing any nearby players. It can also heal players with the primary attack which does not use up ammo, albeit only one at a time or if they're near each other. It has less ammo compared to its counterpart, being able to load 3 healing charges per clip and with 12 charges to spare.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom">Amusement Park of Doom</a>: The first Summer Sideshow limited time event added a new map called The Tragic Kingdom which is set in a giant abandoned amusement park. The map has tons of special features including minigames, ride based traps and hazards that players can set off, new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">Circus of Fear</a> themed skins for all of the Zeds (including bosses) and prize tickets players can exchange for new cosmetic items.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: Due to Tripwire taking things into account, a lot of things have been added to ease issues:<ul><li> You don't need to be alive to get the achievement for completing a map, nor do you need to complete it on 10 waves.</li><li> When you die and respawn, you're either compensated with an amount of money proportional to progress through the mission, or you get to keep how much you had before dying, whichever one is higher.</li><li> Similarly, if you join a game that has been in progress for a few waves, you'll find yourself with a larger amount of starting dosh. You'll still need help from your teammates to fully kit yourself out, but it won't require them to sacrifice nearly as much of their own funds.</li><li> Each class has a class-starting weapon even without any experience with that class (compared to the first game requiring high levels in a perk to spawn with weapons), lessening the issue of getting a gun from the get-go that revolves around your perk.</li><li> The Healing Dart hitbox is double the size of the player model for injured players. The darts will actually home in on other players, and all medic weapons will have an audio cue for when the dart is locked on to a player. Updates made it so that the darts fly through the air faster as well.</li><li> A button was made specifically for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickMelee">Quick Melee</a> bash, leaving you less defenseless than previously, especially during reloads. However, it interrupts a reload, so use it wisely or you'll die bashing zeds instead of shooting them and living on. It will get clots to let go, which is good if you're grabbed while trying to reload on the run.</li><li> Wave-completion rewards increase on higher difficulties.</li><li> A minor one, but you can now vote to skip the trader so you won't have several seconds of downtime before the next wave.</li><li> Perks were remade to fit a better leveling structure - you don't need to specifically play as a perk to gain experience with it, and you also gain experience for that perk just by using weapons associated with it - making leveling up more of a frequent thing, allowing for leveling perks without actually playing them, and made each perk get skills every 5 levels that players can swap between when they need to between waves. A later update also allowed for more explicit cross-class abilities, such as getting Commando bonuses while using the Medic's assault rifle, or Sharpshooter getting lesser versions of the bonuses for pistols and revolvers that its Gunslinger offshoot can get. It does retain a hint of the old "requirements" leveling by giving you increased XP for specific perk-related actions: the Commando still gets XP bonuses for killing stalkers, the Support still gains experience for welding doors, the Demolitionist can get more experience by killing Fleshpounds with explosive weapons, etc. However, you're not <em>required</em> to do these while playing as those perks to level them as in the first game, thus also not screwed out of experience when someone else invariably kills your target on accident - they're just a bonus you can get any time you have the appropriate weapon on-hand.</li><li> You're no longer stopped dead in your tracks when you receive melee damage from enemies. Instead, this was re-worked into clots and its siblings grabbing hold of you, with the game pointing you into the direction of what exact enemy grabbed you. This can be a disadvantage at times, however, as it forces you to prioritize weaker specimens regardless of your situation (though sometimes you can get lucky and nail an accidental headshot on the enemy in question just due to the camera naturally pointing your gun directly at it); a later update added an option to toggle this behavior on or off depending on whether you appreciate it or find it annoying.</li><li> The maps have multiple respawn points, unlike the first game where everyone always spawned at one specific point. The respawn point used for between-wave player spawning will be within a short sprint's distance from the trader.</li><li> Increasing difficulty will raise the smaller Zeds' numbers, damage, speed, aggression, and variety of attacks, but they don't gain additional HP at any difficulty level above Hard. The devs specified this was to mitigate the frustration of leveling up to more powerful weapons but having them be less effective because you're playing on harder difficulties. Similarly, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">Dynamic Difficulty</a> system can increase the game's pace, but won't make enemies more durable or numerous, so you don't have to worry about running out of ammunition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">because you started out doing too well</a>.</li><li> Unlike the first game (and earlier versions of <em>2</em>), everyone has a body-mounted flashlight instead of just a few weapons having mounted flashlights, so players no longer need to choose between the right tool for the job or something lesser to be able to see.</li><li> If Zed Time starts when no Zeds are around any players, everyone can move at normal speed until someone attacks or comes into range of an enemy. Zed Time also slightly speeds up reloads and weapon switching (with some perks also getting skills that let you reload even faster during it), so if you have to do either, the Zed Time won't be <em>completely</em> wasted.</li><li> Weapons lower on the tier tend to start out with more ammunition than ones that are more powerful, and are cheaper to refill as well. They can also be upgraded farther than higher-tier weapons, as of the update that added that ability, and often get noticeably better performance boosts for it (for instance, before it got a nerf the Gunslinger's starting 1858 revolver could be upgraded to deal almost as much damage as the top-tier .500 Magnum).</li><li> Reloads can be interrupted at any time, unlike in the first game where, at best, weapons had one or two specific points before the animation finished that would let you interrupt by switching weapons. This is a mixed blessing, but is generally seen as more of an advantage than a disadvantage, with some weapons allowing for noticeable amounts of time to be shaved off of reloads because of how early in the animation the player's ammo counter actually updates, as well as allowing players to easily cancel out of badly-timed reloads if you're, say, trying to top up a still-half-full weapon and suddenly get ambushed by a pack of Crawlers.</li><li> The final handful of zeds in a wave are marked on the heads up display if they are not in line of sight. This is especially helpful when a zed is stuck in a spawning vent, circumventing the need to locate them using only their audio cues.</li><li> Each zed also has a hidden "rage mode" which is activated after a certain amount of time has passed or when only a few zeds are left. It makes all zeds faster and more aggressive, so they're more likely to run into you and get gunned down rather than hide away and force everyone to hunt them down.</li><li> Unlocked skills that are so useful that everyone uses them, but aren't considered overpowered, generally end up patched to be innate abilities of the class. Examples include the Berserker's immunity to being grabbed by clots, Demolitionist and Support's supplying teammates with grenades and ammo, and Commandos sharing their sight of cloaked Zeds. Conversely, the same also sometimes happens for skills that are simple, useful in some circumstances, but completely outclassed by a much better skill they compete against at the same level, like the Demolitionist's ability to set welded doors to explode when Zeds break them down, which is a neat niche ability but was nowhere near useful enough to be worth using over the ability to prevent Sirens from making your weapons harmless.</li><li> While playing solo, a self-heal restores 50 hit points rather than the 20 it does in multiplayer. This compensates for missing out on the more powerful healing only available in multiplayer (Field Medic weapons and the halved cooldown from using a healing syringe on someone else).</li><li> The achievements for collecting items across levels used to require finding <em>all</em> of the items, of which there was something like 30. A later update lowered this to just ten, allowing quite a bit of leeway for exploration without having to waste a lot of time ignoring one or two enemies to find everything. Some later maps have even been designed with only ten collectibles in them, though maps where the player goes past a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a> between waves, like The Descent (where it's a straight shot between areas), Nightmare &amp; Biolapse (where the waves between the beginning and end are completely randomized), and Krampus' Lair (another straight shot that changes every three waves) still have the full thirty to try and alleviate the possibility of a player missing just one collectible in an area and promptly screwing themselves out of getting the achievement in that run.</li><li> Weapons added from crossovers and events (like the Zweih&auml;nder, available to those who own <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChivalryMedievalWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChivalryMedievalWarfare">Chivalry: Medieval Warfare</a></em>) or through DLC (like the Glock and riot shield combo), can be purchased in the pod by anyone in the match if at least one of the players owns the prerequisite games or has unlocked the weapon in question. And even if that player leaves, their shared content will remain available for the rest of the match. In the case of the MKb42, at least, shortly after it was introduced as a reward for completing the 2018 Halloween seasonal objectives it was added to the regular inventory, though the unique skin also unlocked remained exclusive to those who completed the objectives.</li><li> During the Transport objective on many of the game's objective maps, the player carrying the datapad gets slowed down, making them dependent on teammates to protect them. This does not apply in solo matches or if the player in question is the last one alive, to reduce the time needed to travel to the drop-off point.</li><li> When random objectives to defend an area in the map for extra dosh were first added, players were required to keep themselves within the objective area and zeds out of it for the entire wave to get the reward. It was annoying for several reasons, including its tendency to trigger at <em>every</em> wave, and the inconvenient placement of the defended areas; if they weren't set in areas that are difficult to keep zeds out of for an entire wave, then they were placed at the exact opposite side of the map from where the trader opened up, often forcing players to miss out on some of the possible reward because the objective counted as being abandoned before anyone even got into it. A later update turned everything around: the objective triggers much less frequently (with greater rewards for them in turn), and your reward now ticks up from zero as you kill zeds while standing in the defended area, with the objective being counted as cleared and letting you move to a more convenient area once you've gotten the maximum reward the wave allows.</li><li> Falling damage and other ambient sources of damage are negated while the trader pod is open between waves, to facilitate taking shortcuts to the pod that would damage you in normal gameplay.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumRange">Arbitrary Minimum Range</a>: If the M79, RPG-7, or Seeker Six hit something less than about 10 meters away, the explosive won't detonate,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lteu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1lteu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lteu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is realistic for grenade launchers, but not so with the RPG-7, whose original-issue ammunition uses a contact detonator that does not have a minimum-range safety feature</span> though the impact itself still does some damage.

It's as powerful as you think, but it weighs <em>12 units</em> (most high-end primary weapons weigh 9-11 units, enough to equip a second primary weapon, but this limits you to a secondary at best), reload speed is worse than the rail gun (and is also a one-round clip, but with no auto-aim), and every single bullet costs <em>50 dosh.</em> You need to be skilled and well-supported to line up efficient shots, as these things <em>don't</em> take out heavy enemies in one hit, or just save it for the boss and hope it's a big target.</li><li> Infernal Insurrection 2020 introduces a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">minigun</a></em>.

While not as terrible as other Zeds, their bodies can, and will, walk around with their heads partially (or completely) removed.</li><li> Cysts, which look very... "<em>hollow</em>", have empty black holes for mouths and eyes, and look just... horrifying. They're underdeveloped versions of the Clots. They're incredibly weak, and fall over if they miss an attack.</li><li> Slashers are basically batshit-insane Clots. They have claws, they slash at you, jump at you, lunge at you, and have spikes popping out of almost every part of their body, something of a cross between a Clot and a Crawler. They move erratically (including the occasional somersault) that makes it hard to land a headshot on them.</li></ul></li><li> Gorefasts seem much more bloody and meaty, still missing their lower jaw, their non-blade arms have been removed from the shoulder and the arm 'holding' the blade just has it jammed halfway through, leaving the hand and lower arm completely bisected. Gorefiends are both better and worse, as they've been allowed to keep their left arm... but they've got <em>another</em> blade jammed through that one. They also seem to be missing their lower jaws, leaving their unnaturally-long black tongues to hang out.</li><li> Crawlers look less like they've been strapped into leather BDSM gear and instead have clumpy hair everywhere and random vestigial spider legs that twitch around as well as extra eyes.</li><li> Husks' bodies glow as if their fire-tank is lighting fire inside of them. This is more or less confirmed if you take a Husk's head off, as the neck stump will occasionally spew fire. They'll also occasionally just blow up, usually from a kill-shot that hits the tank on the back (which damages nearby Zeds), but sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">intentionally</a> to try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">take you down as well</a>.</li><li> Sirens have gotten what seems to be a sonar-machine jammed into their throats and their jaws broken, explaining their ability to scream people to death.

You can occasionally find a free one lying around, which will be useful even off-perk, because it can quickly dispatch common Zeds without using more valuable ammo until its runs dry, then be sold for 100 dosh.</li><li> The Double-barreled Boomstick, the Support's next-cheapest weapon available, is far more spectacular than that fact would imply - the full damage of all of its pellets are guaranteed to remove the head of any zed save for the largest two, even those two will be staggered for a bit after eating its pellets, <em>and</em> the kick on the gun when firing both barrels with alt-fire will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoilBoost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoilBoost">knock you backwards</a> to keep you away from zed retaliation.

It works like a slightly less hefty version of the fire axe from the first game.</li><li> The Medic's starting weapon is a pistol that is slightly weaker than the 9mm (but still strong enough to kill common Zeds with 1 headshot), has more than double the reserve ammunition, and weighs 1 block. It also makes healing darts available for you from the beginning of the game. Even if you aren't a Medic (and already <em>have</em> a Medic), it's good to keep everyone healed, especially on higher difficulties, where even one Medic can't keep everyone healed.</li><li> The Commando's starting weapon is not the Bullpup, a much favored gun (it has been replaced with a higher-tier, full-size rifle that does better damage), but the 9mm Varmint Rifle, a slightly less powerful submachine gun, with burst fire or single fire settings, which makes it more like an oversized pistol due to its small mag and lack of auto-fire. It does just fine getting you through early waves where all but one of the zeds that spawn can be killed in one headshot. Like the pump shotgun, you'll occasionally find one lying around, which is good for off-class use as a faster substitute for the pistol that kills common zeds in one headshot, then can be sold for an extra hundred dosh towards a better gun.</li><li> The Gunslinger's M1911 pistols are basically the 9mm handguns, but with extra firepower in exchange for about half the magazine capacity. Still cost-effective and easy to use against smaller targets even as an off-perk weapon; in the hands of a gunslinger they will clear crowds of weaker zeds in seconds with good aim and recoil compensation.</li><li> Although it had a rocky start (it seemed it took the entire shot just to kill <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">one</a></em> basic Clot), thanks to buffs, the starting HX25 Grenade Pistol for the Demolitions perk can take down 4-5 weaker Zeds at once in earlier waves, is cheap to buy both itself and ammo for it, and the best part: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage">whereas the M79 and RPG-7 can cause self-harm if you're too close to the explosion</a> and have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumRange">Arbitrary Minimum Range</a> before their projectiles will actually detonate, the HX25 will detonate even on a zed that's grabbed you, and deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">no self-damage whatsoever</a>.

This has been mitigated somewhat by the introduction of the long-awaited Sharpshooter class, which is capable of powerful headshots and can stun even large zeds long enough to finish them off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a>: Mr. Foster's popularity made him one of the first two characters from the first game to be playable in the second, pretty much solidifying him as the face of <em>Killing Floor</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">Break Out the Museum Piece</a>: Among the selection of modern weaponry available are such things like an old-west lever-action rifle, black powder revolvers, a pre-WWI shotgun, and a Vietnam War-era light machine gun. Hans Volter's primary weapons are also a pair of old MKb-42(H)s from midway through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, which he will gleefully point out while shredding you from long range with them ("Old man, old guns!").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">The Bus Came Back</a>: Ringmaster Lockheart from Summer Sideshow 2013 of the first game returns in Summer Sideshow 2018 of the sequel, having been trapped on the airship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">he used to get away from Steamland</a> with specimens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a>: Zed Time. Not only does it slow down time, it increases the contrast and adds a slight monochrome effect, making it easier to see in the dark at the cost of blinding you in the light or if you're using night vision. All perks's maximum level bonuses are two choices to make things even more awesome for them while in Zed Time, such as being able to reload in real-time or causing zeds to explode and poison other nearby zeds when you kill them during it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp">Call a Hit Point a "Smeerp"</a>: Money was renamed into "<em>Dosh</em>". That's not even just what the characters or fanbase call it - the money icon on the HUD isn't any real currency symbol, but a modified "D" that's open at the bottom and has two horizontal lines through its stem, similar to the symbol for the Euro.

The class has been slightly re-balanced to support a couple of guns to make the Berserker less reliant on "running face first into danger and die" tactics. Can throw EMP grenades that will leave zeds doing little more than walking and swinging (rather than, say, Husks burning the team). They have natural damage resistance and, depending on the skills chosen, can regenerate health or near-double their maximum health to become the tank.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackofAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackofAllStats">The Commando</a>: Focuses on hitting enemies at mostly any range and dealing a good amount of damage, making them quite able at taking out trash mobs, special threats such as Stalkers or Husks, and even the giant zeds with headshots. Can see Zed health and cloaked stalkers that are close enough, and reset Zed time up to 6 times at maximum level to provide his team a bunch of leeway to annihilate the Zeds in slow-motion. Throws normal HE grenades.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">The Support</a>: Focuses on dealing huge amounts of damage on multiple targets, and making sure big armored threats, like Scrakes and Fleshpounds, die quick at close-range. They're also good at welding doors (and are the only class that can repair destroyed doors) and can, well, support other players by carrying an ammo pack that their allies can get ammo from once every round. They can throw frag grenades that have a weaker explosion but will shoot out shrapnel that will bounce like pinballs in enclosed areas for greater effectiveness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">The Medic</a>: One of the two re-balanced perks, adding Medic-based guns for almost each weapon category, giving Medical versions of pistols, SMGs, shotguns and automatic rifles. They're less potent then their proper brethren, but hold more ammo and can fire healing darts to keep the rest of the team at full strength. Also gains gas grenades that heal teammates and poison zeds. Their regular healing syringe also recharges faster than any other class.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">The Firebug</a>: Focuses on setting things on fire to deal damage over time, and lighting up dark areas. Most of their weapons create a radius of fire if fired at the ground, allowing both your teammates to see better in the dark, and to set zeds that walk through it ablaze. Throws <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovCocktail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovCocktail">Molotov Cocktails</a>... which, of course, also light the ground and stuff on fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">The Demolitionist</a>: Focuses on utilizing explosives to deal massive damage. Every single one of their weapons save their melee is explosive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback">Rather limited when things get closer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">since most of their weapons will damage themselves then</a>. Can throw extremely potent sticks of dynamite as grenades which explode on contact, they can turn any door into an explosive deathtrap, and they themselves release an explosion instead of dying the first time they're reduced to zero health each wave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">The Gunslinger</a>: An offshoot of the Sharpshooter that focuses on single and dual-wielding pistols and revolvers to take out zeds with headshots. Similarly to the Commando, the Gunslinger is quite versatile and able to handle a variety of things easily from a variety of ranges. Throws a nail bomb that is similar to the Support's frag grenade that instead does mostly piercing damage from bouncing shrapnel and is liable to stun Zeds for a short duration, just a bit less than the SWAT's flashbang.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">The Sharpshooter</a>: The original Sharpshooter perk is back, only he's given his pistols to the Gunslinger and now only uses rifles and the old crossbow. The lever-action rifle, a Winchester, is much as it's ever been, and his starting weapon at all skill levels, with a later update also adding a higher-tier version with more modern furniture, including a short-range scope. The crossbow has lost its perfect aim (but does increased damage and causes Zeds to stumble almost every time), so the go-to weapon is now the M14 EBR, much unloved in the first game but improved with an ACOG scope. He's also traded his M99 in for the much lighter rail gun (which includes an aim-assist mode with reduced damage). Instead of blowing up, his grenades freeze surrounding zeds for a few seconds, doing only minimal damage but allowing easy headshots and making stalkers visible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">The SWAT</a>: Small guns with large magazines and fast rates of fire, the SWAT specializes in hosing down zeds with bullets and keeping large targets at bay. Currently, the SWAT can focus either on buffing his armor limit and durability in order to get in the face of large targets, or enhancing his own mobility and disrupting the mobility of targets with increased stumble and slowing down targets with continuous fire. The SWAT carries a flashbang grenade that puts targets into a stunned state and kills small targets at the site of the explosion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Survivalist</a>: Has no weapons to itself (except the Freezethrower, Killerwatt and HRG Arc Generator, added in late 2017, early 2019 and late 2020 respectively), instead they get increase damage with <em>any</em> weapon, but not quite as much as dedicated perks. Unlocks allow minor specialization, for instance increasing reload speeds for about one half of the weapons or the other, extra space for ammo or more room for weapons, replacing their grenades with other sorts of grenades (e.g., the Medic grenade), and the like. This allows for extremely versatile weapon combinations to fill several roles at once, but most players would prefer that you use a specialist. Mainly used for picking up the weapons of dead teammates and utilizing them with partial synchronization.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">Charged Attack</a>: With the Husk Cannon, you can hold the trigger to charge a more powerful shot. The Killerwatt's alt-fire also lets you charge up a powerful shot that, in addition to dealing damage, electrocutes any zeds in it's path and gives the same effects as the Berserker's EMP grenade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a>: A couple of selectable skills in each perk invoke this: Carry around more ammo or carry around an ammo bag your teammates can use.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectionSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectionSidequest">Collection Sidequest</a>: Every map has hidden items that players have to find and shoot to collect, usually Dosh pendants but sometimes something unique, like purple baby-ish things in Black Forest, puppets in Farmhouse, or beachballs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Alan Wilson's face on them</a> in Zed Landing.

Healing darts generate a puff of blue vapor, and medic grenades emit blue smoke. Even the medic's scalpel melee has a glowing neon blue handle. Updates have added a visual component to the zed-time healing area effect; if you leave zed time before it finishes, you'll see that it is also blue.</li><li> Fleshpounds glow yellow when calm, red when raging.

His aim with his guns, on the other hand, sometimes goes through the level geometry, as well as being on point, <em>every damn time</em>.</li><li> It was once possible to join a server as a spectator and spectate Hans in first person. Doing so showed his view was somewhat rigid, as if his view was being moved around with a controller thumbstick, as in it takes a short moment for him to turn around or go around a corner. But as soon as he pulls his guns out, his view would instantly snap between targets at rapid speed, regardless of his world animations. Explains why he would be facing away from you shooting at a teammate, and you would get nailed with a bullet or two without him even turning around.</li><li> For reasons unknown, bullets fired by Hans would somehow open any closed door, preventing you shutting one behind you to take cover from his fire or buy time. This was a big problem if he shot a door open from behind you, then tossed a very deadly gas grenade ahead of you, boxing you in between him and the gas when the grenade should have bounced of a door that should have been shut. This has been mitigated in later patches, and now the only attacks that will open closed doors are explosions.</li><li> Originally, Zeds could teleport ahead of you. This was most noticeable near the end of a wave, when there are only a few zeds left; people frequently run around the map looking for extra weapons to sell for cash &mdash; or even just try to get to the trader before killing the last zed, to get more time at the trader (especially important on large maps). You could run away from a zed, turn a corner and run directly into him again. Some areas could be temporarily blocked at both ends <em>by a single zed</em>.</li><li> In spite of this, it is still possible to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV1bx5JxWWE">create a map with stuck zeds<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The mind boggles.</li><li> A patch released shortly after the "Bullseye" update made it so zeds could only teleport if they had gotten stuck or had no way of reaching the player otherwise, but this for the most part has removed their tendency to teleport ahead of you in favor for a tendency to teleport <em>behind</em> you, often seeming to do so less than five feet away when you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack">looking in another direction</a>.</li><li> In the first beta of the 2018 Summer Sideshow update, E.D.A.R Trappers had the ability to ignore level geometry with their lasers, which made them able to stop players dead in their tracks even if they physically shouldn't have been able to. This was patched out with the 2nd beta, which also reduced the range of the laser.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsALyingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsALyingBastard">The Computer Is a Lying Bastard</a>: Some of the weapon and skill descriptions are inaccurate, either because they are outdated or describe features that haven't been implemented yet.<ul><li> The alt-fire on the AA12 toggles between semi-automatic and fully-automatic, but the description used to say it's automatic only. This was eventually corrected.</li><li> Likewise, the MP5's description used to say its fire mods are semi-auto and full-auto, but it's actually full-auto and three-round burst. Again, this was also corrected.</li><li> The Commando's stat listing claimed every fifth level will increase Zed time extension by one second, to a maximum of six. The way it actually works is that getting a kill during Zed time causes the three-second timer to <em>reset</em>, and what increases is the limit on consecutive extensions that that Commando can cause (any other perk can only do the first reset). This was eventually rectified in the 2019 Summer Sideshow update, where the stats now list said passive as <em>Zed Time Refreshes</em>.</li><li> The Demolitionist's "Extra Rounds" skill claims to increase the maximum ammo for explosive weapons by 5. It does so... so long as the explosive weapon in question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">isn't C4</a>. For some reason, until like the above the description was updated with the 2019 Summer Sideshow event, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">there was no mention whatsoever before trying the skill out that C4 is exempt</a>.

Since almost all enemies use melee attack exclusively, this makes it a lot easier for them to hurt you, lowering your speed even more. This is one reason armor is so important: it takes most of the damage instead of your health, and losing it <em>doesn't</em> slow you down. Likewise, health lost above the standard 100 does not cause speed loss, making skills that boost maximum health even more useful than they initially appear.</li><li> Killing enemies just slightly slower than they come in can lead to a few strays sneaking up behind you to body-block or even grab you. This often slows and distracts you enough that a swarm will catch up to you and surround you, continuously pouring in faster than you can hope to handle (especially if you have to reload).

The biggest things to understand are that you get a different attack depending on the directional arrow you're holding and that blocking with precise timing will actually <em>parry</em> attacks (if the weapon is strong enough compared to the enemy), negating all damage and stunning the enemy briefly.

The Berserker, post-starter weapon, can cash in a surprising amount of dosh, one-hit kill almost any specimen, as well as resist a ton of damage.

All projectile weapons receive less recoil if you aim down the sights or stay still, though some of them fire slow enough that it doesn't really matter. The Sharpshooter in particular can choose to get extra damage while stationary (level 5, "Sniper") and even more damage while crouching (level 10, "Stability") when using on-perk weapons.

Based on the premise, the sequel is set one month after the previous episode, with the outbreak of Zed clones spreading from London and the UK to continental Europe.

Later official maps (set for example in a tropical island, a nightmare world, or hell itself) however tend to heavily deviate from this premise, but no one cares.

Much like regular bloats, he also drops a whole lot of gas and bile puddles that deal damage, making it hard to take him down, while also having to watch out for his zed spawns and his gas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Knife Nut</a>: Every single perk has it's own knives, they all work the same but all are very visually unique.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFoley">Kung-Foley</a>: Every melee weapon makes audible "wooshing" sounds with every swing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KukrisAreKool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KukrisAreKool">Kukris Are Kool</a>: The Sharpshooter's unique melee weapon is a kukri.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateToThePunchline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateToThePunchline">Late to the Punchline</a>: Characters' lines in response to the environment don't change in reaction to what they themselves are doing or equipped with, hence things such as Classic Masterson noting that he misses his old night-vision goggles from when he was in the military while <em>having</em> NVGs as a Commando, or players deliberately breaking lights, only for their character to then complain about how dark everything is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LagCancel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LagCancel">Lag Cancel</a>: Like many other shooters, the full animation for reloading can be canceled after the current ammo counter for your weapon goes to full by switching back to the same or a different weapon, or pressing the bash button.

Possibly the prime example would be the Firebug perk. At level 1, your fire damage is rather weak. You are able to spread a lot of it around, but it isn't good for much besides softening up zeds for others to come in and clean up. However, once you hit level 15, your damage against basically everything besides Scrakes and Fleshpounds will <em>skyrocket</em>. You can get 35% more damage with fire at level 5, you can create ground fires which cause heavy damage and slow zeds at level 10, and at level 15 you get an ability that makes it so zeds hurt and set each other on fire whenever they touch each other while on fire. Since they tend to huddle together in groups, they will damage each other rapidly.

They can also be disabled by hitting yourself with an EMP grenade. Classic!Masterson will occasionally make mention of these as well, lamenting when in the dark that he misses the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/PVS-7">"PVS-7"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> he had in the military.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBulkDiscounts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBulkDiscounts">No Bulk Discounts</a>: Played straight with all weapons and ammunition, except C4, which was initially a bizarre, probably-accidental aversion. You buy a detonator and get it fully stocked with C4, and can sell it back for 75% of what you paid even if you've detonated all the explosives (because ammunition supply doesn't affect sell-back cost). You could then buy C4 again, effectively letting you refill your stock for 1/4 of the weapon price (rounded up). Since C4 costs 650 dosh and refilling it originally cost 100 dosh per explosives, this is a discount when buying any more than one explosive. This was pretty minor for off-perk use because you only get two explosives, but a Demolitionist gets between three and <em>seven</em> explosives depending on level, so one could effectively get C4 for <em>half</em> the price of grenades despite doing more than twice the damage. Later updates eventually fixed this, with as of 2020 it costing 300 dosh to buy the weapon and selling for 225, and the maximum number of charges you can carry is increased by one (so three normally and eight with a fully-leveled Demolitionist) but you only get two when buying the weapon rather than a full set and it costs 50 dosh per charge - enough that it's only a discount to sell and rebuy the weapon if you're completely out of charges.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoisyGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoisyGuns">Noisy Guns</a>: Pick up or equip any weapon. It will click and clink and rattle like it's about to fall apart, especially when you reload with a full magazine and your character does a 'fiddle' animation.

They also explode when the tank on their back is shot and/or hit enough times or on occasions where they're decapitated while charging, which does <em>not</em> harm the player at all. This leads to the bizarre instance of charging Husks blowing up in a player's face due to a lucky shot and leaving them completely unharmed, and other times where the Husk makes itself blow up in exactly the same fashion and the player is either heavily wounded or completely dead on higher difficulties.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">Non-Indicative Name</a>: The Commando's starting weapon is called a "Varmint Rifle", but visibly uses handgun rounds, which technically makes it a submachine gun (specifically a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_9mm_SMG">Colt 9mm SMG<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). It's been effectively retconned into being a 5.56x45mm assault rifle (doing the same damage as the SA80 and Stoner 63A and only benefiting from the Commando perk, not SWAT), regardless of what the model shows.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem">No Plot?

And really, it doesn't matter; just kill zeds.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">No Swastikas</a>: Hans Volter's manor contains golden Nazi Reichsadler, but the swastika has been replaced with the iron cross. The presence of the Black Sun symbol, commonly associated with Neo-Nazi groups, should also be noted. In the earlier concepts, Volter clearly wore swastika armbands.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumbersStations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumbersStations">Numbers Stations</a>: In the official map "Farmhouse", there is a radio in the basement that plays a repeating sequence of numbers in Czech.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a>: As in the first game, Zeds can spawn in thin air or teleport to spawn points if players aren't looking at them or their potential destination. However, the game also adds some limits on this: just being within 10 meters of a Zed is equivalent to looking at them, teleportation cannot happen until some time after line-of-sight is broken, and the largest types of Zeds (Bloats, Husks, Scrakes, Fleshpounds, and bosses) cannot ever teleport. Even when they aren't teleporting, though, all off-screen Zeds move at a fixed speed that's faster than most Zeds' on-onscreen sprinting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">One Bullet Clips</a>: Played straight in the same manner as the first game, but there are now multiple different reloading animations for any one weapon to tacitly explain it. Reloading before the magazine is emptied has the player character grabbing a new magazine and swapping it out with the old one in one quick motion before tucking away the old mag, while reloading from empty has them drop the old mag, attach a new one, and then chamber the first round of the new one. A skill available for most perks, most often called "Tactical Reload", offers alternate animations to speed up the reloads, like using the slide release lever or bolt-catch button instead of pulling back the slide or handle for empty reloads. Attempting to reload when the gun is still full plays one of the idle animations, in which the player character double-checks that the mag is full, performs a brass-check to ensure a round is in the chamber, examines the weapon itself, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunTwirling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunTwirling">shows off</a>. And, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothingReloads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothingReloads">unlike the first game</a>, all of these are interruptible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">Painfully Slow Projectile</a>: All projectiles have travel time during Zed Time, and some have at all times. Most go at 100-200 m/s, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">faster than most examples</a> (and a perfectly realistic speed for grenade and rocket launchers), but bullets still only fly at a fraction of their real life speed. Since handguns and rifles are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">hitscan</a> weapons normally, going into Zed Time can actually make it <em>harder</em> to hit the target. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Conversely</a>, almost everyone can throw grenades at <strong>50</strong> m/s (major league fastballs are usually only 40) and the fastest projectile in the game is a crossbow bolt (which goes <em>three times</em> as fast as a handgun round).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintTheTownRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintTheTownRed">Paint the Town Red</a>: One of the main features of the game is the ability to completely dismember enemies and splatter the walls and floor with their blood and guts. Bodies and severed limbs will eventually disappear so as not to break the game, but blood stays between rounds all the way to the end. Even on a short 4 wave game there will be enough blood spilled for the players to bathe in by the time the boss goes down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PajamaCladHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PajamaCladHero">Pajama-Clad Hero</a>: Completing all of the side missions on the Krampus Lair map during the 2017 Twisted Christmas event rewards players with festive pajamas (complete with bunny slippers) to wear during their next bloody killing spree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a>: The "HRG" weapons tend to just be existing weapons given a new white and blue color scheme, typically firing a different projectile than its base. The "HRG Buckshot" revolver (based on the .500 Magnum), at the very least, does also cut down the barrel to about half its base's size, but others don't even go that far, like the HRG Winterbite based on the Spitfire, which goes as far as still having a(n albeit blue-colored) pilot light around the muzzle, despite its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce">different ammo type</a> simply not needing one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay">Play Every Day</a>:<ul><li> There are daily objective to complete that give vault dosh when completed, which goes towards unlocking special crates.</li><li> Weekly Outbreaks are games of fixed length and difficulty that modify the game in different ways, like Zeds exploding when they die or shrinking when they're damaged.

Note though that the devs typically respond to this and fix things in some manner, however:<ul><li> The Berserker's Vampire skill restores 4 HP for every kill. Even by itself, this is only mildly useful, requiring large amounts of Zeds that are weak enough to be killed quickly without damaging you in return for it to outpace just relying on the 20 health every 15 seconds from your own syringe. However, it absolutely paled in comparison to its alternate ability, Fortitude, which increased maximum health by 75% (very useful for a class that has to get up close and personal to giant Zeds). A later update made it slightly more viable mostly by changing Fortitude, a second-tier skill that completely outclassed Vampire, into the first-tier Dreadnaught (where it instead competes with a skill to increase speed and allow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualRegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualRegeneration">Gradual Regeneration</a>), giving Vampire a bonus to attack speed, and giving it a more reasonable counterpart in Butcher, which has a slightly higher attack speed bonus and gives a damage bonus instead of the health-drain effect.</li><li> Field Medic's Regeneration skill passively recovered health, but at the absolutely abysmal rate of 2 HP every 5 seconds. For comparison, every class has a syringe that can self-heal 20 HP every 15 seconds, with the Medic getting bonuses to the point that, at the highest level, they can recover 30 health every 5 seconds. Strangely, the Support's version of the same skill healed twice as much in half the time, fast enough to actually be worth using, but both versions of the skill were removed regardless.</li><li> Regeneration's alternative, Lacerate, made all perk weapons inflict fifteen seconds of bleed damage. The amount inflicted each second was proportional to the attack's power, but it's such a small fraction (2%) that even the most powerful Field Medic weapon only did <em>any</em> bleed damage thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">rounding up</a>. Functionally, it increased damage rate by a piddling 1 point per second then, very slowly, did 15 damage afterward, in a game where the weakest enemy has 55 HP, which is why it too was removed from the game.</li><li> Zed Napalm, for the Firebug, makes fires spread from one Zed to another. But Firebug weapons aren't exactly precise in their application, so if the Zeds were close enough to each other for one that's on fire to spread it to the others, then they'd have been close enough that they'd <em>all</em> have caught fire from your attack in the first place. Eventually it was buffed to also increase burning duration by 150%.</li><li> The Demolitionist's Door Traps made doors you've welded explode when they're broken down. Barricading itself is, at best, a situational strategy, and demolished doors cannot be repaired except by a support specialist taking about a minute away from actually fighting to repair the door. In comparison, Siren Resistance prevents Sirens from destroying Demolitionist's explosives (i.e. <em>all</em> of their weapons except bullets from the M16), completely removing what is easily the most irritating part about playing Demolitionist. Door Traps was later made into a passive ability the Demolitionist always has, replaced with Fragmentation Rounds - which, increasing the explosive radius but decreasing the damage, still isn't even remotely a fair comparison against what is now called Sonic Resistant Rounds. Eventually, the damage reduction in Fragmentation Rounds was removed, making it a reasonable alternative to Sonic Resistant Rounds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">Prison Rape</a>: Alluded to with the collectibles on the Prison map.

Thus, when certain weapons are almost out of ammo, selling them and buying them back can restore some ammunition for <em>cheaper</em> than just buying the ammunition directly.</li><li> Hans Volter used to be best dealt with in between waves by deliberately letting him grab a player to siphon health from, since he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> otherwise. An update changed this to give him a shield as he attempts to grab players to heal, one that can be destroyed when damaged enough to break him out of that phase and go back to just shooting and lobbing grenades.</li><li> The Patriarch's minigun suffers from an oversight where if you're as close to him as possible when he's firing it, he will not be able to hurt you at all, because you clip right through the barrel and beyond the exit point of his bullets. Because of this, if he decides to use it right next to you, running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">right at him</a> increases your chances of survival and lets you dish out some free damage for several seconds.
