The general consensus is that <em>Rome</em> is a completely separate entity from the rest of the series.

So that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">tabletop game based on a video game based on a tabletop game</a>.</p><p><em>Europa Universalis</em> has you take control of a nation from roughly 1400 to the early 1800s. There are roughly 200 playable nations, although some are more playable than others. While not <em>every</em> nation is in the game, a good chunk of them are, and so apart from standbys like France or Britain you can try your hand at a world conquest as the Iroquois, the Duchy of Bavaria or the Sultanate of Adal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Or</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">Sweden</a>.</p><p>The games have a history of buggy releases and somewhat impenetrable interface, with a variety of concepts not being adequately explained by game documentation (sometimes because they weren't <em>in</em> the original release version...), making the learning curve something of a learning cliff, and this is arguably the <em>least</em> complex of the Paradox Interactive strategy games.</p><p>The games also have an impressive community of writers, whose dabbling in the artform known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport">After Action Reports</a> is nothing to sneeze at. Some of their works are simple gameplay narrations, but others are intricate works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction">fan fiction</a> indeed.</p><p><em>Europa Universalis</em> is closely linked to three other series of grand strategy games, all of them made by Paradox: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun">Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartsOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartsOfIron">Hearts of Iron</a></em>. Theoretically, they can all be played in one big historically chronological succession thanks to a pretty brilliant (though somewhat buggy) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> system created by the developers, and the modding community will often create their own converters to fill in any gaps.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This game series provides examples of the following tropes :</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbUrbeCondita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbUrbeCondita">Ab Urbe Condita</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">Alternative Calendar</a> used in Europa Universalis: Rome, regardless of the nation being ruled.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: If a ruler is born with a 6/6/6 score it means he's the best at all three of the game's ruling skills: administration, diplomacy and warfare. The ruler who comes closest to that at the game start is Skanderbeg of Albania, with a 6/5/6 score. A small handful of historical rules (Louis XIV, Peter the Great etc) at later dates also get stats of this magnitude.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks">Actually Four Mooks</a>: No matter how many tens of thousands of your troops are in a given province, they will only ever show up as a single soldier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale">Who's taller than mountains</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDesertsHaveCacti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDesertsHaveCacti">All Deserts Have Cacti</a>: The "desert" graphics in EU2 have cacti. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation">Even in Persia.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: For some reason, Genoa's unique missions in EU4 tend to be named this way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: A popular reason for loving the game series is because of the ability to "correct" things that went "wrong" in real history. A lot of it is really funny, especially when the player has had nothing to do with it. Some examples: Milan blobbed all over Europe, England eaten by Northumberland, Protestant Syria, the landlocked African nation of Sokoto winding up in control of Burma, and Ming China wandering around Egypt in the early 1400s. This has led to the concept of "hands-off games", where the player picks an out-of-the-way nation like Ceylon and disables popups, then leaves the game running for a few hours and comes back to see what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity has ensued</a>.<ul><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatCode">console command</a> that lets you enter "Spectator Mode", which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">lets you do just that</a>. The AI controls every country and reveals the whole map, leaving the player to sit back and watch "history" unfold.</li><li> "Henry IV of Lancaster led the 14000 strong French army against the 6000 strong Ottoman army, and their forces were triumphant."</li><li> Importing a saved game from <em>Crusader Kings II</em> adds another layer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>, as you play on a map that's been changing since 1066 or as early as <em>769</em>. Sadly, it only affects Europe, the Middle East and India as <em>Crusader Kings</em> does not have a truly global map.<ul><li> Though a save where the <em>Sunset Invasion</em> DLC was present does DRASTICALLY change the North American Continent by effectively giving the Aztecs a more powerful unique variant of Western Tech group and allowing nearby natives to Westernize long before Europeans come across the sea, possibly even resulting in a new Sunset Invasion as the natives invade Europe again instead of the other way around.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryWank">Alternate History Wank</a>: Taking obscure one-province minors (such as Navarre, Trebizond or Xhosa) and turning them into major powers is literally a hobby for some experienced players.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a>: In <em>IV</em>, the Mamluk sultanate is this to the Ottomans, due to the Ottomans having several mechanical advantages. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gj3g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0gj3g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gj3g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Ottomans can gain Empire rank simply by conquering Constantinople, while the Mamluks have to either form another nation with Empire rank (usually Arabia) or gain enough land to reach 1000 development <em>and</em> accumulate enough prestige. By forming Arabia, Mamluks also lose their unique Mamluk government type, while the Ottomans' government type gives them substantial bonuses, including an additional maximum of 3 states, the best bonus in this category after the Russians' unique Tsardom government. In addition, the Ottomans only have to worry about the Mediterranean when it comes to ruling the seas, while Mamluks have to split their fleets between the Med and the Red and Arabian Seas.</span> Ironically, they start 1444 as the world's second-ranked Great Power, while the Ottomans are third.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>: Oh so averted. Your citizens are ANYTHING but apathetic and will revolt for a whole host of reasons. In the expansion to EU3 especially there are multiple kinds of rebels, who will do unpleasant things to you should you let them rampage (like converting your country to their preferred religion, change your government type, install a new monarch or declare independence)<ul><li> One type of rebel that crops up a lot are the Particularists.

They are similar to peasant revolts in that their main effect is to raise local autonomy of occupied provinces.</span></li><li> Rebel units may be weak compared to your army. But, when you have low stability and high overextension, they pop up ALL THE TIME.

Although this can be seen as desperation to stop your country's inexorable advance. Countries that have burst their badboy/infamy limit have generally taken over a hell of a lot of land very quickly. It works too; even if a few countries fall a nation fighting the whole of Europe and a few nations outside it will find it will be overwhelmed eventually; the most said country can hope for is to knock out a few rivals quickly and then grimly hold the line.<ul><li> The AI can't deal with naval attrition, and no one's been able to solve the problem.

That leads to a few quite badass, if sometimes misguided, boasts. For example, if high instability causes insubordination in one's army, the ruler can declare "Fine, I'll lead the army myself!" (while army tradition is being lost), or if you manage to draw the country back from the abyss of religious turmoil, proudly proclaim "ONE FAITH!"

In fact, combining even moderate narrow-mindness with DotF meant a research penalty in range of -25%, up to maximum of -30 (in <em>II</em>) or <em>-45</em> (in <em>III</em>). Any culture group that wasn't Latin had own, innate research penalty, which when combined with religious factors could go as far as outright <em>prevent any technological progress</em>, while a Latin country going full into religion had research on par with some backwater in the steppes of Central Asia - if not <em>worse</em>.</li><li> Muslim countries in <em>IV</em> face a choice: go pious and gain military bonuses... or go inpious and gain research <em>bonus</em> for being secular.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Beware the Nice Ones</a>: Several peaceful minor countries at the beginning of the game can become world powers by the end.

Early game, how much taxation your land puts out is your primary source of wealth, while only a few countries actually have enough control of a trade node to be making any signifiant income from it. However as you conquer the other nations in your Trade Nodes, take trade benefiting ideas ideas, and get more Merchants, a much larger portion of your money should come from trade. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Especially if you colonize in Asia</a>.<ul><li> This was an even bigger issue in <em>II</em> and <em>III</em>, where tax was collected <em>annually</em>, rather than monthly - you had to manage your budget for a whole year, with income generated only on 1st of January of the new year. All while cores and local culture (which were event-spawned or result of costly, decades-long investments) played big role in the percentage of collected tax, often reducing it to nothing. Trade, on the other hand, was accounted monthly, while unaffected by cores, ownership or cultures, all while being the only meaningfully way to fund research. However, in early game most of the map remains unexplored, so you are stuck with a small handful of centers of trade (or even just one) and have to compete with your neighbours over them, making profits often below expenses of sending and then maintaining merchants, all while lucrative monopolies are both tech-locked <em>and</em> quickly destroyed by fierce competition. This means focusing on taxing at least provides you a solid source of income that can't be removed from your coffers short from being conquered. But the more of the map gets explored and the more trade you could access, the less important land taxes become.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys</a>:<ul><li> Up until the <em>Heir to the Throne</em> expansion, <em>EU III</em> was a serious candidate for the most triumphant <em>aversion</em> of this trope.

An expert player sees this as a great opportunity to gain land, prestige, Imperial authority, or similar.

The problem with this is, it's almost laughably easy to take a mega country- like say, France, or Poland-Lithuania- into the Emperorship. The end result? A nation state consisting of a completely cored mega-state and most of Germany and Northern Italy. The devs tried to curb this by making it so the HRE state only gains cores on nations that directly border it- thus making the first 50 years a rather hectic period of running around playing whack-a-mole with rebels<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5e8fe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5e8fe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5e8fe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That is - if you didn't prepare for this by taking strategically important provinces beforehand, providing you with additional batch of cores</span> - but after 50 years, it gives you the undisputed most powerful nation in the world, with a manpower only rivaled by Ming China.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>: In <em>II</em>, diplomacy skill of your ruler is virtually meaningless, especially if below 7 (on 1-9 scale).

Going full narrow-minded, with harshest serfdom possible and actively using religion to back-up your goals, be them on domestic matters or against your enemies, is the easiest and most efficient way to go for global conquest and heavy colonisation. Add to that going fully decentralised state, where the ruler is a figurehead and every province does what it feels like doing... and it's even <em>easier</em> to conquer and maintain global domination. Your own population at large is too stupid, too beaten-down and too indoctrinated to know better, while nobody can oppose a country that can churm-up dirty cheap infantry in droves. Stability and war exhaustion are both non-issues, despite normally killing dead any conquering force, while the sheer number of troops possible to command means anyone stupid enough to declare war to oppose your evil empire is just making it easier for your own conquest, as technically, it was them attacking you, so everyone is content with defending their horrible homeland against would-be invaders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a>:<ul><li> Even as large and (relatively) prosperous country, you start out with only a fraction of the world revealed, limited access to trade and your main income being taxing poorly developed provinces. Infrastructure is almost non-existing, you have close to no monetary reserves and chances are, your ruler is just a guy - not terrible, but also nothing special. The first 100 or so years of gameplay are both the most crucial ones and the toughest, because things can't be cheesed up with colonial ventures, global trade or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish">Summon Bigger Fish</a> - those things aren't there yet and you need to wait for them to develop. Even if you cheat your situation, the world itself is still an early 15th century backwater, so you can't exactly reap any benefits, as there are virtually none build up yet. And if you happen to be an OPM<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6gybe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6gybe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6gybe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One-Province Minor</span>, things only add up further, since you have no manpower, no space to grow and obviously losing a single war means being booted out.<ul><li> Specifically in <em>II</em>, before you can promote governors in your provinces, just managing your budget is a feat by itself. The technology for governors is dated at 1530 and you are unlikely to reach it earlier (or even by that date). On top of that, unless you build tax collectors, you can forget about, well, collecting most of census tax, aka your main source of income in early game. If you aren't in debt or with double-digit inflation by 1500, you've either lucked out with events or used exploits.</li><li> Enforced with colonisation in <em>II</em>. Early on, it is done under <em>double</em> penalty: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">rookie mistakes</a>" for first 20 attempts (starting at -20% and only going down with each attempt made, regardless if successful) and date-based for first 200 years (starting at -25% in 1419 and going down by 1% per 8 years). And that without mentioning the regular penalties that come from tropical climate, aggressive natives or incompetent ruler. This turns early colonisation into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, especially considering how limited colonists are and how prohibitively expensive it is to gamble with your pre-governors budget.</li></ul></li><li> You can try to revive the glory of the Byzantine Empire - starting just a few decades before it was invaded in real life. You have only a few provinces (with ocean and enemy territory between your capital and them), an all but nonexistent army and navy, are surrounded completely by a much stronger enemy who wants your capital province and will work to claim it, and your only ace is that your capital province is a trade center, which really doesn't do you much good all things considered. There are nearby powers you can form alliances with, but they tend not to do much if any good unless the Ottomans find themselves in a bad position early on, which rarely happens. Recommended strategies tend to be "gamey", like exploiting the peace treaty and vassalage systems to gobble up territory in eastern Europe before the Ottomans can. Luckily the game does give the player considerable bonuses just for being able to expand into the Byzantine Empire's old territory, but most games played as Byzantium won't even make it to that point. The Muslim equivalent to the Byzantine Empire is Granada, with Castile (most likely Spain later), usually in conjunction with Portugal and Aragon, filling the role of the Ottoman Empire. <em>IV</em> even offers players who manage to pull off conquering all of Spain and Portugal as Granada the <em>Re-Reconquista</em> achievement.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: <em>II</em> plays <em>significantly</em> different than <em>III</em> and <em>IV</em>, which are far more similar to each other. Rulers are pre-defined, census tax not only is a thing, but provides main source of income early on, there are no advisors, structures are far less numerous or nuanced, regiments aren't even a thing, mercs are pre-definied and only accessible in Europe... the list goes for quite a while. Most importantly however, cultures and cores are fixed and can only be changed via events, while religious conversion takes forever and is by default unlikely. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">The map is also far less detailed, being adopted from a board game</a>.<ul><li> Did you notice nobody ever talks about <em>I</em>?

Every nation has a set number of States it can have (largely based on Admin tech and government type). States can have low autonomy (down to 0%), which meant that provinces which are part of States are the major contributors to the nation. On the other hand, Territories have a minimum of 75% autonomy, which largely limit their usefulness to the nation. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7urac');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7urac" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7urac');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's still played straight with Russia, as it can easily gain a whooping bonus of <em>twenty</em> additional states once Age of Revolutions starts, as early as 1710 (usually around 1715).

You might end up with 3-5 <em>months</em> of delay between one end of your empire to another when decisions are made and your infrastructure and administration are insufficient even for a small duchy. In fact, even a small duchy will end up with few days of delay, unless you have top-notch roads and postal service.

This also allows the taking over of entire nations without a single shot being fired, as you can befriend them, have a royal marriage, a long-lasting alliance and eventually propose a vassalage treaty, which they will gladly accept... fast-forward few decades of being nice and they will just get merged willingly into your country, while spending all that time in making their provinces rich and prosperous for you.

For example, every nation can descend into civil war if a king dies without an heir, but if the same happens in England at a certain time frame, the game will trigger a War Of The Roses event chain. Similarly, if Russia did not westernize after a certain date but is ruled by a competent king, an event chain might trigger that simulates the modernization reforms enacted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a>.

Do you want to give up the territory you've just conquered and/or make it unproductive for next 30 years... or do you want to simply send your troops to subdue locals with brute force? Do you want to get easy money from plundering natives or do you plan on spending precious monarch points on peace talks with insignificant tribes present only in the event? Forcefully converting any foreign cultures and religions into your own for quick rise of productivity and tax revenue, or spending decades or even centuries before you can add them to the group of "accepted" cultures within your country, with extra costs at that? The list can go on for quite a while, but unless you are a nationalistic, war-monging empire, the game not only gets hard and unrewarding, it's simply <em>boring</em> due to lackluster non-aggressive options.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>: In <em>III</em> and especially <em>IV</em>, certain advisers can become this particular timeline's equivalent of a famous person from history (a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail">In Spite of a Nail</a>).

When you press it an army of natives appears, either correspondent to the native population and attacks your army. After it's defeated the province loses that amount of people from it's native population. Through this method it's possible to render provinces with thousands of native inhabitants entirely deserted. Once the native population of the province reaches 0, getting it colonized gets <em>much</em> easier.<ul><li> It is worth noting this action is also heavily <em>discouraged</em>, especially in <em>II</em> and <em>III</em>, where native population is added to province pop once the colony turns into a town. In some cases, this can provide a new town with a whooping population of 26 thousands - something that would be otherwise simply impossible to achieve within the timeframe of the game. <em>IV</em> eventually added a bonus to trade value scaled with native population when colony turns into a province, but in intial release, it wasn't present and extreme measures were the only sensible way of colonising at all, as there was simply no benefit for keeping natives around.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a>: the standard version, and also the fact that "unexplored territory" can only be removed by armies or navies led by conquistadors and explorers respectively.

The Crusade of Varna was essentially an attempt by Poland and Hungary AND Croatia (all 3 in a Personal Union), Serbia, Lithuania, Moldavia, the HRE, the Pope and the Teutonic Knights to curb the Ottomans' expansion into Europe. The war was lost after the Polish-Hungarian-Croatian King Wladislaw was killed in the Battle of Varna. The Crusade itself practically shaped the political landscape of Eastern Europe for the rest of the game as this list of the after-effects will attest:<ul><li> Destruction of the Hungarian-Polish-Croatian Personal Union. King Wladislaw of Poland was granted the Crown of Hungary and Croatia with the Pope supporting him on the condition he joined the Crusade of Varna. The crusade didn't go so well and since Wladislaw died heirless (he died in Varna at age <strong>18</strong>), what would've been a PU between Hungary and Poland (Croatia came packaged with Hungary), was gone.</li><li> The Hungarian and Polish being in Interregna at the start of the game.</li><li> Hungary electing Matthias Corvinus and kicking off the rule of House Hunyadi which later culminates in the Austro-Hungarian Union.

Each governor building provides +1% to population growth (per decade), +1 production income (which in <em>II</em> is <em>a lot</em>) and the magikarp bit of it: 0.25 decrease of yearly inflation. However, the amount of provinces with governor was compared with total number of provinces in your country, decreasing the anti-inflation value accordingly. But if all of your provinces had a governor, a <em>whooping 25% of your total income</em> could be put directly into your coffers <em>without any ill effect</em>. This in turn allowed to stop relying on annual tax income, along with massive increase of money reserve, allowing to build military, improve infrastructure, send merchants to far away places and colonise like crazy.</li><li> Slaves in <em>II</em> and (especially) <em>III</em> start as a lackluster trade good with low price and are ignorable... until colonisation starts picking up the pace. Each province that produces cotton, tobacco or sugar (and coffee in <em>III</em>) sharply increases demand for slaves, turning them quickly into insanely profitable commodity. More so if it's not held by a nation following animism religion (so giving an incentive to conquer natives). <em>III</em> added a further modifier, which increases the value of slaves if the province producing "plantation goods" is on a different landmass than your capital (so a colony). If you directly own any province(s) "producing" slaves, you will be hard-pressed to eventually abolish slavery - that's how profitable they get once most of the world is colonised.</li><li> In <em>III</em>, the various basic provincial decisions on their own don't look like anything important or powerful, providing minor, almost invisible bonuses... but those quickly add up together. Most countries start as feudal monarchies, with tiny amount of magistrates provided per year. But with extensive passing of two provincional decisions, "Build post office" and "Expand road network", one keeps gaining +0.01 of <em>monthly</em> (rather than yearly) increase of magistrates. Pass 8 of those and you gain additional magistrate each year. Pass 50 of those<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8q923');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8q923" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8q923');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And the 25 provinces needed to do that isn't even that much, being roughtly the size of France or Spain</span> and you gain a magistrate <em>every other month</em>. This in turn allows to just <em>spam</em> decisions of real importance, like "Enact Land Reform" or ones with nation-wide effects. If done early on, this quickly turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>. And of course, both post offices and roads provide their own bonuses to production and trade - even if small, they are still a cheap increase of production and trade efficiency.</li><li> Similarly, Trade Depot/Marketplace is <strong>the</strong> most sought after building in the game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9bsei');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9bsei" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9bsei');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to the point of people cheating just to provide AI with it</span>, that also shows up with low tech requirements. Trade depot adds +1 (marketplace <em>+2</em> and +1% population growth) to trade value of the province, at price of 75 ducats (<em>50</em> for marketplace). <em>Per province</em>. This means an entire Center of Trade can greatly increase its value, especially in sparsely populated areas that produce low-value goods, suddenly making trade lucrative.</li><li> Latin culture group in <em>III</em> and <em>IV</em>. Your cavalry is a laughing stock with close to zero progression, your infantry adopts firearms quite late and for the most parts, your units are mediocre or worse. Come 17th century and onward and your units are becoming much better with less technological progress needed, not only catching up with everyone, but gradually gaining an edge. By early 18th century, Western European infantry is the best in the game and only gets stronger from there (and everyone else is virtually stuck at their current, already weaker state), while cavalry gains badly needed upgrades.</li><li> Shipyards and Regimental Camps (along with their upgrades) in <em>IV</em> increase respectively naval (+2) and land (+1) force limits. A single building is almost meaningless, making room for two ships or a single regiment... but when build into a handful of provinces, this can multiply the force limit into just silly values.</li><li> Germany starts out divided into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">dozens and dozens of mostly one province little countries</a>. Conquer the right ones and you can gain the option to form Germany which can quickly become one of the most powerful countries in the game. Do this early in the game before Spain, France, Russia, and Great Britain have formed and you easily have THE most powerful country in the game.</li><li> The Timurids (once Timur himself dies) are prone to rebellions and other woes even by horde standards. Successfully reform the government into a proper kingdom, however (or better yet, form the Mughal Empire), and you've got a powerful nation with mountainous terrain that can be a nightmare to invade, access to multiple high-value trade zones,<em>and</em> lots of potential for colonization, with Africa and some Pacific islands close by.</li><li> Generally, any large nation in Asia or Africa if you adopt institutions soon enough.</li><li> Bahmanis starts out as a medium-power Indian kingdom with some stellar national ideas and Vijayanagar to the south as their only real threat. Overcoming them initially can be a challenge, but taking their cores and those of Orissa to the east will let you form Hindustan and get <em>permanent</em> claims on <em>all</em> remaining territories in the Indian subcontinent. If you can manage to unite India, you have a <em>terrifying</em> beast with limitless potential: population and resources to rival Ming but with superior government and military bonuses, plus alliance possibilities with the Muslim nations of the middle east, and even the chance to do a bit of colonising in Africa and Indonesia.</li><li> Byzantium in <em>EU IV</em> starts the game with just four provinces and a vassal, all menaced by the enormous Ottoman Empire. If you somehow can defeat them, you will find out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> is actually a rather capable nation, with strong national ideas, top tier orthodox religion, a powerful mission tree and several unique events that will boost your mana production.

On the one hand, this is a drawn-out process which, in the short term, hurts the realm's stability and finances. On the other hand, when Harmonization is complete, the country gets a permanent bonus and all provinces of that religion (if it's Shintoism or a Buddhist sect) or that <em>entire religion group</em> (if it's anything else) are counted as "the true faith."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> with Fetishist nations. Through contact with other religion groups (and Fetishists in other regions of Africa), the stable of Cults they can choose from gradually expands; thus, the larger the nation, the more options it has. Unfortunately, Hindu and Tengri mechanics are very similar, but provide better bonuses, while Confucianism lacks flexibility but has the potential to become <em>much</em> more powerful; combined with Fetishism's lackluster missionary strength, it really can't compare even with every Cult unlocked.</li><li> Ibadism is much less present on the map than its sister faiths Sunnism and Shiism, with as few as 3 nations practicizing it in 1444.

But since nearly all of those national ideas only get unlocked later on in the game, your nation will initially be among the weakest in the world and you need to manage to survive the first 100 years or so before you really start to reap the benefits of your powerful ideas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantPrince">Merchant Prince</a>: Merchant Republics are ruled by this sort of character.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a>: Any given human player is aware that (a) Americas exists, (b) Africa can be circumnavigated to reach India and (c) South East Asia along with Far East are full of rare, expensive trade goods.

Russia and Spain, particularly, will almost never form at the appropriate time. Sometimes the effect is reversed - Great Britain tends to form centuries early, primarily because England already has most of the conditions to form it, and all it needs is to take over two provinces in Scotland and hold them until they become cores.<ul><li> Divine Wind has made it so Britain at least forms close to when it is supposed to because it gets a mission to conquer Scotland at around that time. Brandenburg-Prussia has a tendency to never form unless a human plays Brandenburg (the <em>Duchy</em> of Prussia forms often since all that needs to happen is for the Teutonic Order to survive until the Reformation, but Brandenburg often fails its missions to conquer the Prussian lands or doesn't become Protestant, which is required to form the Kingdom of Prussia).

But once firearms and thus fire rating are introduced for infantry, cavalry gets so heavily outclassed (being a shock unit without fire phase until 17th century), you might abandon it entirely if not for minor bonuses it provides in combat. Most guides openly suggest ditching cavarly aside token force of two regiments per army once infantry has fire rate and artillery can be build.</li><li> If cavalry loses revelance after a century, it's a matter of just few years for galleys to do so on seas. In <em>II</em>, they <em>never</em> receive any upgrades, especially regarding movement speed, making them completely obsolete by 16th century. In <em>III</em> and <em>IV</em> they start as poor man's heavy ships and quickly get obsolete, rarely receive any upgrades (and none at all from early 18th century onward) and generally being lackluster by the time galleons show up. On top of it all, they can't leave coastal zones when outside inland seas (Med, Black and Baltic) or they will simply disappear, making their use extremely limited.</li><li> In <em>II</em>, explorers and conquistadors become this respectively once hitting 27th level of naval and 31st of land tech - every single navy and army can explore terra incognita by early-to-mid 17th century.

It's also a complete pushover.</li><li> Ottomans eventually become this. Problem is, most of their empire is going to be made up of European backwater provinces, deserts of north Africa and mostly useless Middle East provinces, almost all of it of the wrong cultures (and in <em>II</em> and <em>III</em>, barely any way to change it).

Oh, and cultures of populations living exclusively in territories <em>cannot</em> be made acceptable by your nation, even if your nation can otherwise accept more cultures. They are also harder to convert to the state religion; this is compounded by the mechanic that only populations who follow the state religion can have their cultures changed.</li></ul></li><li> Colonial Nations in <em>IV</em> are very often this, especially when they are the only CN in given region: a huge blob on the map that's underdeveloped, with almost zero infrastructure and constantly cash-strapped, struggling with just about any task.

If Russia survives until the Age of Revolutions, it can then use an unique ability which grants it an extra capacity for <em>twenty</em> states. With the <em>Dharma</em> expansion, the Mughals are also this, as they can choose <em>three</em> different reforms at different tiers, each allowing them an extra capacity for three states, for a total capacity of 29 with the third reform chosen.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallSecludedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallSecludedWorld">Small, Secluded World</a>: The game starts during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges">The Late Middle Ages</a>, with most countries having only knowledge about their vicinity and rest of the globe waiting to be explored.

Unless there is a breach in the walls, you have a technological advantage and a decent commander and massive numerical advantage (which means you can't stay for long in the province, or attrition is going to maim your army), the far more sensible scenario is to simply besiege the fort for few months until it surrenders.<ul><li> In <em>II</em> you can't even start storming until reaching proper (albeit low-level) technology.

The end result? Easily in excess of a hundred thousand rebels. And this happens every time the king dies!

Colonial empires created by small countries also are likely to be omitted, since eligible subject nations only provide half of their development to the counter (and colonial provinces are most likely going to be underdeveloped anyway) - never mind that such colonial masters can indirectly control half of a continent (or <em>world</em>) and by default have huge fleets. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16hxmq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16hxmq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16hxmq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">However, such colonial masters are sitting on powder kegs as their colonial empires tend to be disloyal, particularly if different colonial nations decide that they want to be independent <em>together</em>, and declare wars simultaneously.</span> It is common for large colonial nations to be ranked as Great Powers after their independence wars if they emerged from the wars largely intact.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale">Units Not to Scale</a>: Soldiers are province-sized sprites and bigger than ships.

This means that you can attack another country without any casus belli, defeat their allies, and then demand that those allies pay you money in reparations.</li><li> As of patch 1.12 there's an achievement for receiving war reparations from ten different countries at once.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>: In <em>IV</em>, if you plan to benefit from dyes as trade goods, your goal is to prevent Europeans controlling even a single province in Bengal region<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17u87b');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17u87b" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17u87b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">roughtly 1/5th of Indian subcontinent</span>, the historical source of dyes - even if you're playing as European nation yourself. This prevents the "Increased availability of dyes" event from firing, which decreases the price of dyes for the rest of the game. Ironically, you can in the same time colonise every possible region that can spawn dyes as local trade goods, <em>greatly</em> increasing actual global production, but the event only triggers in relation with European control of Bengal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">What the Hell, Player?</a>: The reputation ("badboy" or "infamy") mechanic is supposed to be this. Aggressive acts (annexing nations, declaring wars without <em>casus belli</em>, taking territories that you don't have cores on) add badboy points to your reputation score. If you keep your aggression in moderation, your score will eventually go down with time; however, if you go on a conquering binge, don't be surprised if all your neighbors suddenly decide to gang up on you all at once.<ul><li> In <em>IV</em>, the mechanic was replaced by the Aggressive Expansion penalty gained by demanding provinces at peace talks, annexing personal union partners or vassals, or vassalizing countries. Instead of being a global score that warrants war from anyone, it is a relation penalty applied to your immediate neighborhood that, if too large, gives said neighborhood a propensity to form a coalition (a pact in which if one member declares war on you, all others do) against you. Despite this, it was originally incredibly unbalanced - in one EU4 patch, you would get aggressive expansion for <em>reclaiming your own cores</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace">Won the War, Lost the Peace</a>: If you're not careful, you can fight a war to a victory only to find that your country has descended into a rebel-haunted death spiral, and the new annexations prove to be nothing more than another spawning ground.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>: Fully justified, since the game takes place during the golden centuries of the Age of Sail. The nautical feel is definitely present - even in some of the music themes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed">The World Is Always Doomed</a>: For the Nahuatl religion in <em>El Dorado</em>, the world is always on the brink of destruction and needs to be saved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>.
