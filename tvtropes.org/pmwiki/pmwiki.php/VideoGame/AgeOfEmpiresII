With the release of the HD edition of the original game, <em>Forgotten Empires</em> was turned into an official expansion, entitled <em>Age of Empires II: The Forgotten</em>. It was released on Steam on November 7, 2013.</p><p>Another official expansion, <em>Age of Empires II: The African Kingdoms</em>, was released on November 5, 2015, with the Berbers, Malians, Ethiopians, and Portuguese as new civilizations. A third expansion, <em>Age of Empires II: The Rise of the Rajas</em> premiered on December 19, 2016, featuring civilizations in the Southeast Asian region which includes the Khmers, the Malays, the Burmese, and the Vietnamese. The two expansions also feature campaigns depicting leaders from the civilizations (from listed order of civs: Tariq ibn Ziyad, Sundjata, Yodit, Francisco de Almeida, Suryavarman I, Gajah Mada, Bayinnaung and Le Loi).</p><p>A <em>Definitive Edition</em> of Age of Empires II was announced in 2018, and was released in November 2019 on Steam and Windows Store. The <em>Definitive Edition</em> includes updated graphics, the 13 civilizations introduced in <em>HD</em>, and four new civilizations: Lithuanians, Bulgarians, Tatar and Cumans, alongside a new campaign set called "The Last Khans", depicting how different civilizations dealt with the aftermath of the Mongol invasions initiated by Genghis; leaders depicted include Tamerlane (Tatars), Ivaylo (Bulgarians) and Kotyan Khan (Cumans).

An added bonus also returns the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Wololo</a> sound for the Monk conversion. On December 15, 2020, there is an announcement of a new <em>Lords of the West</em> Expansion featuring the new Burgundian and Sicilian factions, as well as three new campaigns, to be released on January 26, 2021.</p><hr><h2><em>Age of Empires II</em> and its expansions give examples of:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>: A few.<ul><li> All civilizations have access to naval units and technologies, including those from landlocked regions like the Mongols, or most of the Mesoamerican ones. While it can be handwaved that certain nations do still make use of boats and ships within the rivers and lakes of their geographic regions, full-blown navies are still a bit far-fetched in those cases, especially with large ships. The Mongolian steppes in particular are smack-dab in the middle of the Gobi desert, and thus have little to no access to open water and navies, not that they needed either (they <em>do</em> have a fairly well-established navy with which they tried to invade Japan twice, but the majority of their conflicts are settled on land). This is done so that no civilization will be disadvantaged when playing on coastal or island maps, where a lack of sea vessels means they can't fish or engage in naval combat against their opponents.</li><li> With the release of <em>Definitive Edition</em>, more herdable animals have been added to maps that can be slaughtered for food like the vanilla sheep or turkeys. This can give rise to rather unusual circumstances that would not fly in reality, such as Indians killing and gathering food from cows, or Muslim nations like Turkey eating pigs. From a gameplay perspective, this is done so that no player will be disadvantaged by the random herdable spawns around their Town Center no matter which animals they get.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">Acrofatic</a>: Most Kings<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mrvl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2mrvl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mrvl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they get separate appearances depending on the building style from <em>The African Kingdoms</em></span> are examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex">Adipose Rex</a>, yet they can outrun a horse despite being themselves unmounted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: Yes, the Scottish lost the Battle of Falkirk, the Mongols never conquered all of Europe, and the Barbarossa campaign ends with a group of crusaders smuggling their dead emperor's body to Jerusalem - an attempt which failed miserably in real life as they didn't manage to preserve the body. But the campaigns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">wouldn't work with failures</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">It's clear that the developers know that many aspects are inaccurate.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: Each building, technology and unit in the game gets a detailed historical description.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>:<ul><li> The existence of gunpowder units when it's not possible:<ul><li> Once added in <em>The Conquerors,</em> petards (gunpowder suicide bombers) are available at any castle, in both the original and expansion campaigns (petards only appeared in the 16th century). Enjoy blowing the Spanish up with them as the Aztecs.</li><li> In the Spanish campaign in <em>The Conquerors</em>, El Cid, in the 11th century, enlists the help of Conquistadors... who in the game take the form of a cavalry unit firing arquebus guns from horseback (disputable if even that was done, or if the pistol had to be invented first).</li><li> In the final mission of the Attila the Hun campaign, which takes place in the 5th century, you destroy a Roman city guarded by Bombard Towers.</li><li> Averted in some campaigns that make it so that gunpowder units are not accessible outright, such as the Alaric, Prithviraj, and Tariq ibn Ziyad campaigns as well as the Manzikert historical battle.</li><li> The Aztecs can find Korean Turtle Ships, or at least a weapon that is best represented by them, to face the onslaught of the Spanish Navy. The <em>Definitive Edition</em> replaces them with Cannon Galleons abandoned by the Spanish Navy themselves.</li></ul><div class="indent"> What are these? Gifts from the gods?</div></li><li> Viking Berserkers have horned helmets. Not only was that proven 100 times over to be a Victorian myth already before 1999, but 'Berserker' would have more than likely reflected someone wearing a bear skin. Hence the name origin; bear skin wearer, could be looked at as 'bear serker'. Alternatively, they could have simply fought naked to show their bravery. But then, logic demands that they'd just be easier to kill...</li><li> The third scenario in the Le Loi campaign is named The Battle at Hanoi. The city only became known as Hanoi during the French colonial era, some four hundred years later. It should be called Dong Quan at the time, which was its official name under Ming rule by then, before being renamed into Dong Kinh after Le Loi had established the Le dynasty.<ul><li> While we're at it, the use of "Vietnamese" to refer to the civilization is also greatly anachronistic. The nation only came to be known as "Vietnam" during the very early 19th century, in 1804, around twenty years prior to the capital being renamed into Hanoi as mentioned above. During the time of Le Loi, it was known as Dai Viet (Vietnamese were meant to be an umbrella term for the Dai Viet as well as the Champa. That's why they originally had the Southeast Asian architecture).</li></ul></li><li> The Dome of The Rock is shown (in "The Siege of Jerusalem" and "The Emperor Sleeping") with a golden roof. Its iconic golden roof was added in 1963. Before then it had a black lead roof.</li><li> The Frank unique unit is the Throwing Axeman, and like all unique units it becomes available towards the Castle age, and improved in the Imperial age. Ironically the famous Frankish axe throwers were most common during early Frankish history, and had long ceased to be a thing by the high and late medieval ages. The units' appearance in the campaigns of Saladin, Barbarossa, and Joan of Arc is an anachronism.</li><li> This is averted in certain campaigns whenever certain civilizations with a specific timeframe for their tech tree is used to represent an enemy faction, but the unique units are not fitting for the time or place of the faction they are representing, hence "Italians" without Genoese Crossbowmen and "Turks" without Janissaries.</li><li> At the outro of the final Joan of Arc level, "A Perfect Martyr," Guy Josselyne states Joan was later declared innocent and "eventually beatified as a saint." While she was retried and pronounced innocent and considered a martyr three years after the events of this level, she was beatified in 1909 and canonized a saint in 1920, five centuries after Josselyne's death. The game also gives the impression, intentionally or otherwise, the Battle of Castillion takes place shortly after the Siege of Paris and Joan's trial and execution, when it was actually over twenty years later, and La Hire had died of disease a decade earlier.</li><li> The presence of Mongols &mdash; stated to be near Hungary &mdash; in the first Barbarossa level, "Holy Roman Emperor," as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> to the Genghis Khan campaign. The Barbarossa campaign starts around 1152, a century before the Mongols' invasion of Europe; they would not enter Hungary until the Battle of Mohi in 1242. This was changed to Cumans in the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, who had a presence in the Carpathian Mountains and fought several wars against the Kingdom of Hungary in that era.</li><li> The Hajia Sofia appears in "The Walls of Constantinople," around 440, an entire century before it was built, in 537. It was built on the site of a wooden basilica, which burned down in 532, so it is presumably representing that.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>: The Goth Huskarl, Vietnamese Rattan Archer and Pre-Columbian American Eagle Warriors are very effective anti-archer units due to their high pierce armor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiCavalry">Anti-Cavalry</a>: Spearmen and Camels both get a damage bonus against enemy cavalry, making the former two highly effective counters to the latter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: The <em>Definitive Edition</em> implemented some features that make gameplay smoother:<ul><li> The military units' default stance can be set to "Defensive" or "Stand Ground" stance instead of the usual "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Aggressive</a>" stance, because many units would become distracted by a single enemy scout.</li><li> The "Idle Villager" button now has an indicator on how many of them are idle.

The newer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">A.I.s</a> in the <em>HD</em> and <em>Definitive</em> editions (HD AI and DE AI respectively) fixes some of these problems:<ul><li> As opposed to the HD AI, which uses the same engine as the CD AI just with better scripts, the DE AI was written from the ground up. It has a new difficulty level beyond Hardest called "Extreme" and has learned some new tricks such as pushing huntables towards its Town Center using its initial scout cavalry, using herdables to scout the map, and building emergency palisades and towers to protect its gold mines if hit by a Feudal Age rush.</li><li> The CD AI will often send their armies to attack in the form of long columns of units single-mindedly marching towards one spot, totally oblivious to any enemy armies they encounter along the way, sticking together and moving at the speed of their slowest unit. Players can abuse this to decimate AI armies before they reach their target. The HD AI players try to target buildings on the edge of the enemy town first (and less likely to wander into a gauntlet of enemy defenses), work its way in, and retreat if necessary. The DE AI behaves similarly to the HD AI, but is much better at staying just outside of the range of enemy defenses.</li><li> The CD AI will instantly demolish any building in progress if the villager building it is attacked. This was a hacky solution to the issue of AI players sending their entire population of villagers one by one to finish an incomplete building in territory that had been taken by the enemy. However, it caused at least as many problems as it solved. The HD AI only deletes incomplete buildings if too many builders die trying to finish it.</li><li> The CD AI will never attack gates, so building your entire fortress out of gates will make it effectively AI-proof. The HD AI however does attack gates and won't fall for this trick.</li><li> It will also never delete its own units, so it will do things such as wall off its own resources, causing them to be inaccessible to it for the entire rest of the game. The HD and DE <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">A.I.s</a> don't have this flaw.</li><li> If you exploit the above two issues, you can trap a CD AI in its walled-off town forever by placing your gates in front of its.</li><li> More generally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">A.I.s</a> don't have any understanding of the concepts of "map control" or "micromanagement", making it very vulnerable to hit-and-run tactics by fast ranged units such as cavalry archers or Viking Longboats. The DE AI averts this by building forward bases and even try to steal enemy resources by build forward resource camps.</li><li> Pathing issues can render Trading Carts easy prey since they wander into enemy positions more often than not. Even if you clear a shortcut through thick forest, they'll insist on taking an inefficient route until you force them to save time by walling off the options that add time to their route. A similar issue affects villagers, especially when they are gathering berries.</li><li> What's the best visual indicator of an enemy empire at its height? Lots and <strong>LOTS</strong> of USELESS Mining Camps and Mills <em>everywhere</em>.</li><li> The AI's units don't seem to discriminate and just attack whatever they see. For example, the AI will often send its knights to attack a large group of Pikemen. With a little bit of micromanagement a player can easily wipe out the AI's entire army while taking minimal losses.</li><li> If you don't set your units to "Defensive" or "Keep Terrain" mode, you'll often find later that they have broken formation and spread all over the map running after a random scout, only to be killed in the enemy's base.</li><li> Pathfinding can sometimes be pretty terrible, but no unit suffers more from this than the Villager. Not only can they sometimes suffer from slow routes, they can sometimes end up deciding the most efficient way to gather the resource you want from them is to go as far away as possible from the collection point instead of move a little to the side.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>: The game had to take quite a lot of liberties to ensure a balanced and interesting gameplay experience.<ul><li> With exceptions such as the monks and warships, everybody uses the same set of generic unit sprites (models in <em>DE</em>), regardless of their civilization. This means that Mesoamerican or Asian players can field the same Champions clad in platemail and wielding zweih&auml;nders as European ones, and all Cavalry Archers look like they hailed from the Eurasian steppes, regardless of your own chosen faction. This is averted, however, in the 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> counterpart, where European, Japanese, and continental Asian civilizations respectively have unique, appropriate models for all generic units except mercenaries and siege weapons (both of which are justified).</li><li> Some units can be trained by many different civilizations, who never used them in the first place, like Eagle Warriors being available to the Mayans and Incas, despite being iconic to the Aztec alone. Bonus points go to the Paladins, who aren't limited to the Franks, despite being based on the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne and should have been treated as hero units for all intents and purposes, and the player can have much more than that amount at any one time.</li><li> Some of the unique units are either not unique to that civilization, or do not belong to their particular civilization. For example the Goths' Huskarl is a norse/saxon title. The Huns' noble unit, the Tarkan, is a mongol or turk title. Mamelukes were used by several Muslim regimes in history, not only the Saracens.</li><li> The manual describes skirmishers as throw-away troops, but in the game, presumably for for the purposes of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">Tactical Rock&#150;Paper&#150;Scissors</a>, the skirmisher is the hard counter to archer troops getting a bonus against them and horse archers. In fact, the game's skirmisher-archer relationship is pretty much the inverse of its <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirmisher">historical counterpart<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the ancient to pre-modern era, where skirmishers (usually armed with bows themselves), were intended to harass infantry and massed archers were supposed to prevent or stop this. Historically, the Romans being unable to stop greatly outnumbered horse archers with their javelin-armed skirmishers and legionaries (both sides having similar numbers of cavalry committed) resulted in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae">one of the worst defeats in Roman history<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In contrast, against heavy infantry, Athenian skirmishers armed with javelins were able to force Spartan hoplites to retreat <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria">multiple<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lechaeum">times<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in history. The major advantage of the javelin depicted with the game's skirmisher is that it has a lot of weight to cause problems to enemy's shields and armour, which is useless if he is instead attacking archers. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedStrategy">Turn-Based Strategy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> version of the game, however, depicts skirmishers in a more historically accurate light, as they always cause damage to melee units who attack them but are countered by foot archers, which outrange them.</li><li> Several historical figures are depicted taking part in battles they have no involvement in, or are absent from battles they did take part in, such as:<ul><li> The second El Cid scenario, "The Enemy of My Enemy", is loosely based on the conquest of Toledo (1081-85), which El Cid did not participate in as he was in exile at the time (1081-87).</li><li> The second Joan of Arc scenario, "The Maid of Orleans," Duke D'Alencon joins Joan in the relief of the Siege of Orleans and is absent in the next scenario, "The Cleansing of the Loire." This is inverse to reality, where he was not present at Orleans, but was a decisive commander in the Loire campaign, though he was not present for the Battle of Patay, which was the primary inspiration for that level. Similarly, La Hire, who appears in "The Cleansing of the Loire," is absent from "The Maid of Orleans" when he actually fought at Orleans and was even in command of the city's forces when Joan arrived. La Hire is also in "A Perfect Martyr" (based on the Battle of Castillion), which took place in 1453, a decade after his death of illness. Likewise, Constable Richmont is in "A Perfect Martyr" when he was not present at Castillion (though his nephew Peter II of Brittany was there and lead the cavalry charge that routed the English), but is not in "The Cleansing of the Loire" when he was at the Battle of Patay and met Joan of Arc (he was also at the Battle of Agincourt where he was wounded and captured, but is not in that scenario, either).</li><li> Burgundy is an enemy in "The Maid of Orleans" when they had made an agreement with Orleans and withdrew a week before Joan of Arc arrived, and "A Perfect Martyr" despite switching sides twenty years before then and becoming an ally of France. Ironically, they are <strong>not</strong> present in "The Rising" (based on the March to Reims, and the only scenario not to feature them), despite all the factions depicted, aside from the English army, being a part of, or occupied by Burgundy at the time.</li><li> The first Atilla the Hun level, "The Scourge of God," starts with Bleda's death (c. 445), then moves on to the Huns' invasion of Persia (c.435-40), and the second, "The Great Ride," details the Huns' Balkan campaign (c.440-45), both of which occurred while Bleda was still alive and co-ruler. Some historians speculate it was his decision to return to their camp after defeating the Eastern Roman Army instead of pressing on to nearby Constantinople (which did not yet have its famous double walls or sea wall at this point) lead to his death in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingAccident">Hunting "Accident"</a>. Additionally, the first level is usually won by defeating Persia when the Huns' invasion failed (leading them to move on to the Balkans) and the third level, "The Walls of Constantinople," has Philippopolis (modern day Plovdiv, Bulgaria) be sacked by Atilla, when it was actually sacked earlier in the Balkan campaign.</li></ul></li><li> Several campaign end very differently than in real life. For example, the Celts lost the Battle of Falkirk, Western Europe did not surrender to the Mongols after the Battle of Mohi, Saladin lost the Siege of Acre, Barbarossa's body never made it to Jerusalem, Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish.</li><li> In the intro to "The Maid of Orleans," Guy Josselyne states Joan of Arc sent him to find a sword behind the alter of "a local church," which turned out to have belonged to Charlemagne. The Sword of Charlemagne, Joyeuse, had been the coronation sword of the kings of France since 1270 and had been on display since the 13th century (currently at the Louvre since 1793). The sword found at the church of Saint Catherine de Fierbois is, according to legend, the sword of Charles Martel, Charlemagne's grandfather, left as an offering to Saint Catherine after the Battle of Tours (though Charles Martel often gets confused with his grandson Charlemagne).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">Artistic License &#150; Physics</a>: When fully garrisoned with Infantry, Mongol Siege Rams <em>are actually faster than Dark Age Scout Cavalry</em>.

The Gothic unique unit Huskarl is named after a historical Norse and Saxon unit (who spoke North and West Germanic languages, respectively).</li><li> The Huns share voice files with the Mongols. The Hunnic language is unknown but it's most commonly speculated to be Turkic. The Hunnic unique unit is named Tarkan, a noble title used by the Mongols and Turks but not recorded among the Huns.</li><li> The Byzantines speak Latin (and have at least one mistaken line, "I command?" in place of "Your command?"), but their most common language was Greek and they abandoned using Latin as administrative language in the 7th century.</li><li> The Italians reuse the Byzantines' Latin lines instead of using one of the Medieval Italian languages.</li><li> The Aztecs speak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec">Yucatec Maya</a> (the most common Mayan language) while the Mayans speak K'iche' Mayan.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">A-Team Firing</a>: Basically any towers and castles early on which just not able to hit moving targets at all, fixed after you research the Ballistics upgrade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>:<ul><li> Sandy Petersen is a big fan of the Aztecs, which is why <em>The Conquerors</em> was basically built around them.</li><li> The Hungarians (a.k.a.

While immensely powerful, they are tragically inaccurate, fire slowly, and have to be manually unpacked and repacked to fire and move, respectively.</li><li> Petards in <em>The Conquerors</em>, at least most of the time. Available in the Castle Age, and capable of dealing out huge anti-building damage quickly and easily. However, if you're using them around towers or castles, you're gonna lose two or three before they get there, and it's easy to run out of gold before you breach fortifications. What's worse is that they're <em>only cost-effective against Wonders</em> which means you're actually wasting time and resources trying to use them against anything else, let alone trying to produce them in the first place.</li><li> The Spies research. Getting the enemy line of sight is a massive advantage, but at 200 gold <em>per enemy villager</em> (as well as Fishing Ships and Transport Ships, which are not mentioned in the description), it tends to end up being several thousand gold per opposing player, more than enough to raise a sizable army. With the exception of some special scenarios and the Huns (who have a research that halves the cost), it's generally just better to fight conventionally, and the tech's usage is restricted to when your opponent is trying to artificially prolong an already-decided game by hiding his last villagers.</li><li> Back in the original <em>Age of Kings</em>, the mighty gunpowder units and Bombard Towers need to be researched first, <em>individually</em> after researching the Chemistry tech before they can be created. This is so expensive, time-consuming and redundant (even for the Turks, who get free Chemistry and discount for the aforementioned techs) that the research techs for Bombard Cannons and Hand Cannoneers are eventually removed in <em>The Conquerors</em>.</li><li> For standard multiplayer games, one of the possible win conditions is building a Wonder and keeping it around for 200 (in-game) years. However, this is extremely rarely done as Wonders are insanely expensive (1000 Wood, Gold, and Stone, which could be used for an army instead), everyone is notified when you build one (not even finish it, just laying foundation), and there is an in-game counter to let everyone know how much time they have left until they lose (or win). For this reason, the "Atheism" upgrade the Huns have falls under this category, as it only serves to delay (rare) Wonder and Relic victories.</li><li> Monks. You would think being able to steal enemy units was a pretty awesome ability, and depending on the type of unit, you would be correct. However, Monks can only do this one unit at a time, it takes time to finish, and Monks (which have pretty low base health) can be killed by other enemy units while attempting it, and if the enemy has the Heresy upgrade, the unit dies instead of being converted to your color, making the process useless. Furthermore, their conversion upgrades cost lots of gold that can be better invested in military units. So monks are better off as support by healing and gathering relics. </li><li> The Spearmen line actually has a rather hefty +9 bonus damage against <em>ships</em> of all things. Unless the enemy deliberately beach their ships onto the shoreline, or if their naval vessels path over the shallows, it's pretty safe to say this bonus damage will never be taken advantage of.</li><li> The Portuguese feitoria building which, like the Factory in <em>Age of Empires III</em>, trickles out resources every few seconds, only it gives all four at once instead of just one with the Factory. Except it's expensive to build (350 stone and gold, later changed/lowered to 250 wood and stone), is the same size as a Wonder, takes up 20 population spots, can even be converted (though Heresy makes it useless to the other player) and is slower than 20 villagers collecting the same resources. It's useful in late-game when most or all resources are depleted and a level in the Portuguese campaign where you can't create new villagers. It's also impervious to raids and requires siege weapons to destroy effectively.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">An Axe to Grind</a>: Throwing Axemen (Franks), Berserkers (Vikings) and Woad Raiders (Celts).

While the game expects you to build the Wonder in your city, in the original release there is an island in the west of the map that is just large enough, and only one of your enemies uses warships.</li><li> In Barbarossa's second mission "Henry the Lion", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Henry the Lion's army</a> is allied with everyone, including the Polish army... but the Polish army isn't allied with him.

If you don't build a castle, he never betrays you, although it means not making any Teutonic Knights or Trebuchets or researching Conscription (faster military unit creation) or the unique technology, Crenalations (regular infantry can fire arrows when garrisoned, castles have +3 range) or the second unique technology<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8y325');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8y325" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8y325');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Introduced in <em>The Forgotten</em>, but only available in the campaigns as of <em>Definitive Edition</em></span>, Ironclad (siege weapons have +4 melee armour). Henry the Lion is completely useless as an ally since he won't attack any of the Italian factions, but you already have three enemies to fight.</li><li> In Attila the Hun's first mission "The Scourge of God," If you ally with the Scythians, then they will probably attack the Persian fortress before you get the chance. Since the Persians are still marked as being allied with the Scythians, then the Persian AI apparently bugs out and just twitches spasmodically as the Scythian archers cut them to shreds.<ul><li> It's possible to defeat Persia with the starting units. They're still in the Feudal Age and don't have an army or Murder Holes, so you can destroy their towers, castle and town center and wipe out their villagers before they age up.</li></ul></li><li> Unintentional example: in Attila the Hun's fourth mission "A Barbarian Betrothal", you have to fight off the Roman Army's counterattack after you destroy all three cities. However, if you can find a placeholder unit hidden on the map, you can kill him, which breaks the script and allows you to skip the fight with the army. However, in later versions of the game, the army will still spawn even after the placeholder is killed, forcing the player to defeat them to finish the scenario, though now if you place a few units at the edge of the map on their spawn point, they are prevented from spawning, automatically winning the scenario.</li><li> In Montezuma's fourth mission "La Noche Triste" you have to retake Tenochtitlan, which is now occupied by the Spanish army, and destroy the Spanish wonder being built inside it before the time runs out. The script expects you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">fail</a> in your first attempt, make it to the docks with what is left of your original, small army, hijack some ships, cross the lake, find an allied town and rebuild your forces in time to march against Tenochtitlan again. However, to reach the docks you have to pass near the wonder building site with only a simple wall separating you from it, so a player can simply tear down the wall then and destroy the wonder before it is finished. There's even an <em>easier</em> way where you can just waltz straight into the construction site (you may even stumble upon this route by accident!) and destroy it effortlessly if you avoid the guards since said route is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissCheeseSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissCheeseSecurity">neither walled off nor filled to the brim with guards</a>. Even then, the Spanish don't even bother sending reinforcements to fend off those who interrupt the Wonder construction, unlike what even the Random Map <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">A.I.s</a> would do in the first place.</li><li> Several scenarios in "Battles of the Conquerors":<ul><li> "Tours": You're expected to play conventionally, building up your forces to hold off the enemy advance and eventually attack the Saracen-occupied city of Poitiers at the far south end to take their supply carts and send them back to Orleans. However, it's possible to beat the battle within minutes of starting by using Charles Martel and his army of knights and axemen at the southeast end of the map to attack the gate of Poitiers, baiting the garrison into heading out the gates to attack- just as the gate opens, wedge one of your knights under it to keep it from closing, allowing you to easily capture the carts and take them back to your base.</li><li> "Manzikert" : You have to force three Byzantine towns to pay tribute to you. By using anti-"fog of war" or you just know the map, Pisidia can be the first to pay tribute to you. They have no gates guarding them on Easy, enabling you to rush your Light Cavalry units to their Town Center. They have gates at harder levels but attacking the gate and withdraw closely will draw the defending Cavalry Archer units to attack at the opened gates, enabling you to rush your Light Cavalry through the gauntlet of enemies to their Town Center too. This strategy also works with Cappadocia's eastern gate. This tactic will keep their gates intact when they switch sides and get their tributes for <em>necessary</em> resource for early gameplay.</li><li> "Agincourt" : You start with a large army with a few monks and only 80 Wood and 85 Gold and cannot build a base. You can convert four villagers, task them with collecting 20 Wood each, then have them build a farm, which automatically deposits it in your inventory, which allows you to build a lumber camp, collect more wood and build a base, or just a dock to make a transport. Alternatively, you can rush through the map with just Henry V and reach the transport back to England.</li></ul></li><li> Your mileage may vary on "easy", but in the second mission of the Bari campaign, you have two enemies. One of them does not produce new units or have any buildings, the other does not produce units until you complete a certain objective. You are meant to bring a relic to the Norman village and receive it (this will prompt the Rebels to start producing units), fight your way to Potenza, complete an objective for them, receive Potenza's buildings, and then take Bari. Alternatively, once you are given a monk to help with the task to get the Norman village, if you can carefully manage troops to avoid losing any, you can make it to Potenza, complete their objective, receive the city along with a few villagers and a chunk of resources, and then storm Bari while they are still unable to produce new units.</li><li> In the fourth scenario of the Sundjata campaign, "Blood on the River", it is possible to trigger a glitch where endless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Gbeto</a> will spawn after saving the Mema Princess, pretty much turning the final battle into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>.</li><li> In the final mission of the Sundjata campaign, "The Lion's Den", the enemy will waste no time in overwhelming you from land and sea while you will struggle to advance and defend yourself from frequent, massive invasions. To make it worse, they will go for a <em>Wonder</em> victory after a certain amount of time. If you can wall a small chokepoint separating you and the enemy and build a Castle there, it will give you ample time to build up a strong enough force to storm their fortress. It helps that the enemy will never send troops through the sea, so you don't need to focus too much on building a navy. In terms of unit compositions, an army of Gbetos and siege weapons are enough to beat them on land, as they are mostly made of close combat units with low melee armor.</li><li> In the third mission of the Le Loi campaign, you receive military buildings and immediately pass by an extremely high HP gate with a Castle behind it you are clearly intended to bypass. However, just a bit later you will receive a large group of villagers. Shortly ahead of this is an area which will give you transport ships to cross a river. If you pay close attention to the highlighted area of the main enemy city, you will notice that receiving these ships is what activates the enemy ability to start gathering resources, producing new units, and upgrading. There are also a number of farms, trees, and gold deposits prior to the transport ships that you can have your new villagers gather. Using the Stable you were given previously in the mission, it is extremely easy to simply build a group of Battle Elephants, break down the gate, destroy the entire enemy base, and win the mission without them ever able to produce troops or effectively fight back.</li><li> In the first Genghis Khan level, "The Crucible", you can change your stance to neutral and use the monk to convert all the tribes' units without completing their tasks. Rectified with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> in the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, however, where they will immediately become hostile when this is done. The same change also applies to certain other campaigns where the player might be tempted to abuse the diplomacy change to nab free units from their allies (e.g. Dracula).</li><li> The second and third Dom Francisco levels, "The Lion of Africa" and "Ruins of an Empire", your allies will change their stance to enemy once the main enemy is defeated, and will themselves be defeated once you destroy their castle and wonder, respectively. You can put a catapult or bombard in front of that building and set it to Attack Ground to destroy it, which will cause them to be instantly defeated when the other enemy is defeated. Alternatively, you can bring it to within one hit and then wait for the other enemy to be defeated before destroying the building. Additionally, in Ruins of an Empire, you can build a base earlier than you're supposed to by switching your stance to neutral and converting an ally's villagers. The final level, "A Son's Blood," you're allied to everyone else until you convert Afonso, at which point they go to war with you and one will instantly gain a Wonder, but you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">Take Your Time</a> and build up your forces, exhaust all resources around their bases, abuse Attack Ground to destroy their entire bases and position troops around their units and where the Wonder will appear to defeat them when they become enemies.</li><li> The penultimate El Cid level, "King of Valencia," if you're fast you can build a wall in front of Berenger's gate, breaking the script completely and preventing him from sieging Denia or spawning new units. He has a few units scattered throughout the map, but once they're dealt with the entire map is yours. The objective of simply building a Wonder won't occur, requiring you to defeat Berenger, but aside from his starting units (which are stuck in the walled-off area and easy prey to cavalry archers or conquistadors) and four villagers (which makes Spies very cheap), his base is empty and can easily be destroyed with trebuchets and cannon (it may be necessary to destroy or convert Denia's Siege Workshop to win).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentGame">Edutainment Game</a>: The first purpose of the game is entertainment, but there's plenty of historical information available:<ul><li> The campaigns in <em>Age of Kings</em> covered historical wars, such as William Wallace's war against England (as the tutorial), Joan of Arc fighting in the Hundred Years' War, Saladin fighting against the Crusaders, Barbarossa forging the Holy Roman Empire, and Genghis Khan's conquest of Asia.</li><li> <em>The Conquerors</em> contained campaigns about El Cid, Attila the Hun, and Montezuma, the last one ending before the Aztecs are actually defeated, plus a series of nonsequential missions covering various historical battles like Agincourt, Hastings, Saechon, the Viking colonization of the Americas, and Honnoji-Yamazaki.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElCidPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElCidPloy">El Cid Ploy</a>: The final mission in the El Cid campaign "Reconquista" has the player carrying out the famous ploy; El Cid's corpse is strapped to a horse, and the player must keep him alive until all enemies are defeated to ensure the ruse is successful.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a>: Happens in some scenarios.

The player is intended to forfeit the town and retreat further towards Valencia. You can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> if you are good at kiting and have Count Berenguer's army destroy itself (by having the onagers damage their knights, and then El Cid can destroy the siege weapons alone) and save Denia, but either way you have to leave the town as there is no gold or stone in the area.</li><li> Joan of Arc's fifth mission "The Siege of Paris" is even worse. You're invading Paris, but it's clear you're pretty much outnumbered from the start and will never survive on your own. So you have to wait for the King's reinforcements which...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">number only two men.</a> The rest of the mission is pretty much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapeSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapeSequence">Escape Sequence</a>, oh, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">Joan is captured in the ending cutscene and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">burned at the stake.</a></li><li> In Montezuma's third mission "Quetzalcoatl", you're tasked with defending the weakly defended allied town of Tabasco from the Spanish. However, this happens so early in the mission that there's effectively no way to defend them. Even if you manage to get troops up to Tabasco, it's still scripted to be destroyed. Averted in the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, where there is an <em>achievement</em> for winning the mission while keeping them alive, although this requires both a lot of skill, as well as luck, as you need to act <em>immediately</em> and hope that the Spanish Cannon Galleons ignore the Tabasco Town Center long enough that you can protect it in time.</li><li> The standalone Japanese scenario "Kyoto" begins as a mission to rescue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>, but he is executed before your troops can arrive.

Your objectives then become "Your Town Center must survive" and "Advance to the Castle Age," and soon after you do the latter, a massive Calakmul army spawns and attacks. You're supposed to be overwhelmed so that Calakmul can demand your surrender, leading the player to choose between fleeing Dos Pilas and remaining loyal to Tikal, or taking the historical route and siding with Calakmul against Tikal... but it's fully possible to quickly build a castle, a strong garrison, and research enough techs to hold off against Calakmul indefinitely. The problem is, the Calakmul invaders will continue to be spawned by the game at regular intervals, and your objective will be stuck as "Your Town Center must survive," so there's no point in a heroic defense.</li><li> You start out the second Pachacuti mission, "The Field of Blood", with a sizable brigade of troops and the objective to defeat Anccu Hualloc's army. It very quickly becomes apparent that there's no way in hell you'll manage to do so, since the enemy massively outnumbers your starting units and respawn infinitely. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">Just as soon as the final soldier falls</a>, the real mission begins.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirewoodResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirewoodResources">Firewood Resources</a>: Wood and Stone are represented, respectively, by a bundle of firewood and a pile of rocks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>: Camels are fast and are decent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiCavalry">Anti-Cavalry</a> units, but they cannot take that much damage, especially from spearmen and building arrows.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk">French Jerk</a>: Reynald in Saladin's campaign.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">Friendly Fireproof</a>: Played straight for the most part, but averted with onagers and cannons.

For example, the Russians and Hungarians are represented by Goths and Teutons respectively, because in the original game their more appropriate civilizations (Slavs and Magyars) were not available. The Western Roman Empire in the Attila campaign are Byzantines, though this was fixed in the Sforza campaign as they are Italians there. For some reason the Alans in the Attila campaign are Vikings rather than the more appropriate Persians, probably to prevent the player from facing War Elephants. This was mostly fixed in Definitive Edition as well as minor map errors like the first mission in Barbarossa campaign having Swabia in the wrong place (having them renamed to Lorraine).</li><li> In the first Atilla level, the instructions suggest allying with the Scythians, who are not on good terms with the Romans and might help you fight them, but they ignore the Roman fort and attack Persia. The Romans will refuse to release the Hun captives and say their deal was with Bleda when a unit goes near their fort, even if said unit is Bleda (it was possible to convert him until <em>African Kingdoms</em>, when standard hero attributes were given to his unit).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarrisonableStructures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarrisonableStructures">Garrisonable Structures</a>:<ul><li> Any unit on foot can be garrisoned in Town Centers, towers and castles, although only workers and archers can attack while inside (except the Teutons, whose unique technology, Crenalations, allows infantry to fire arrows).

In <em>The African Kingdoms</em>, the new African maps replace the wolves/jaguars with lions and crocodiles, the deer with ostriches and zebras, the turkeys and sheep with goats, the boars with elephants, and the hawks and parrots with vultures and storks. Likewise, in the new Southeast Asian maps of <em>The Rise of the Rajas</em>, the predators are tigers and Komodo dragons, the large huntables are rhinoceroses, and the herdables are water buffaloes.</li><li> On the other hand, the deer most closely resemble Virginia deer (which as its name suggests, is actually an American species), the wild elephants are clearly Asian despite also appearing in Africa, the rhinos are African despite appearing only in Asia, zebras are not native to West Africa despite appearing there in the Sundjiata campaign, and Komodo dragons only live in Flores and nearby islands (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">smaller</a> monitor lizards do live elsewhere).</li><li> The Saracen Mamluk, despite being named after Egyptian-based Turkic warriors, rides an Asian Bactrian camel. This choice was likely made so Mamluks would be recognizable when surrounded by other camel riders. Still, it is odd to see Mongols and Chinese using dromedaries only while the Saracens have Bactrian camels too.</li><li> The Persian war elephant is an African elephant (possibly of the now extinct North African species given its small size) when it should be Asian. Indian Elephant Archers in <em>The Forgotten</em> used to ride African elephants too because their sprites were recycled, but the HD version changed them to Asian elephants.</li><li> The Incas used to start every game with a turkey - a North American species.

In <em>Age of Empires II</em>, the Cavalry Archers and Galleons were significantly nerfed when it comes to destroying buildings mostly due to the massive increase in building hitpoints, but they are still very deadly and destructive for hit-and-run tactics and raiding villages by killing the civilian units under the right hands. Unless a civilization have access to Cannon Galleons, they will be lousy in water maps because of these issues combined with fortifications dealing effective damage to ships within their range.</li><li> Bombard Towers in <em>Age of Kings</em> deal melee damage, making them very effective against rams. This was changed to pierce damage in <em>The Conquerors</em>, resulting in Bombard Towers dealing pitiful damage to rams' high pierce armor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>: The Random Map AI will always blame anything other than itself when it lost the match.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">Not-So-Harmless Villain</a>: Burgundy spends the first half of the Joan of Arc campaign acting as flunkies for the English armies, and are usually dispatched without too much trouble. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then they successfully ambush Joan during the conclusion of the fifth scenario, leading to her capture, trial, and execution.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">Not the Intended Use</a>:<ul><li> Rams can be used as APCs to transport slower infantry units like the Teutonic Knight. Any infantry loaded into rams will also improve the ram's movement speed and damage. As of the <em>Forgotten Empires</em> expansion, villagers can also be loaded into rams to safely transport them to the front-lines.</li><li> Rams can also attack units. While not much of a threat to soldiers, they can destroy a scorpion or mangonel in one hit, and smash a trebuchet or bombard cannon frightfully fast.<ul><li> This also leads to rams becoming a bit of a counter to archers in archers v archers fights. Without micro, AI archers will prioritize the closest unit. With its high pierce armor, and melee range the Ram can tank for a group of archers, allowing them to take out a much larger group of archer effortlessly, because they will focus fire on the ram to almost no effect.</li></ul></li><li> Luring deer and boars to your town center started as this, but it's such a common strategy now that the updated learning campaign in the <em>Definitive Edition</em> includes it. Luring <em>wolves</em> (or bears, or tigers) to your <em>enemy</em>, however, is more likely going to come as a surprise.</li><li> As said in the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Since you technically aren't attacking <em>them</em>, the AI will never change their stance to you.</li><li> In "Agincourt" (one of the Battles of the Conquerors), you start with a small army, several Monks, no base, no villagers and 80 Wood and 85 Gold. It is possible to convert enemy villagers but, as the level instructions point out, this will only allow you to repair your siege weapons... <em>unless</em> you convert four villagers, have them collect 20 Wood each, then build a farm, which will cause them to deposit the wood in your inventory, giving you enough to build a lumber camp, collect more wood and build a base.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>: Averted for the humans, who this time around have both male and female villagers (in the first game all units were male). All the deer and ostriches, however, are male.<ul><li> In the Spanish version of <em>The Conquerors</em>, Javelina is translated as <em>Jabalina</em>. While <em>Jabalina</em> is the source of the English word Javelina, it means "<em>female</em> wild boar" in Spanish. The Spanish gender neutral name of the American peccari is, well, <em>pecar&iacute;</em> (on the other hand, wildboars and javelinas <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Your villagers will speak out loud the job you just gave them as they go about doing it (e.g. "gatherer" if assigned to a berry bush, "chopper" if assigned to a tree, etc...).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>: One of the Slav's Unique technologies; Druzhina, lets your infantry deal damage to adjacent units. Exceptionally powerful when using groups of infantry. The 'Friendship' part?

Appears in multiplayer as well - constructing a Wonder or collecting all relics essentially makes the rest of the game a protection mission. This is the entire point of Defend the Wonder - multiplayer mode.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender">Purely Aesthetic Gender</a>: From this game onwards, a town center told to produce a villager will randomly make either a male or a female. Males and females do exactly the same work. All regular military units are male, however (except for the Malian Gbeto).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>: Some of the campaigns end this way. Also applies to players who managed to kill wild boars, but lose one of their hunters in the process which definitely hurts early game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Race Lift</a>: One of the more amusing bugs in the game is that an Aztec Monk that's been converted by a non-Aztec civilization will instantly change their appearance upon picking up a Relic. This effect also applies vice versa when a non-Aztec Monk is converted by the Aztecs and then picks up a Relic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfArrows">Rain of Arrows</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbows">Chu Ko Nus</a>, Longboats and castles. Town centers, towers and castles (again) can also shoot more arrows than usual if there is a number of villagers or archers hidden inside; this is taken to insane levels when Chinese players combine both and put Chu Ko Nu in castles.

The unit designers intentionally gave them lower stats to give the other civs a competitive chance in naval battles as the Turtle Ships would've been the most broken unit in the whole game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalRiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalRiff">Regional Riff</a>: Each civilization (and Random) has a unique riff that plays after you choose and confirm them in the Random Map game settings menu. The <em>Definitive Edition</em> expands this further by extending each riff into full-fledged intro themes that play at the beginning of each game like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em>.<ul><li> In addition, clicking on the topics in the History section will play riffs with each civilization getting different songs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReinventingTheWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReinventingTheWheel">Reinventing the Wheel</a>: Technologies are not saved between the scenarios - not even the ages. Society may easily devolve from "Imperial age" to "Feudal age" between scenarios. And in specific cases, you won't be able to tech up to the age you were before, should the mission restrict you in some way. These scenarios seem to stagnate somewhere around Castle Age, even if you were able to somehow reach Imperial in the mission(s) immediately prior.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">Religion Is Magic</a>: Monks can convert enemy warriors and heal their own forces very fast. Montezuma's campaign takes this a bit further - in one mission, a mysterious, unidentified voice grants the player's jaguar warriors tenfold hitpoints if a large enough group is delivered to a certain ruined temple.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyFastConstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyFastConstruction">Ridiculously Fast Construction</a>: Par for the course for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy">Real-Time Strategy</a>. For example, A villager can fill a gap in a town wall by starting construction on a new segment (read: hammering on the ground) for a few seconds, at which point the new wall will be strong enough to seriously impede regular enemy units. Even if it is only partially built, enemies will either have to spend a long time tearing the wall down (taking much more time than it took to construct) or rely on siege engines (only available from the Castle Age) to clear the way for them. A Feudal Age army can be effectively stopped by having villagers half-build a wall along its entire length before the enemies can get around it. What's stranger is that villagers construct buildings faster than they repair them. Averted with towers, which is very time-consuming to build despite their relatively low hitpoints and small size.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>:<ul><li> The final French Mission has you taking the role of Joan's successor and making the English pay dearly for killing their messiah.</li><li> The fourth Aztec mission is based around gathering enough of the scattered Aztec army to force the Spanish and Tlaxcala out of Tenochtitlan. The mission immediately afterwards continues the rampage, focusing on destroying a Spanish and Tlaxcalan fortress to the north.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>:<ul><li> Crossbows in the game are a strict upgrade to normal bows, dealing more damage and having more range. In real life, crossbows would be much slower to fire but could penetrate knights' armor well. This particular aspect would be represented by the Genoese crossbow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScissorsCutsRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScissorsCutsRock">which deals bonus damage against cavalry.</a></li><li> In the second from last scenario of the Montezuma campaign, the Aztecs can gain the ability to use cavalry and cannons by capturing Spanish horses and gunpowder respectively. The scenario notes flat out state that this would never have happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> and was included simply to provide a fun gameplay gimmick. In the very next scenario they can find Korean Turtle Ships, or in <em>Definitive Edition</em> Cannon Galleons abandoned by the Spanish navy, to fight them, which is included for the same reason.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageSetpiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageSetpiece">Savage Setpiece</a>: Large huntables such as boars, elephants and rhinoceroses won't attack villagers unless being attacked, and they are so strong that they need several villagers to take them down. However, they give out a lot of food and have high gather rate, so hunting them is worth it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves">Savage Wolves</a>: During the first mission of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> campaign, the player must buy one tribe's loyalty by dispatching a monstrous wolf named Ornlu, who has been killing sheep and people. Ornlu is a unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">hero unit</a> with stats far beyond those of regular wolves, and can be added to custom maps.

The best counter for them, then, is archers, which are normally easily handled by the Knight line, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesOneToKillOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesOneToKillOne">other heavy cavalry</a>.</li><li> The Gothic Huskarl has absurdly high pierce armor and moves quickly, allowing it to close with and slaughter archer units. They lack melee armor, however, and fare poorly against other dedicated melee units.</li><li> Mongol Mangudai deals bonus damage to siege weapons, bypassing their relatively high pierce armor when massed. This is also helped by their long range and cavalry mobility.</li><li> The Spanish boost to cannonball speed means that it's quite possible for a group of Cannon Galleons to just blast an incoming Fire Ship to pieces before it can get within flamethrower range.</li><li> The Vietnamese Rattan Archer has so much pierce armor that it can win a duel with an Elite Skirmisher, the main anti-archer infantry unit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent">Scripted Event</a>: Lots of them in campaign scenarios.

Gold is the usual determining factor in attrition, since wood is abundant and can be converted at a positive ratio to food and gold can buy stone at the Market.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>:<ul><li> One of the most common tactics in multiplayer is to attack during the feudal age with large numbers of spearmen and skirmishers to prevent your opponent from being able to develop his economy. Most rounds are effectively decided <strong>within twenty minutes</strong> this way. Archers are an alternative, because of their greater attack and the fact they cost no food, so they don't compete for resources with creating villagers. Scouts are also good feudal age units, due to their speed allowing them to harass the enemy's economy effectively. However, they are vulnerable to defensive spearmen. It's even possible to win a match <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCqPGKtPKho">with Skirmishers as the only primary unit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<ul><li> You can even win with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du79SNqvqNY">Spanish Supremacy villagers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (also involving major contributions by a Mongol villager rush).</li></ul></li><li> If you progress to the Imperial Age and are running out of gold, you can try spamming a large number of units that cost no gold, i.e. hussars, halberdiers and elite skirmishers (or whatever your civilisation is capable of producing).</li><li> A frequent online tactic is to play as the Huns, remain in the Dark Ages, and take advantage of the Huns' unique ability, to endlessly spam hordes of Militia before your opponent can get their defenses up.</li><li> An occasional bug in the fourth "Sundjata" campaign can result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Gbetos</a> spawning endlessly after rescuing the Mema Princess.</li><li> As YouTuber Spirit of the Law describes it, the Goth game plan simply involves dogpiling the enemy with Elite Huskarls, over and over again until they submit. Their civilization bonus allows them to pump out (disturbingly strong) basic infantry from Barracks at a staggering rate for reduced cost, at doubled speed with Perfusion. With the Anarchy tech researched, they can churn out Huskarls from those same Barracks as well. In fact, the Goths are designed with such a heavy lean on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> and they fight like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">they have reserves</a> that the best window to counter them is when they're still amassing resources and structures to pour out their flood of units, as once they've managed to hit their stride and reached critical mass, only God can help you. Post-Imp matches against Goth players basically boil down to either them crushing you with superior numbers, or them running out of gold and you bouncing back.</li><li> Taking a page out of the Goths' book, the Malay have this as their whole strategy. They lack several key Blacksmith and unit upgrades (notably the champion) but their civ bonuses let them conserve lots of resources for pumping out more units. Their unique tech, Forced Levy, also makes Militia-line units (the main infantry) cost <em>no gold at all,</em> making them extremely potent in trash wars. Finally, their unique unit, the Karambit Warrior, is quick to train, weak, and only takes up half a population slot, meaning they can easily be massed into a terrifying force by virtue of sheer numbers.</li></ul></li></ul><hr>
