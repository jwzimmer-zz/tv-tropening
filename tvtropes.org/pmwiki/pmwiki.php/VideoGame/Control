It was released on August 27, 2019.</p><p>As a child in the town of Ordinary, Jesse Faden was caught up in a strange and terrifying event that shattered her world, took her brother Dylan away from her, and sent her on the run from the government. After seventeen years of fruitlessly searching for answers for what happened to her and Dylan, a mysterious presence from that event leads her to a concrete skyscraper in New York. There she discovers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction">Federal Bureau of Control</a>, a clandestine government agency <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">charged with suppressing knowledge of the supernatural</a> &mdash; the very same group that took Dylan.</p><p>Unfortunately, her timing couldn't be worse.</p><p>The Bureau is under attack, its Director is dead, and most of its agents are either the same, missing or corrupted by the malevolent, otherworldly force that's invaded the building. Appointed the new Director by a strange entity called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousBenefactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousBenefactor">The Board</a>, Jesse must fight back the "Hiss" as she delves deeper into the Bureau's strange headquarters and history.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If Jesse hopes to survive, find Dylan, and finally get some answers to her past, she'll need to do the one thing she never has ever been able to do. She'll need to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">control</a>, both of the Bureau and of her life&#133;</p><p>The game has two major story DLCs designed to be handled after the main game is completed: "The Foundation," which takes Jesse into the depths of The Oldest House, and "AWE," which represents a new chapter for another much-loved Remedy game: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">Alan Wake</a>.</em></p><p>An Ultimate Edition using cloud-based technology was announced for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> on October 28th, 2020 for release on the same day.</p><p>Previews: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vGiIgnE3f4">Gameplay Trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarlyNamedWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarlyNamedWorks">No relation</a> to the 2007 Ian Curtis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Control" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Control">biopic</a>.</p><hr><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h1><em>Control</em> contains examples of:</h1><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityRequiredToProceed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityRequiredToProceed">Ability Required to Proceed</a>: While Jesse can explore most of the Oldest House as she is, the levitate ability is required to explore much of the later game. The power is the last one to be obtained as part of the main story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bomb</a>: The Hiss Charged explode when they get close to you, or when you kill them. This can be weaponized if you get the ability to Lift human-sized enemies, as you can fling the Charged at other Hiss-infected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>:<ul><li> Jesse shoots, explodes, and generally wrecks dozens upon dozens of Hiss soldiers to get through the Oldest House and take it back.</li><li> Marshall, the head of Operations, is the first person to take the fight to the Hiss, grabbing a bunch of soldiers and taking them to get more HRAs. She's still fighting when Jesse locates her, and keeps doing so. She's also noted to have a habit of disappearing off by herself, often to dangerous locations, but always seems to come back in one piece.</li><li> The Bureau's operatives and security personnel include numerous women, though with the protective suits they're wearing it's impossible to distinguish them from men until they start talking.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles">All Therapists Are Muggles</a>: Zig-zagged. On one hand, the one Jesse went to was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a>, and you can find a recording in which she's struggling to make sense of what younger Jesse's telling her. On the other hand, the Bureau has numerous medical personnel, including psychologists, for their employees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>:<ul><li> Ahti, almost quite literally, as he's a janitor Jesse encounters on the building's first floor. For one, he's still working (and alive) even though the building is in a state of lockdown; for another, he can control the elevators appearing and disappearing; he also is apparently unaffected by the Hiss Invasion despite not wearing an HRA, and finally, he reacts to Jesse's internal monologue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later it's revealed that he's able to access parts of the Oldest House that other employees don't even know about, and can even set up makeshift Control Points. His true nature is never revealed, though he remains on Jesse's side to the very end. Some of his dialogue, such as his insistence on Jesse being his assistant, comments regarding vacation, threatening an unknown 'them' in regards to both, implies he is on the same level if not above the Board. He's also heavily implied to be the Finnish god of the same name and is apparently buddies with the Old Gods of Asgard.</span></li><li> To a lesser extent, Jesse herself. The instant she arrives, she's promoted to Director, and is everyone's boss. Despite this she's still running around fixing everything personally. Either by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">accident</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">foresight</a>, one of the first doors you encounter right after you get the Service Weapon / Directorship is locked by a Lv.1 security clearance... which Jesse, who (again) <em>is everyone's boss and now runs the Bureau</em>, does not have because there are no spare keycards.</li><li> This is taken to absurd degrees when you reach Containment, where you can accept a side mission where a Ranger apparently has access to a Lv.<em>9</em> keycard &mdash; the highest Jesse can get in the base game is Lv.<em>6</em>. This is like if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">Mulder and Scully</a> somehow changed the password to the Cigarette Smoking Man's laptop.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>: Underplayed in the Old Boys' Club mission, where Jesse and Marshall try to restart the HRA production. As soon as they fight their way to the production plant and figure out how to activate the machine, a crucial component breaks, necessiting that Jesse return to Maintenance to get more of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>: The AWEs - or, at least, some of them - can be created by both ancient myths and modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a>. One document even implies that the FBC is deliberately spreading more urban legends to foster creation of AWEs it desires, and they're revealed to be the secret backers of the paranormal enthusiast radio show "America Overnight".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome">Amulet of Concentrated Awesome</a>: Objects of Power are basically this. A person who binds one gains the same ability - more or less - as the one the OoP possesses on its own. Other than the Service Weapon, examples include:<ul><li> A diskette that lets you use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Launch</a>.</li><li> A merry-go-round horse that lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Evade</a>.</li><li> A safe that lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitingParticleShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitingParticleShield">Shield</a>.</li><li> An X-Ray light box that lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Seize</a> your enemies.</li><li> An old television that lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">Levitate</a>.</li><li> An ashtray with a cigarette resting on it, which generates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarrchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarrchitecture">a winding maze which resembles a 1950's era hotel</a>. This is the only Object of Power which Jesse doesn't bind, and instead makes up the Ashtray Maze in the Research sector.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Despite Jesse defeating Dylan and shutting down the Projector, the Oldest House is still locked down and Hiss are still present, leaving Jesse to continue the fight against the Hiss until they're completely cleared out of the FBC.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>: A few side quests reward Jesse with new outfits, such as a gold suit from winning the roulette wheel in the Luck and Probability department, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> Asynchronous Suit from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss">Mirror Boss</a> esseJ in the Self-Reflection side quest</span>, and a janitor jumpsuit from completing all of Ahti&#146;s tasks. You also get two outfits for beating the game: the standard FBC women's outfit of short-sleeved white blouse, black slacks, and black pumps; and a "Director's outfit" that is a dark-blue version of the gold suit with Jesse having a pinned-up hairstyle.<ul><li> The Foundation DLC has a mission where you collect 8 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManekiNeko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManekiNeko">Maneki Neko</a> statues. Finding them all grants you access to the club room where you are given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEaredHeadband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEaredHeadband">cat ear headband</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: There are several that this game provides.<ul><li> Firstly, your ammo automatically reloads for you by "charging". This makes gameplay not only more convenient, but fast-paced, without having to worry about having to find ammo clips.</li><li> Do you have low health? Can't find any element to pick up? No problem! Simply backtrack and any element that dropped from enemies that you killed earlier will still be there until you quit the game.</li><li> When you prepare to Launch something, you normally grab the object you're aiming at. If you're not looking at any grabbable objects (highlighted by a white border), Jesse will simply rip a chunk of concrete from the floor or wall. There's very clearly a bit of rebar sticking out of it, too. Which is a bit jarring if you do it in the Astral Plane, where everything is made up of smooth stone that is definitely not reinforced concrete.<ul><li> If an enemy throws/shoots an explosive near you, using Launch will grab it without having to aim at it, even if it's out of view. Timed explosives also won't detonate while you're holding them.</li></ul></li><li> For people wanting to stream or Let's Play the game, there's an option to turn off copyrighted music to avoid copyright strikes.</li><li> A patch introduced Assist Mode to the gameplay options menu. Here, you can activate a better aim assist, adjust how much damage you take, how potent health pickups are, ammo recovery rate and delay, and even give yourself immortality and one-hit kill shots. Surprisingly, this doesn't disable achievements.

The first Safe Room you open contains a person possessed by the Hiss.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a>: The Board has a Confusing/Annoying habit of lacing their Messages/Orders with Ambiguous/Contradictory/Absurd word associations. Do their Untranslatable/Otherworldly communications make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a>, or just ambiguous entities from another plane? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">Yes/Yes</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameDashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameDashing">Videogame Dashing</a>: Evade lets you quickly dash across short distances. It can also be done after jumping, and while levitating. Timed right, it can be used to break long falls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility">Visible Invisibility</a>: Hiss Distorted only drop their invisibility cloak a split-second before they launch their devastating shockwave attack, and reengage it almost immediately afterwards. Fortunately, paying close attention to the lingering Hiss haze in the air still allows one to keep track of their movements, although this usually only works if they're the last enemy in the area due to how well they blend in with the background.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion">Voice of the Legion</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dylan</span> speaks in half a dozen voices when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Hiss is talking through him.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>: The first fight with Tommasi is the first one you can't win simply by running around and shooting, forcing you to learn some basic strategy. His attacks hit <em>hard</em> and are undodgeable, forcing you to take cover to avoid them. He can't be taken down before the Service Weapon needs to recharge, so you need to keep a close eye on your ammo. The few mooks that spawn are closer to a help than a hinderance thanks to the health pickups they spawn. And because he's the first Hiss Elevated you encounter, you learn to quickly correct your aim when he dodges to one side or another.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">Warp Whistle</a>: Jesse can teleport between Control Points &mdash; and not just in the Fast Travel "She's going to make her way to the location through means we just aren't going to bother showing" way, she <em>explicitly describes herself as teleporting</em> when talking with Pope. According to Pope, this is an unprecedented ability.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>: Every single Hiss mook you fight, even the weirdest-looking ones, was a normal FBC employee mere days or even hours before you run into them. Considering that the "kill 1,000 Hiss" achievement usually pops around halfway through the game, it's best not to think about the horrific toll in human lives the Hiss exacts on the FBC simply by being there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the AWE DLC, there is no mention of the Board at all throughout the DLC despite Jesse having issues with them being a big point to the Foundation DLC.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: From the AWE DLC, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> we have several lines implying that Alan Wake set the events of <em>Control</em> in motion, up to and including creating the Hiss as a substitute for the Dark Presence, so that Jesse can presumably help him escape from the Dark Place.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhisperingGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhisperingGhosts">Whispering Ghosts</a>: The Hiss' non-violent victims are talking all the time, though it's difficult to decipher what they're saying, let alone understand it, because they all talk over each other and slightly out of sync. As the Oldest House is filled with them, their mumbling is a near-constant presence unless you shoot them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHorror">Word-Salad Horror</a>: The Hiss' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">Madness Mantra</a> is essentially a weaponized form of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHumor">Word-Salad Humor</a>: The Fra Mauro AWE features what may or may not be an alien that talks this way. Cheerful, friendly, completely incomprehensible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">World Tree</a>: The Board has dialog that implies the Oldest House is this, calling the Foundation of the House its "Roots". Fitting, given that part of the inspiration for this game is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves">House of Leaves</a></em>. Files from Dr. Ash corroborate this, as he finds diagrams that look like the Tree of Life and he theorizes that since New York used to be a forest, it was unlikely the Oldest House took the form of a Brutalist-style skyscraper in ancient times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok">Wreaking Havok</a>: The Launch ability lets you throw random objects around willy-nilly, and environments have an impressive amount of destructibility. Large-scale fights are liable to leave the room completely trashed. If you unlock Launch all the way, you will be able to throw what is described as 'large' objects, which includes propane-powered forklifts. Suffice to say you <em>don't</em> want to throw one of <em>those</em> at an enemy which is too close to you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Yank the Dog's Chain</a>: In the Panopticon, Jesse comes across a man who has been watching a fridge, unable to move or look away due to the fact that something bad will happen if he looks away, and has been there for over a day due to the Hiss incursion. Even Langston forgot about him. Jesse, meanwhile, is in the middle of finally tracking down her brother's location, and on top of that needs to clean up an altered item wreaking havoc on the same floor, so she can't immediately help with the fridge problem. When you do get the ability to help him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he looks away from the Fridge for long enough that he's turned into a red stain on the concrete by the time you get into the room.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">Year Inside, Hour Outside</a>: Downplayed. One collectible mentions that time passes differently between the Astral Plane and our world, so video taken from astralnauts' dives can last longer than the time they spent diving in the real world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">There are posters on the walls stating that this change in time perspective doesn't count as overtime</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">You Are in Command Now</a>: Jesse is basically appointed to be the new Director of the FBC after the previous one is found dead, despite her never having been a part of the organization. She's also rather confused how all of the FBC staff seem to accept her without question, especially since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they kidnapped her brother.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">You Are Number 6</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dylan claims that Trench and Marshall</span> told him that his only name is P6.<ul><li> Completing this section of the story gets Jesse an outfit for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her number, P7</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">Your Head Asplode</a>: This is how the Astral Spike first manifested in our reality, killing an astralnaut by emerging from his head &mdash; you can even find a recording of this event in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the section of Containment devoted to the Ordinary AWE.</span></li></ul><hr>
