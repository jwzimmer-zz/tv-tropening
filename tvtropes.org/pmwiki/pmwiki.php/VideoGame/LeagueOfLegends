The lore has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">developed in a massive way since then</a>, employing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> that wrote out the League entirely in favour of focusing upon the living tales of individual characters and entire nations that populate Runeterra. The ongoing lore is now primarily communicated through <a class="urllink" href="http://universe.leagueoflegends.com">Universe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an extensive encyclopedia website; as well as written stories, artwork, comics, animations, and special character interactions.</p><p>Unlike the Champions who start each match at Level 1, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> Summoners are persistent and gain experience with every battle.

However, <em>LoL</em> has many distinct differences from <em>DotA</em>, most of which simplify the game to some extent. Riot Games pushed it heavily as a professional e-sport, and it has long since eclipsed the original <em>DotA</em>'s popularity. Like we said: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/728786/league-of-legends-is-the-most-played-video-game-in-the-world/">most played game in the world<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>The game has two playable modes, each between two opposing teams of up to five players:</p><ul><li> <strong>Classic:</strong> The standard mode of play as described above. The two maps available for this mode are Summoner's Rift, a 5v5 three-lane map in the same style of DotA's map, and Twisted Treeline, a smaller two-lane map for 3v3 matches.</li><li> <strong>ARAM</strong>: "All-Random, All-Mid", which was originally a fan-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRule">House Rule</a> of Classic Mode where players would agree to use random Champions, only employ the central lane and were not allowed to return to their base until death. This created a highly-aggressive game based more around direct combat than map control. It was later canonized into an official mode and given a unique map: the "Proving Grounds", later revised into "The Howling Abyss".<p></p><div class="indent"><em><strong>Thirty seconds until tropes spawn!</strong></em></div></li></ul><p>On top of this, in November 2013, Riot started releasing "temporary game modes" that are only available for a limited time. Riot has a "Rotating Game Mode" queue that opens at a somewhat sporadic schedule from Fridays to Mondays, with specific game modes being available for play on a rotational basis. These game modes include:</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotating Game Modes&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Definitely Not Dominion:</strong> Known simply as <strong>Dominion</strong> in its original incarnation. A capture-and-hold game where players must fight over control of five "capture points" on the map. The Nexus is not attacked directly, but damaged over time depending on how many points are controlled. Champions start at Level 3 and gain gold and experience far more quickly than normal, leading to a more action-packed match. The dedicated map for this mode is called "The Crystal Scar". This was originally one of the three main game types alongside Classic and ARAM, but was discontinued after four years in February 2016 <a class="urllink" href="http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion">due to a lack of interest<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Ironically</a>, fan outcry about its removal eventually saw its inclusion in the Rotating Game Mode queue. Riot remastered the assets, did a few tweaks, and added it to the rotation.</li><li> <strong>One for All:</strong> A mode that operates exactly like Classic, except each team is made up of five copies of the same champion. Only three champions were permanently vetoed: Karthus (five of his ultimate ability hitting at once would be unbeatable), Syndra (so many orbs), and Teemo (so <em>many</em> mushrooms).</li><li> <strong>The Showdown:</strong> A 1v1 or 2v2 skirmish on a modified version of the Howling Abyss map. The winner is the first player/team to draw First Blood, destroy a Tower, or kill one hundred enemy minions. Oh, and whoever wins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">dances as Victory is declared and the whole bridge floods with happy Poros.</a></li><li> <strong>Hexakill:</strong> A 6v6 war that completely upends the standard meta of the game. As of autumn 2014, has been played on both Summoner's Rift and Twisted Treeline.</li><li> <strong>Ultra Rapid Fire</strong>, or <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">U.R.F.</a></strong>: Announced on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> 2014 as "the future of LoL", this mode grants a global buff to all players that allows them to spam abilities to a ridiculously overpowered degree. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. This game mode made a return in 2015.</li><li> <strong>One for All Mirror Mode:</strong> A variation of "One for All" that pits <em>ten</em> of the same champion against each other on the Howling Abyss map.</li><li> <strong>Doom Bots of Doom:</strong> A Co-Op vs. AI mode which pits regular players against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> bots. These "Doom Bots" not only have incredibly unfair versions of their regular abilities, but gain randomized bonus abilities taken from other Champions or made exclusively for this mode. A later remake turns this into a sort of survival mode, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedDevil">Little Devil Teemo</a> as the final boss.</li><li> <strong>Ascension:</strong> A modified version of the Dominion map, where two teams of five must move through an even thicker fog of war to capture relics. At the center of the map is the boss, a stationary Xerath with a high level of health; whoever kills him Ascends themselves, becoming highly buffed until the enemy team manages to kill them. Points are awarded for champion kills and relics captured; first team to 200 wins.</li><li> <strong>Legend of the Poro King:</strong> A Snowdown-exclusive 5v5 skirmish on the Howling Abyss where the usual Summoner spells are replaced by two poro-specific abilities: firstly, the ability to throw a companion poro at enemies (and to dash to an enemy afterward) and secondly, to dash to the side of the Poro King, whom you will summon once your team has landed 10 poro hits on enemy players. The Poro King is a giant poro who proceeds slowly down the map, healing your team and doing damage to your enemies (tanking turret blasts and thrown enemy poros too) until he is dispelled.</li><li> <strong>Nemesis Draft:</strong> A variation on Summoner's Rift Draft Mode, where instead of picking your own champion's, you pick the enemy team's. Cue a <em>complete reversal</em> of the usual tactics, as players try to ban out the perceived worst champions and give the enemy team the most awkward champions and comps they can come up with.</li><li> <strong>Black Market Brawlers</strong>: Originally added as a part of the <em>Bilgewater: Burning Tides event</em>. In this game mode, many different items from the "black market" are also available for sale, some with very dramatic effects. Additionally, you can spend Krakens, a currency unique to the game mode, on Brawlers, unique mercenary creatures that follow minions down a lane. Subsequent Krakens spent can upgrade your Brawlers to give them unique effects. After it ended, one of the unique items, the Dead Man's Plate, was added to regular gameplay to memorialize the event. It has yet to pass through the Rotating Game Queue, but it's on it's way.</li><li> <strong>Nexus Siege</strong>: A time-attack competition where the Attacking team attempts to destroy the Nexus of the Defending team as quickly as possible. The two teams then switch sides, and whoever gets the best time wins. Both teams can buy special Siege Equipment to help their side, such as tower-destroying cannon placements for the Attackers and tower-buffing super-lasers for the Defenders.</li><li> <strong>Hunt of the Blood Moon</strong>: A deathmatch gamemode where only very aggressive and squishy champions, mostly Assassins, are playable. The first team to reach 350 points wins, and points are gained by killing enemy champions, hunting enemy spirits in their jungle, or killing the Demon Heralds that spawn in the Baron and Dragon pits. If one champion gets three kills in a row without dying or returning to base, they gain Demon Brand, which turns them invisible and causes their next attack to deal true damage. It's a huge deathmatch where everyone is a glass cannon.</li></ul></div><p>On June 25th, 2019, Riot released another mode, <strong>Teamfight Tactics</strong>, inspired by the popular <em>Autochess</em> mod to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em>.

Pressing the key will display the reticle, and releasing it will cast the skill.</li><li> When a player disconnects, his or her champion will simply walk back to base (rather than stand still and wait for something to come kill them). You're still stuck with a lower max number of players, but it can prevent a cheap death by standing idle in front of an enemy turret. (<em>DOTA 2</em> took notice of this and upped the ante by having an AI-controlled bot take control of the disconnected player).</li><li> The First Win of the Day bonus resets every 20 hours rather than the normally-expected 24 hours, giving you much more leeway in getting the bonus every day without having to worry about schedule slipping.</li><li> The in-game shop has an undo button to fully refund purchases within a limited window of time. This handily eliminates the age-old dilemma of buying the wrong item and having to choose between being stuck with the wrong item or losing valuable gold selling it back for less.</li><li> Season 4 introduced a new item system which implemented a few changes for convenience:<ul><li> The trinket system was added that allowed players to pick up either gain free wards, scout out an area of the map from far away, or disable stealth. This, combined with the 3-per-person limit on wards, alleviated the all-too-common problem of the support player being the only one on the map placing any wards at all.</li><li> For support characters, players could choose one of three starter support items that increased gold income, carefully designed (mostly by causing the effects to stop working temporarily if they kill a minion, the usual method of gold income) to let supports gain a gold stream closer to their teammates, partially addressing a complaint that the role was less fun due to their inability to buy worthy item upgrades.</li></ul></li><li> As of pre-season 6, player vision wards now automatically upgrade, since players often forget anyway. Also, all players receive the "Homeguard" enchantment at 20 minutes, rather than having to buy it.</li><li> Pre-season 11 introduced a major overhaul to the item store layout, allowing inexperienced players to better understand their build paths for any given scenario. Among the changes were updating major weapons to succinctly describe their function for any given champion (Liandry's Anguish for "Anti-Tank", Duskblade of Draktharr for "Multikill", Goredrinker to "Survive Burst", etc.), and making the "Recommended" tab update based on enemy compositions. It also implemented quick-buy sidebars for universally-desirable consumables and boots for convenience.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>: Any champion with an ability that Silences enemies (incapable of using abilities, cancels currently channeling ones, etc.) can do this. No crowd control lasts for more than a couple of seconds, but casters are rendered nearly helpless for the duration, making it feel very long indeed. Naturally, the few specialized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">Mage Killer</a> champions have this in their arsenal plus other abilities to capitalize on this vulnerable period.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: The League is host to several of pairs of champions who would love to see each other dead.

The bots on Beginner are notoriously poor players, running into towers without minions and rarely going back for more health. This is however justified given how they still <em>regularly</em> beat new players. The Intermediate bots, on the other hand, are a whole order of magnitude more difficult, ganking weak champions and making much better use of their abilities &mdash; and yet they <em>still</em> make stupid decisions like chasing "weakened" champions all across the map while their lane stays wide-open.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a>: As to be expected for a regularly-updating game by a development team that regularly interacts with the community, <em>many</em>.

Attack! Attack!</a>: It depends on the situation, but in a lot of cases, blindly attacking is a bad idea. "Pushing", or clearing minions as fast as possible to get closer to the enemy tower can leave one in a vulnerable position to get ganked as it's easier to kill someone that has to run all the way back to their tower. However, given adequate ward coverage and map awareness to protect against approaching enemies, pushing the lane can be a <em>good</em> thing as it makes it harder for the enemy to farm with their tower damaging creeps<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3nvf5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3nvf5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3nvf5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Less true in higher divisions and especially pro play, where everyone's last-hitting mechanics are so excellent that only a very few champions are seriously hampered by being kept under tower &mdash; unless they're in a 1v2 situation, especially as a melee, where every minion kill has to be weighed against the possibility of taking a third of your health or more in free harass, even when under tower</span> and ensures that they can't leave their lane to help out elsewhere without losing the tower.

Marksman characters, though, revolve around Critical Hits, since their safety at range and allies defending them typically means they can rack up multiple critical strikes from a safe distance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a>: Most champions can be classified in terms of where they fall on the bully-carry spectrum. Those on the "bully" side are very strong on early game but become useless coming late game, and those on the "carry" side are the opposite: very weak on early game, but after enough gold grinding and the chance to nail some kills they become unstoppable powerhouses. Competent bully players will capitalize on their early game strength to prevent the enemy laner from becoming strong and outscaling them, whereas competent carry players will play defensively, hold out against the enemy champion, and try their best to grind the gold required to scale into late game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>:<ul><li> If you happen to be a purveyor of multiple MOBA games, it can be frustrating to instinctively hit "D" or "F" to get out of a bad situation only to realize that, no, you do NOT have Flash at your disposal. Similarly, getting used to certain configurations for item hotkeys (especially with the addition of Trinkets) can lead to screw-ups like hitting "4" to place a ward and accidentally using your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Blink Dagger</a> prematurely.</li><li> French players also have to consciously remember when discussing with English-speaking players that their keyboard mapping turns QWER into AZER and the attack-move key from A to Q.

Originally, League was just a fun game with campy characters, pop culture references, and enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> to bleed the nose of the Pope. When Riot decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">start over</a> with the lore and make a clean slate, things changed. Blatant Fanservice, while still continues in fun skins, was toned down in base champion appearances. Pop culture references became limited to in-game jokes, and newer champions started acting in much more serious and complex ways. Compare older champions who haven't been updated yet to one released or updated since the retcon, and the divide is really noticeable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-zags in a lot of ways</a>.

These champions arguably are a bit different from most ranged attack-damage-carries due to them needing to close the gap to hack away at you somehow, but their build paths are a bit more varied as they can also build tanky if needed or all damage they feel like it and are doing well because of it. But naturally, being close up without enough items to sustain said damage output carries some risk compared to the ranged carries.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a>:<ul><li> Knockback abilities tend to work like this.

You can block off your enemies from escaping... or do the same to your own allies.

If the enemy team is trying to take the objective in large numbers, this will almost certainly be death for the instigator (since most abilities that might be used to escape are used to get close in the first place). If the gambit succeeds though, it's more than worth it since the enemy team will obtain 450 gold (Split across the team) for one kill while the player's team will get the bonuses for slaying Dragon or the Baron.</li><li> Tower-diving, especially when it's early on the game and <em>very</em> risky. If it can be pulled off, the diver gets a kill and demoralizes the enemy by showing that they can just walk into their safe zone and finish them off.

Riot often talks about messy "spaghetti code" hidden in older champions, relics from a time before they had the expertise and technology they do now. They've taken to giving champions significant updates, which can vary from simple cleaning up of the code under the hood, to entire rereleases where an old champion is remade from scratch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>: Every range of the spectrum &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Fire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Water</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Air</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Earth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Darkness</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Light</a>, and more &mdash; is represented through the many, <em>many</em> champions.

It would be unthinkable, however, to change the Bloodthirster or Infinity Edge swords into bows or guns since they've stuck in the minds of millions of players already.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrappleMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrappleMove">Grapple Move</a>: Several champions have a "pull" ability which can grab and stop enemies, derailing their positioning and putting them at a massive disadvantage to capitalize on.

The jungler, instead of laning, goes through the forested areas in the middle of Summoner's Rift, leveling by fighting the neutral creeps that live there. In addition to freeing up his (meant-to-be) lane partner to gain his share of G and EXP, he also gets to create ambushes, or 'ganks' with his (in-lane) teammates. The jungler can also 'invade' or initiate incursions into the jungle on the side of the enemy, to steal resources from the enemy jungler.</li><li> Illaoi is also a possible aversion thanks to her ult, which spawns a tentacle for every enemy it hits. Since her tentacles can put out massive amounts of AoE damage (and heal her with every strike) Illaoi is the one champion practically <em>designed</em> to fight large numbers of enemies at once (she was the first character designed in the Juggernaut category after it was properly codified). Of course, she'd still <em>prefer</em> to have backup, but a fed Illaoi <em>can</em> potentially fight almost the entire enemy team at once on her own if they lack the burst to kill her quickly enough or the CC to lock her down.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjuredVulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjuredVulnerability">Injured Vulnerability</a>: In a sense, being low on health makes one particularly vulnerable to the numerous "execution" abilities in the game (those that deal more damage if its target is low on health).

The reason the <em>interface</em> is awesome is that it shows and allows you to purchase not only your current item's ingredients, but displays what items it goes into as well, allowing you to simply bring up the item you are ultimately planning to build, and just buy the pieces one by one as you gain the necessary cash.</li><li> Outside of the battlefield, there's a Hextech Crafting system that allows players to get champions and <em>skins</em> just by playing the game. How it works is that you get Hextech Chests by playing games and earning at least an S- rank (this can only happen 4 times a month and only with different champions), and they can be unlocked using Hextech Keys, which can be formed using 3 Key Fragments that randomly drop with every win (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">or you could just buy both of them</a>).

Riot has taken note of how cumbersome it is to type some important messages (particularly if one is already under attack) so they implemented "smartpings" so calling "missing", asking for help, etc. can be done much faster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>:<ul><li> In a constantly-updating game with an already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">staggering roster of playable champions</a> with the design intention to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">each one play and feel unique from each other</a>, newer champions are usually given new mechanics that can help distinguish them from others, but may also seem scary to introduce simply due to their mechanical value in the form of utility that may counter a few existing characters (such as Cassiopeia and Poppy being able to block dashes or Yasuo being able to block projectiles), or their design to be a counterpick to a vast amount of what the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a> suggests (such as Talon and Zed being AD melee assassins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">in the midlane typically occupied by AP caster mages</a>). This trope has always been kept in mind during champion development as to prevent unstable balance (hence Riot's tendency to nerf strong champions rather than buff weaker champions), but typically when a champion with meta-challenging mechanics are introduced, they will almost assuredly not be considered adequately balanced until the next patch <em>at the very least</em>.</li><li> Perhaps the most notable case of this was the balance controversy of Irelia, who was designed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">mobile assassin-bruiser,</a> which during the time of her creation, when most champions were either straight tanks or burst mages, was something risky to design for, but necessary for the game to evolve. Riot's solution was to overload her kit with an absurd amount of elements which would be considered excessive even by today's standards (Innate tenacity and lifesteal, an easily-to-reset gapcloser/damage nuke, true damage and point-and-click crowd control), which not only ended up frustrating players having to play against her due to how initially overpowered she was (as she could easily build into a tanky DPS who dealt massive damage and was unkillable), but also frustrated the balance team due to her kit now being a numbers nightmare. She wasn't considered balanced until a plethora of nerfs during Season 1 (hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/LeagueOfLegends">"better nerf Irelia" meme</a>), and she now exists as a reminder to as to never design such an innately overloaded champion again.</li><li> One definite place of evolution in this regard is mobility. When <em>League</em> first came out, the game was much more "decisive" and based on larger macro play, with actual combat skewing more towards point-and-click abilities and stats. As the game developed, characters have found new means of being "expressive" and based more on player mechanics, resulting in more targeted skillshots and the increasing paradigm of mobility, allowing champions to make significant micro-movements within fights, though usually at some kind of risk (long cooldowns, tied-in utility, need for on-kill resets, etc.). Nearly all new champions (and even several older champions following gameplay updates) have some kind of movement spell, which causes a bit of chaos when put against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">those who were made for the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">old, non-mobile paradigms</a> (the entire marksmen class in particular has to deal with this issue as their draw is largely on point/click-based auto-attacks). The debate on whether those left behind should get up with the times and find new ways to combat mobile champions, or new champions should avoid being mobile at all is a continuous one, but it's widely accepted that mobile champions are usually much stronger (or at the very least, more versatile), hence their prevalence in high and pro levels.</li></ul></li></ul><!--* <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal'>Power Crystal</a>: Some items with crystal in their name can be seen as this.

This was eventually retconned to make Tristana and Poppy yordles as well, with female Yordles having a "Megling" appearance and male ones having a more furry or hairy appearance.

Whether or not this makes them more <em>viable</em> for gameplay is debatable (and fans do debate it very often) but the undeniable fact is that many champions released have more utility or options in their abilities. Riot is countering this with remakes of champions with comparatively flat kits that are completely outmatched by newer ones.</li><li> A more literal example are champions/team compositions that reign supreme one season then fall out of favor the next because of the cycle of nerfs. A good example is the "Holy Trinity" of ADC's (Corki, Graves, Ezreal) that dominated season 2 but have been equaled or surpassed by other carries' popularity in season 3. This isn't necessarily because of power-creep but more of Riot wanting to keep their game dynamic instead of falling into complacence.</li></ul></li></ul><!--* <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongsInTheKeyOfPanic' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongsInTheKeyOfPanic'>Songs in the Key of Panic</a>: The Howling Abyss features this; as towers fall, the music gains pace and more instruments start playing.--><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">Spirit World</a>: The Spirit Realm adjacent to the realm of mortals, while it hasn't been directly explored as its own location, in many ways is just as important as the rest of the human world of Runeterra given just how often it seems to interconnect. Several traits of the realm:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent">Spirits from it come in all shapes and forms</a>.

While described as largely nonphysical and abstract (and as such has never been canonically visualized), it's also said to have several distinct "locations" where certain spirits take up residence over others.

Typically, they can't be countered by Tenacity and the amount of time stunned cannot be reduced, but the durations don't last very long.</li><li> Pull: Some champions such as Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Kled and Pyke have "hook" abilities that not only stun the target, but usually brings them towards them in some manner.</li><li> Suppression: Effectively the same as Stun, but can only be removed using Quicksilver Sash. Additionally, while the target is affected, <em>so is the user.</em></li><li> Stasis: Usually a self-inflicted buff/debuff that causes the user to be unable to attack/move, but will become completely invulnerable. This exists in champions such as Bard, Lissandra and those Devoured by Tahm Kench, as well as from the Zhonya's Hourglass item and its component Stopwatch item.</li><li> Entangle: Exclusive to Amumu's ultimate, which causes the target to be unable to move or auto-attack, but they can still use abilities.</li><li> Sleep: When applied on an enemy, it first marks them as "drowsy" for a moment, gradually slowing them before they properly fall asleep.

If we're laning opposite each other and I kill you, I get a Gold and EXP advantage, not only from ganking you but because you then have to spend upwards of 75 seconds out of the fight (dead, respawning, traveling back up the lane). This G and EXP advantage lets me gain new equipment and abilities with which to repeat the process. When the page refers to a Champion getting "fed", it means that s/he was the beneficiary of this vicious cycle... and because it only has to happen two or three times for the advantage to become insurmountable, the match can be all but over within ten minutes. However, a small relief is that champions on a 3+ kill spree will yield an extra gold bounty upon being killed (referred to as being "shut down" by the announcer). It's not much- it caps at 200 bonus on top of the usual 300 for really, really fed enemies- but it helps.<dl><dd><ul><li> And to help further, while base kill gold only goes to the killer, everyone on your team gets a bonus if one of you shuts down an enemy, and if you die multiple times without getting kills you start giving less gold to the enemy, normally 250 but can be dropped to 150 at 3 consecutive deaths.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> In general, when a team has a large gold lead collectively (more kills, farm, and objectives) or controls more of the map (more towers destroyed and more wards placed) the game is very much in their favor. While mistakes do happen that can turn the tide of battle (a common example being getting caught out of position then getting yourself if not your teammates, allowing the enemy to counterattack while they have the numbers advantage), they are less and less likely the higher one goes up the ELO ladder. Most high-tier teams will capitalize on leads as hard as they can so that there's a little room for error as possible, making many games a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> as to who will win after seeing the gold counts as early as 12 minutes in.

The consumable "Neeko's Help" item is implied to work by having Neeko shapeshift into an extra copy of one of your allies (though Neeko herself also appears in Set 2 and Set 3).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam">Gathering Steam</a>: A trait of some characters, items, and traits.<ul><li> Units with Guinsoo's Rageblade, the Set 1 Wild synergy buff, or the Set 4 Duelist synergy buff gain extra attack speed with every attack.

Several champions also behave this way on an individual level&mdash;Shyvana in Set 1 gained attack damage and attack range after using her ultimate to transform into a dragon, Jinx in Sets 1 and 3 needs to get two takedowns to reach her full power each fight, Olaf from Set 2 gained attack speed, lifesteal on basic attacks, and immunity to crowd control upon using his ultimate, Syndra and Aurelion Sol from Set 3 gain increasing damage instances with each time they cast their ultimate each fight, and Kayle from Set 3 gains damaging waves of fire on her basic attacks for the rest of the fight after using her ultimate. Somewhat uniquely, Zed from Set 2 had the potential to form armies of copies of himself (since his clones could also make additional clones through their own ultimates), provided he and his clones weren't focused down before that could happen. Set 3.5 Urgot took a different track: his ability WILL kill its target, and reduces its mana cost each time he does so.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">I Work Alone</a>: Set 1 and 4 Yasuo's unique "Exile" trait triggers only if he's not adjacent to any ally when battle starts, giving him a shield that essentially doubles his health.

Space Pirates in Set 3 instead grant a 50% chance for Space Pirates to grant 1 gold from champions they kill, with the 4-piece bonus letting them occasionally loot item components instead. Set 4 Fortune grants bonus orbs at the end of a victorious combat, akin to the ones you receive from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> mobs&#151;the longer you went without a payoff while having the trait, the stronger the orbs you finally get on a victory become.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>: Set 1 Gunslinger synergy gives their attacks a chance to strike multiple targets at the same time. Set 3 Blaster synergy instead causes every fourth attack to fire multiple bonus targets at once.

All of the origins were replaced with new elemental-themed ones, most of the classes (except Assassin, Blademaster and Ranger) were replaced as well, almost the entire champion lineup was replaced, several of the handful of champions who <em>weren't</em> replaced (such as Rek'Sai, Yasuo, or Volibear) were totally redesigned, and the items were shaken up considerably. Additionally, an extra row was added to the map to make it larger overall, and a new mechanic was added where certain squares on the map would manifest an elemental fountain which could be used to buff any champion placed on them at the start of a round.</li><li> Season 3, <em>Galaxies</em> (starting in March 2020), does the same, completely upsetting the champion lineup to a new set themed around the sci-fi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> skin lines (Odyssey, Star Guardian, Dark Star etc). It also replaces the elemental hexes with variant modes called Galaxies that appear in some games.<ul><li> Averted with Season 3.5, which merely replaced some champions and traits with others while reworking a few other traits.</li></ul></li><li> Season 4, <em>Fates</em> (starting in September 2020), replaces the sci-fi look with a spiritual one, with the Chosen mechanic (2* champions in the shop that have bonus stats and one double trait bonus) replacing Galaxies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a><ul><li> Set 1 and 2 Veigar's <em>Primordial Burst</em> instantly kills its target if they're at lower star level than Veigar, unless they're protected by Kayle's <em>Divine Judgement</em> or Kindred's <em>Lamb's Respite</em>.</li><li> In season 2, if you could get a copy of Lux to 3 stars, her <em>Final Spark</em> would do 99999 damage to all enemies hit, which is a guaranteed kill (and Kayle was removed, while Kindred uses a different ability for their spell this time around). Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">this is really just in the game for laughs/bragging rights as it's (almost) completely impossible to get a 3-star version of Lux</a>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">Tier SEVEN</a></li><li> Many Set 3 4-cost and 5-cost champions approach this when three-starred&mdash;every fourth basic attack from a 3 star Jhin deals 4444% damage every fourth basic attack he makes, Cho'gath can deal 2000*AP magic damage that can become true damage with a set bonus, a 3 star Miss Fortune deals 999% max HP as magic damage over its duration, a 3 star Ekko deals 2000*AP magic damage to ALL enemies during his timestop, and Gangplank's ultimate deals 9001 damage in a very wide area he can make bigger with certain shop upgrades. (Other 4-costs and 5-costs tend to lean more towards much higher sustained damage or absurd utility effects.)</li><li> Urgot already does this!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">Percent Damage Attack</a>:<ul><li> Sets 1 and 2 Vayne's <em>Silver Bolts</em> work just like in the main game, dealing true damage based on her target's max health on every third attack.</li><li> Red Buff and Morellonomicon both apply "burn" status on opponents hit with, respectively, basic attacks or spells, causing them to take percent-based damage over time and reducing their healing. Set 1 Pantheon's <em>Grand Starfall</em> behaved similarly, dealing percent max HP magic damage and applying a healing-reducing percent-based burn. Set 3 Miss Fortune deals (rather high) <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> percent magic damage with her ultimate, while Set 3.5 Viktor deals percent magic damage on the first hit of his ultimate. Set 4 Kalista and Sett also have percent magic damage on their ultimates.</li><li> The Giant Slayer item caused your basic attacks to deal an extra 12% of the target's remaining health on hit. It formerly dealt 5% max HP true damage on hit. At present it averts the trope, though it still fills a similar role as an anti-HP item.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEqualsRarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEqualsRarity">Power Equals Rarity</a>: Higher-tier champions only start appearing in mid-to-late game and almost always have higher stats than their low-tier counterparts, but they're also much harder to upgrade.<ul><li> Chosen in Set 4 are rare, snap picks that you can obtain that come as two stars, get bonus stats, and have one of their trait bonuses count double.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a>: In Season 3, tier 5 units have their abilities spike to <em>impossible</em> levels of power if you can get them to 3 stars, such as Xerath's Abyssal Bombardment going from a duration of 8 seconds and a damage of 440 to a duration of <em>45 seconds</em> (longer than an entire round) and a damage of <em>2500</em> (before AP scaling), or Thresh pulling <em>your entire bench</em> onto the battlefield to join your forces. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">getting a tier 5 unit to 3 stars is basically completely impossible</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Rare Random Drop</a>: The Spatula is an item that has a small chance of dropping during PvE rounds and sometimes on special carousels. On its own, it does nothing, but it can be combined with another item to create unique equipments that grant additional traits to champions wielding them, mirror their attacks against another target, or allow them to bypass the unit limit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus">Set Bonus</a>: One of the core concepts of this mode. Each champion possesses two or three traits, describing their race or origin (Demon, Noble, Yordle, etc) and their gameplay role (Assassin, Guardian, Sorcerer etc). Deploying several champions sharing a trait grants a unique bonus that can apply to either one of them, all of them, or the entire team (even champions without said trait).<ul><li> There are two Set 1 origins that each only appear on a single unit and are therefore effectively extra passive abilities for them: Robot (Blitzcrank, gives him full mana at the start of the battle to let him open up by using Rocket Grab) and Exile (Yasuo, which gives him a shield equal to his HP if he starts the battle not adjacent to any ally).</li><li> In Set 2 there is one single-unit class<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7drwo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7drwo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7drwo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lux's Avatar class is also unique to her, but rather than giving her an extra ability it instead causes her to count as 2 units towards her elemental origin, which is randomly selected from the elemental origins that other players haven't bought yet when you roll her in the shop and kept as her current element if you've already bought a copy of her</span>- Alchemist, which appears only on Singed and causes him to play like he does on Summoner's Rift, running around blindly spreading poison gas over everyone instead of attacking.</li><li> Set 3 Starship works like Singed's passive, but with a different AI (and mana gained over time that Aurelion Sol uses to launch a fleet of warships in a manner vaguely resembling a Protoss Carrier.) Additionally, Gangplank and Miss Fortune had the unique Mercenary class (which allows you to spend 8 gold to upgrade their abilities, similar to how you can spend Gangplank&#146;s Silver Serpents on Summoner's Rift), while Janna has the unique Paragon class, which does nothing for her directly, but instead enhances her entire team to cause Star Guardians to deal true damage with their basic attacks and all other allies to deal magic damage instead.</li><li> Set 4 has a number of unique traits at Tier 5&#150;Sett&#146;s The Boss, Azir&#146;s Emperor, and Kayn&#146;s Tormented, with Yone having a pseudo-unique he shares only with his low-cost brother Yasuo. It also features the Chosen mechanic, which allows Lux-style super versions of a trait by letting you occasionally find stronger versions of a champion with a double trait.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDeath">Sudden Death</a>: If any fight lasts more than 30 seconds, the "URF Overtime" kicks in, granting all units massive damage and attack speed buffs, while also reducing crowd control duration and effectiveness of healing. However, if battle is stil going 15 seconds later, it simply ends in a draw and both participating players take damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.
