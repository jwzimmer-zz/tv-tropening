The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> reason for the items in Tantal being more expensive than anywhere else in Alrest is that Tantal is in poverty due to its isolationism and the Titan's own internal climate being ill-suited to growing crops, forcing them to rely on a black market for their economy. However, even after you improve Tantal's economic crisis through side quests and merc missions, the items you can buy at the shops are still very expensive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>:<ul><li> The latter half of chapter 4 deals with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tora finally resolving his father's disappearance.</span></li><li> Part of the first half of chapter 7 features <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nia coming to terms with her Flesh Eater Blade nature and revealing it to the party.</span></li><li> Pretty much every non story Unique Blade has their own Heart-to-Heart and/or sidequest that further explores their personality.</li><li> The final mercenary rank-up quest has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Raqura and Roc in prominent roles</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> The feeling of helplessness when dealing with a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> loved one with suicidal depression</span> and not knowing what to do about it makes up the bulk of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rex and Pyra/Mythra's relationship and the main plot as well</span>.</li><li> The fear and pain of outliving the people you care about is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> what ends up not only something that the heroes contemplate in detail, it also is revealed to be the driving motivation of all of the main antagonists</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCalendar">Alternate Calendar</a>: In Chapter 3's opening, Pyra gives the date as "Amathatober 5th, 4058."

It takes him a second to think of something.<div class="indent"><strong>Rex:</strong> I'll punch him in his stupid face... then probably get a drink with him or something. That's the sixth rule of the Salvager's Code: first have a punch-out, then drink to forget. Then the friendship's all set. I'm not old enough to drink, though.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnEconomyIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnEconomyIsYou">An Economy Is You</a>: The economy of Alrest is in a steep recession as the game begins, since Titans are dying and harvests are getting worse each year. This translates in gameplay to high prices and poor item selections at shops, but you can personally take it upon yourself to fix the economy by spending all that gold you get from adventuring. Here's how:<ul><li> Some Titans (Argentum, Gormott, Uraya, Mor Ardain, Tantal, Leftheria, and Indol) have a Development Level, shown as a one- to five-star rating in the shop menu. As you buy and sell items at stores on that Titan, complete Merc Missions, and talk to the townsfolk, the Development Level rises.</li><li> As the level rises, you can take special Merc Missions to increase the selection at various stores. Get the full selection available and buy at least one of every item in any shop (excluding Core Chip, Accessory, Salvaging, and unique shops), and there will be a deed of ownership available the next time you visit that shop.</li><li> Buying these deeds gives all your characters very useful and permanent passive buffs, such as increasing your running speed and item drop rates. The shopkeepers' dialogue will change to reflect the fact that you are now their boss. Lastly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating">many NPCs will thank your party personally</a> for singlehandedly stopping the decline of the global economy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory">Another Side, Another Story</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game takes place simultaneously with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, with the same event having created the world as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> being fought at the exact same moment.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>:<ul><li> Defeating a Unique Monster permanently kills it. You won't be harassed when revisiting the area, and by examining the grave, you can have a rematch without having the struggle with the spawn conditions all over again.</li><li> NPC party members will hold off using their special combos until you order them to, preventing AI from wasting their specials.</li><li> Players can keep track of debuffs thanks to the debuff timer at the top of the screen.</li><li> Blade affinity milestones that are finite or liable to become empty grinding (like landmarks discovered or distance walked respectively) are counted retroactively when possible.</li><li> Kora's Blade Quest requires you to have a higher total for the Girls' Talk skill than is possible for even a fully maxed out Mythra and Kora. To complete the quest, you <em>must</em> have at the very least two other blades with Girls' Talk and Kora, Mythra, and one of those two blades must have a maxed out Girls' Talk rating. The feature that makes this easier is that, of the three optional blades with Girls' Talk, two of them (Sheba and Praxis) require no luck to obtain; they are both attainable through sidequests, and both of the sidequests needed to obtain them can be done well before you enter Tantal, where Kora's quest is. Additionally, the final blade, Vale, is of the dark element, which has a relatively small pool of rare blades, meaning through the use of Justice cores, she's not <em>that</em> difficult to obtain.</li><li> NPCs with a star on their speech bubble still have new stuff to say. For anyone who want to exhaust all their dialogue, this is very useful.</li><li> Sidequest objectives are marked if they can only be completed at certain times of day. Additionally, collectables required for a current quest will be omitted from crafting menus.</li><li> At the end of Chapter 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pyra is very temporarily removed from the party. If the player's been too clever by half anticipating an upcoming boss and Engaged another Blade in her slot, the game will quietly put Pyra back in her proper slot.</span></li><li> After Chapter 8 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Indol falls</span> all of the stores and sidequest important NPCs (save for quests that specifically begin in that area) from that area move to other Titans across the world, avoiding becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>.</li><li> An NPC introduced in a Season Pass quest addresses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> related to Premium Cylinders mentioned below- after completing the quest, he can manufacture Premium Cylinders for free, provided the player gives him the appropriate materials.</li><li> For those who find points in the game too difficult, Patch 1.3.0 adds Easy Mode, which can be switched into in the games settings.</li><li> Patch 1.3.0 also adds the ability to "lock" Blades, preventing you from accidentally releasing them and pinning them at the top of the Blades submenu, making common Blades with useful field skills quicker to find.</li><li> Patch 1.3.0 adds a Bard in several towns in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> that sells valuable items in exchange for Bonus Exp, presumably so that any Exp obtained upon hitting level 99 doesn't go to waste. The one in Argentum sells one extra accessory slot for each character. The Bard in Torigoth sells bundles of 20,000 Ether Crystals in exchange for Bonus EXP for those who aren't very good at Tiger! Tiger! Fonsa Myma's Bard sells Legendary Core Crystals, cutting down on farming. The two more notable bards are one Alba Canavich that sells Ultimate Weaponry, which is otherwise only obtainable via Completing a Unique/Rare Blades Affinity chart. The other is in Tantal, which sells Overdrive Protocols, which are only obtainable via a few chests, completing a driver's Affinity chart, releasing a 4-crown Common Blade with a complete Affinity Chart or through item gifts given to those who bought the Expansion Pass.</li><li> Patch 1.4.0 adds more Bards that sell Poppi's Elemental Core: Light and Master Role mods. Combined with the Stat II and Fast Blade Switch V parts that can be purchased for Noponstones in the Land of Challenge expansion, Poppi can now be completely maxed out without needing to play the final stage of Tiger! Tiger! until the parts randomly drop.</li><li> Patch 1.5.0 adds the option to turn off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand">Action Command</a> system in combat (aside from the press needed to continue the next phase of a chain attack,) so you can sit back and watch all the flashy moves and explosions (however, this results in the game treating the attacks as if the button presses gave only a "good" rather than "excellent" rating, thus lowering your damage output compared to what can be achieved manually).</li><li> Patch 1.5.0 adds an option to turn off enemy hostilities, meaning that enemies that are within your level range or higher won't automatically attack you if you get near them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>: Core chips are created through concentrated ether which is then refined and purified. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Indoline Praetorium has been forcing the Tantalese government to absorb Genbu's ether for 500 years.

Notable with tank blades (Especially Tora) who sometimes get <em>so</em> focused on tanking that they won't even run to get the potion that's <em>right there next to them</em> - assuming you or our third ally will pick them up. It's generally advised that, unless the player were to take on healing duties, that your "healer" <em>only</em> use Healing Blades, or to place the non healer blade in the third slot that they rarely swap to.</li><li> Your AI-controlled party members are also not very good at avoiding environmental hazards, and unlike the first game, will continue to attack an enemy with Spike, even if the resulting damage will kill them.</li><li> When you get the ability to have your Drivers use three Blades, the Blade you put into the third slot will often be the lowest priority, (Tora's an exception for most of the game) so if you were to say, give your tank a healing blade and put it in the third slot, they will not use it even when the party obviously needs healing.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Tyrannotitan Kurodil has a unique art called "Bonecrusher" that hits behind it and deals tremendous damage, encouraging the player to avoid approaching it from the back. The AI often does not take this into account and will continue to stand behind it as it rapidly drains their health.</li><li> If the player-controlled character and one other go down in battle, the remaining AI character will always move to revive the player first even if the other one is much closer to them and may well be the team healer. If the player character isn't revived after enough time, the battle automatically ends as a loss.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: In the first Xenoblade game, the Tirkin were relatively minor enemies who occasionally popped up as required enemies to defeat in some NPC quests.

However, those three are not the hardest superbosses in the game. That honor belongs to Gladiator Orion, who is barely 1 level over the level cap.

In battle, Sheba has a battle skill that increases damage for every female characters in battle (not including herself), and another that increases damage for every coin collected in battle. When fighting several enemies at once, this means that her damage can increase drastically for every enemy defeated, and doing this with a team of mostly female fighters can quickly give her an absurd damage multiplier. Even against single enemies, she isn't entirely powerless since her level 3 special has a high chance of dropping coins.

What's he gonna do, eat her?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chapter-by-chapter, this sentence unravels from a joke to a legitimate fear; Amalthus is one of the big bad guys and <em>someone who did, in fact, eat a Blade, likely against their will</em>.

You obtain both of them during the events of the story (the former when attempting to disperse an ether miasma in Gormott and the latter during the fight against Bana and Muimui in the Old Factory), but most if not every cutscene afterwards will depict neither of them. Sure, Rex will use Roc's scythes in Spirit Crucible Elpys, but Roc himself won't appear.</span></li><li> There are several times when you're trapped somewhere for various reasons, such as your party being swallowed by Uraya's Titan. Most of the time, you can fast travel elsewhere just as you could any other time. A particularly egregious example of this happens in Chapter 2, while rescuing Nia and Dromarch from the Ardainian ship. After busting both of them out of their cells, there's nothing stopping you from hopping back to Argentum to shop. However, if you want to trigger the boss fight and move on to the next chapter, you HAVE to keep exploring the ship and exit through its main entrance.</li><li> A number of post boss battle cutscenes will show the boss having a clear advantage over you, despite their defeat just moments ago.</li><li> Due to Pyra's sharing half of her life force with Rex, she does not regenerate from injuries automatically unlike other normal blades. And even normal blades can die if their core crystals get destroyed, the tactic which various characters use during cutscenes. Yet, in gameplay battles, Pyra and normal blades cannot be targeted by your and enemies' attacks, nor is Pyra at all impeded by injuries Rex suffers during gameplay battles.</li><li> It's established in early cutscenes that Pyra can melt her way through solid metal doors with relative ease, and that Rex's hookshot can enable the party to traverse large gaps with a bit of time and effort. It's also established Drivers and Blades alike can leap substantial distances/heights without a problem. However, in actual gameplay you'll often need to have lots of field skills interacting with each other to perform similar feats, not to mention the times when the only way to get through a mundane door is to find the key.</li><li> In the latter half of Chapter 7, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nia is shown fighting in her Blade form throughout the rest of the chapter, despite that in gameplay you could have set her back as a Driver</span>.</li><li> When Jin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">briefly rejoins the party in Morytha</a>, he simply reuses his player character model and artwork from the beginning of the game.

However, in gameplay this fails to stick, and you have to activate the form the usual way.</span></li><li> Doing early game sidequests with additional party members can lead to them showing up in cutscenes but not doing anything. Of note is Vess's recruitment quest, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">M&ograve;rag</span> and Zeke will just awkwardly stand in the background while Rex, Nia, and Tora enjoy some dumplings. Electra's Blade Quest is even worse in this regard, as it's the only one that can potentially have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vandham</span> in the party, but since the quest itself takes up a good portion of the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">M&ograve;rag</span> and Zeke will show up towards the end of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeke will even mention watching Electra growing up before his eyes even though he probably wasn't even there if the player summoned Electra early enough.</span></li><li> A sidequest involves following a nopon named Foorara as he travels around Alrest. Finding him in one area and talking to him will cause him to move to the next area, where the process will be repeated until he comes back in Argentum where he started. After meeting him in Mor Ardain's Hardhaigh Palace, Foorara's next location will be Indol. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If the player didn't find him in Indol before it becomes inaccessible in chapter 8, then he will instead be found in Mor Ardain's port, claiming to have fled Indol. Problem is, it's entirely possible talk to him in Hardhaigh Palace AFTER Indol gets destroyed. So Foorara will express his desire to visit Indol... and then immediately go to the port, claiming to have fled a Titan that had already sank to the bottom of the cloud sea at the time</span>.</li><li> Rex's hookshot is apparently long enough to salvage from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the World Tree itself</span> but not long enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cross the gap separating him from Pyra/Mythra in the ending cutscene</span>.</li><li> Lampshaded in the production notes detailing the new Blades added by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> mode; it acknowledges that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you'll be able to acquire the Torna Blades as allies while they're still enemies in-story, which totally wrecks the story</span>, but since this is a repeat playthrough it doesn't matter.</li><li> The city you visit on each of the continental Titans is usually noted to be the biggest or "main" city on that Titan. However, it is likewise often noted or implied that there are other towns and cities on a given Titan, you just don't have reason or opportunity to visit them. The disconnect come in how often you can explore such a large portion of a given Titan's body that its hard to imagine where there would be enough room for these extra towns and cities to even conceivably be located (Mor Ardain has its right shoulder, and Gormott has its left shoulder, but Uraya and Tantal seem completely explored).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameWithinAGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameWithinAGame">Game Within a Game</a>: The Tiger!

Argentum's floating titans are noted to maniplulate the ether in the atmosphere in order to achieve lift, and since ether density decreases the higher in the sky one goes, there is a limit to how high they can fly (them having to achieve a balance between staying low enough for the titan to get enough ether, and high enough to be out of range of the monsters in the Cloud Sea that will harrass their titan).

There are many obstacles in Alrest that require certain field skills to overcome, or various collectible zones to gather items where field skills can improve one's results.

A common blade with nine circles' worth of field skills may actually be worth keeping around for some time.</li><li> For 4-crown Common Blades, it's the stat boosts they give to their Drivers. The maximum stat boost of Rare Blades is 15%, while 4-crown Common Blades can reach 24% stat boosts. Strength, Ether, Agility, and Luck are highly sought after.</li><li> Those seeking KOS-MOS would consider Justice to be the number one priority thought cloud stat.

Of course, neither Rex nor anyone else on Alrest has any concept of an artificial habitat bigger than a ship, such as a space station, which could only be habitable if there were people actively keeping it that way. Thus Rex's plan was doomed: Elysium turned out to be a ruin with no way for the residents of Alrest to resettle it. Had it not been for the Architect's last gift, everyone on Alrest would have ultimately been screwed (assuming the remaining continental Titans would have died before any new ones produced would have grown enough for habitation).</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>: The game treats boarding the Maelstrom in Chapter 1 like this, requiring you to confirm you're ready to an NPC.

A number of quests that don't start in Indol still require you to go there, but those requirements will just be moved elsewhere following chapter 8. Shops will be moved to other areas as well. Affinity charts that require doing unique actions all around the world (such as Floren's Beguiling Charms and Perun's good deeds) will still have enough of the required things in the rest of the world to complete it.

There are a total of 15 blades sorted into 5 columns that can be obtained through the pity method, and your save file determines which 3 of those 15 that you are guaranteed to get.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>: Happens in Chapter 8.

Finally, it establishes that unlike what Xenoblade Chronicles implied, the experiment did not actually erase the universe, but instead created or shunted Klaus (or at least half of him) and his female partner to a different one which is where the first game took place; the old universe continued to exist, though all life on Earth was apparently sent away to other dimensions.

While Pyra observes this is not necessarily a bad thing as it means they aren't burdened with bad memories, a late game conversation reveals the party's Blades would prefer dying entirely. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is eventually revealed that blades, with the possible exception of the Aegises, are not truly immortal (though effectively extremely long lived). Assuming their crystals are not at some point destroyed, they eventually become titans which birth more blades, and the titans they became eventually die of old age. Also subverted with Flesh Eater blades and Blades bonded to Blade Eaters. Flesh Eaters can live for centuries but their human side eventually causes them to die. Blades bonded to Blade Eaters have their lives linked to the Blade Eater and will die for good when the person implanted with the piece of their Core Crystal dies. In Rex's case this turned out to be a link that Pyra/Mythra could break at will, being the Aegis, but for other blades like Pandoria this probably isn't the case (not that Pandora minds as she quite likes that no one will ever replace Zeke and that she will be able to pass on with him).</span></li><li> There is extra nuance in the late game conversation where Nia asks this question in an attempt to better understand Jin's pain. Rather than forever, the question is more about if any of the Blades want to be able to "extend" the lives of their current selves rather than be replaced by new incarnations. The Blades quite unaminously agree that the idea of outliving their Drivers does not appeal to them, wanting to keep the relationships they have separate from that of any future incarnations, and in as much as the end of their current incarnation counts as death, they consider it acceptable compared to the alternative. For her part, while she no longer is suicidal, Pyra believes much the same regarding not wanting to outlive her Driver, wishing that she will one day be able to die alongside Rex.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel">Womb Level</a>: The people of Uraya and Tantal live inside their Titan's stomachs.

True enough, Mythra outright gets visions of meeting Rex just as she is about to unleash all her power upon Alrest and possibly destroy it all, said vision being enough for her to get herself back under control, though the accumulated energy is still released and causes much devastation.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>:<ul><li> At the start of the game, only Lora is capable of pulling off Level 4 specials where Driver and Blade constantly pass each other their weapon. After all, she pretty much invented what would become a staple of Blade combat by the time of the original game.</li><li> Thanks to the updated gameplay mechanics Blades are now much more directly involved in battles, performing not just buffs and specials but regular attacks, as well as being able to be targeted by enemies (though not when in the rearguard position). This arrangement (minus immunity when in the rearguard) is present in cut scenes in both games and is often important to the events in the story, but didn't apply to actual gameplay in the main game outside of battles where a Blade's driver was not present.</li><li> After discovering Torigoth has been burned to the ground and Lora's mother killed, Lora will be somberly silent when you use collection points in the area, instead of giving her usual cheery remarks.</li><li> Once Lora <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">officially becomes a knight of Torna</span>, Jin takes off his mask. Not only from his model, but also his menu screen, and even the Save icon. Lora's medal also permanently appears on her model.</li><li> Mythra's final, hardest to acquire skill, requires a maxed out Community level. It's a single level of Girls' Talk. The game itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">points out that it does absolutely nothing</a>, but it symbolizes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> rather nicely, showing her finally getting off her high horse after meeting so many people. Speaking of, all of her field skills match the ones that she has in the main game, whereas other familiar blades such as Brighid and Aegaeon have different ones. This is because Mythra's consciousness hasn't been compromised in between the two stories while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brighid and Aegaeon are both reverted to core crystals upon Hugo's death in the finale</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>:<ul><li> Equipping Mythra with the Massive Melee Mythra outfit will have her core missing the X-shaped piece that is given to Rex in the main game, even though this is set centuries before it.</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> mode, you have the entire party available for the entire play-through, no matter who is supposed to be in your party story-wise. Especially jarring when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hugo and Milton die and you are still able to use Hugo and his Blades in the battle against Gort, with the final game save still listing Milton in the party.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a>: Partway through the Gormott arc, Jin cuts off both of Gort's arms, with only a shot of his prosthetic arm flying off. After that, the camera avoids showing his freshly cut stump. Indeed it avoids showing his lack of arms at all, using continuous close ups as he runs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch">Gut Punch</a>: The ending. If you played through the main game before this one, you knew it would be bad, just not how bad.

In the game, it is mentioned that Uraya conscripted them and dropped them off in Torna. However, conscription (also known as the draft) refers to compulsorily inducting someone into a country's military. If the militia had truly been conscripted, that would have made them members of the Urayan military. Thus, sending them to Torna without the latter's consent (which had clearly not been given) would have been an act of war. The game implicitly acknowledges this when Hugo comments that he cannot take his flagship &mdash; which is a Mor Ardainian warship &mdash; to Torna. The proper term for Uraya did is probably "expelled" or "deported."</li></ul><p></p></div><p></p><hr>
