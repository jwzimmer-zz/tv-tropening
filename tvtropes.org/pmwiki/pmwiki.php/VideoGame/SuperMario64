Miyamoto was also tapped to direct a sequel to the game, but an incredibly long period of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> burned him out from the position, and after the title was cancelled, he quietly stepped down from the director's chair for good. Today, he mainly serves as a producer and advisor at most, not just for <em>Mario</em>, but for Nintendo as a whole, generally leaving the directorial reins to various other members of Nintendo's staff. Miyamoto's involvement with <em>Mario</em> in particular would decline over time: by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>, he would primarily act as more of a figurehead for the franchise than an actual creative guide.</p><p><em>Super Mario 64</em> was later brought back to usher in Nintendo's first <em>portable</em> 3D system as <em>Super Mario 64 DS</em> in November 2004 (December 2004 in Japan; February/March 2005 in the PAL region). This version brings the total star count up to 150 from the original game's 120, shifts some of the original stars around (while removing others<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0h8n6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0h8n6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0h8n6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically replacing those stars which were simply placed at a point in the level with no further context.</span>), adds a few new levels and bosses, includes multiplayer, and has three additional playable characters (Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario).

You can climb it forever if you don't have enough stars, but the staircase itself is not actually very big. (The game accomplishes this by seamlessly warping Mario back down a few steps when passing a certain point<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ohpd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2ohpd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ohpd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is made clearer by the map screen in the DS remake showing the character icon resetting back on the map</span> - meaning the bottom of the stairs is always right behind you; however, since the game only checks your <em>forward</em> motion, a series of backward long jumps can scale the "infinite" staircase without any problems.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyShortLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyShortLevel">Absurdly Short Level</a>:<ul><li> All three of the Cap courses are very short levels, the Tower of the Wing Cap in particular, as it only consists of a large platform and coins floating in the air, which can be collected for a star in mere seconds by a reasonably skilled player.</li><li> The Secret Slide level is very short, basically being a straight line to a Power Star. In fact, the game subtly encourages a player to finish it as quickly as possible, as doing so will earn the player a secret second star.</li><li> The aquarium sub-level in the room housing Jolly Roger Bay's painting is likewise very brief, only consisting of a very small course where you just swim for 8 red coins.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bomb</a>: Upon running near the Bob-ombs or picking them up, their fuse goes off and you have a limited time before they blow up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>:<ul><li> Bob-omb Battlefield; Dire, Dire Docks; Lethal Lava Land; Rainbow Ride; Shifting Sand Land.</li><li> This applies to all the level names in the German-language version of the game; examples include Atlantis Aquaria (Wet-Dry World) and Piratenbucht Panik (Jolly Roger Bay). Therefore, some of them sound very weird to outright nonsensical, like Bibberberg Bob (Shivering Mountain Bob), Frostbeulen Frust (Frostbite Frustration), Fliegenpilz Fiasko (Fly Agaric Mess) or Wobiwaba W&uuml;ste (Wobiwaba Desert; the first word doesn't mean anything).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientTomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientTomb">Ancient Tomb</a>: The pyramid in Shifting Sand Land has a tomb that is home to the level's boss, Eyerok.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antepiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antepiece">Antepiece</a>: The game uses several of these. For instance:<ul><li> The castle's Secret Slide level (easily accessible from the lobby) is a very short and easy challenge, as the slide has barriers around most of it that keep you from accidentally falling off &#151; the only "challenge" imposed on the player is a sharp turn and a brief part of the slide with no barriers midway through. Even then, the slide doesn't penalize you for losing by taking away a life &#151; it just sets you back in the lobby. Later on, you encounter two more slide levels in Cool, Cool Mountain and Tall Tall Mountain, respectively, where the training wheels come off and you're forced to do slides over bottomless pits, with no safety barriers and plenty of sharp turns &#151; one of them even has you race a penguin! The first slide is also an indicator that there are many more secret stars hidden in the castle, including one hidden in itself &#151; a second star appears if you beat it in less than 21 seconds, which is tricky for beginners, but far from unfeasible, and it allows you to practice before the aforementioned penguin race in Cool, Cool Mountain. On top of all that, the slide has 80 total coins, and getting 50 nets you a 1-up upon getting its stars, on top of a 1-up riding along the middle part of the course, encouraging the player to practice getting used to the slide's physics.</li><li> The Tower of the Wing Cap and The Secret Aquarium likewise prep you for the task of practicing flying and swimming, respectively, two aspects of the game with fairly high learning curves, by placing you in obstacle- and enemy-free environments where your only goal is to acquire Red Coins, which you can replay at any time, and the former doesn't penalize you for failing. Likewise, the Cavern of the Metal Cap and Vanish Cap Under The Moat missions are set in environments where you can freely test the abilities of the Metal Cap and Vanish Cap, since going out of the cavern or falling out of the level in both won't penalize you either.</li><li> Before King Bob-omb gives the idea that you have to pick up and throw him, players can discover that the same trick works on his Bob-omb minions earlier, giving a hint on how to best him ahead of time. Even King Bob-omb himself is a warm-up for later in the game when you have to grab Bowser by the tail and swing him around, something he actually admits upon defeat.</li><li> Whomp's Fortress has three of these; first, a series of moving walls (Bomps) that just push you off the first ledge of the level's main route and onto the nearby ground, which is a warmup for the moving platforms above a bottomless pit straight ahead. Just after that, you'll find a small bridge that collapses as soon as you run across it, positioned at a height that isn't particularly dangerous for Mario (and getting back up there to retry takes merely seconds). It's a low-risk challenge on its own that you can skip via a thin ledge nearby, but it preps you for a similar collapsing bridge in Big Boo's Haunt, which is even smaller, locked in a tricky camera angle, and on top of that, sends you straight into the basement if you fall off it, forcing you to backtrack all the way back upstairs. Finally, you encounter Whomps shortly before you fight the Whomp King, which show his attack pattern, although they are much smaller and easier to dodge than him, and only take one hit to kill.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: Given it was one of the earliest 3D games, and thus had to accommodate newcomers not familiar with its then-revolutionary mechanics, the game has a very relaxed learning curve, and quite a few generous features to make the game fairly easy and accessible for players;<ul><li> The players are allowed to progress through the game at their own pace and go after most of a level's stars in any desired order, if one particular star is proving too difficult to get in a level. Because a few of the game's stars are tricky or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">just plain cryptic to find</a>, the game allows you beat it with just 70 minimum, with the other 50 being completely optional. The game occasionally gives you hints about stars or the existence of the magic caps.</li><li> The castle hub world (and some of the levels) are generously filled with tutorial signs, which cover every general aspect of the gameplay&mdash; and aside from a handful of text boxes at the start and at other sporadic points, the game never forces the player to do a tutorial, instead allowing them to play around and get accustomed to the game's controls and flow on their own time.</li><li> As long as you're not moving, airborne, or swimming in a level, the game will allow you to pause and quit back to the hub. Some parts of the game (namely, the secret areas of the castle) won't cost you a life if you lose at them.</li><li> If you collect a 100-coin star in any level, grabbing it will not send you out of the level, and it will allow you to save your progress on the spot, retaining the star if you die.</li><li> The game teleports you out of a level as soon as you grab any other star and refills your health, allowing players a chance to quickly access another star or reset the level without dying for a shot at a specific challenge that they messed up on, such as the aforementioned 100 coin challenge.</li><li> 1-Ups in the game are plentiful and easy to acquire, such as the hidden 1-Ups on the castle grounds which reset each time you go inside the castle, or the fact that getting 50, 100, or 150 coins in both a normal or secret level (e.g., the slide) will always get you an extra life upon beating it.</li><li> Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land, two of the trickier levels in the game, will start you right back in their sublevels if you died in them and you reselect the mission you were playing right after, saving you from having to re-enter the areas from the outside sections of the levels. The Bowser levels will also land you right back outside the entrance to his arena if you lose to him rather than kicking you out of the level.</li><li> Any reasonably deep body of water in the game, be it the lake of Jolly Roger Bay or the small pool at the top of the big Tiny-Huge Island, will quickly refill your health if Mario jumps in and stays at the surface- this is a consequence of the underwater air and health meters being the same. Coins, which are extremely plentiful, will also refill your health, as do the occasional floating heart, which refills your health if you run through it quickly enough.</li><li> The game has several generous ways to keep you from getting hurt from a high fall; If you fall from too great a height, diving forward or ground pounding <em>just</em> before you hit the ground will keep Mario from getting hurt. Cool, Cool Mountain, Shifting Sand Land, and Snowman's Land have ground mostly made of soft snow and sand, so you usually won't take damage from a high fall in them (you'll just get stuck in the ground for a few seconds and pop out). Shooting yourself out of a cannon will make Mario immune to fall damage as well (unless you bump into a wall and start falling normally&mdash; <em>then</em> you're in trouble). And the Wing Cap will protect you from fall damage if you're in flight, and even if you aren't, you can tap the A button to flap its wings, which will slow down your fall enough to protect Mario.</li><li> The Bully enemies need to be knocked into lava to be killed, spitting out a coin. To keep you from having to lava dive each time this happens, the coin is programmed to spit out and arc toward you. So long as you're not too high up (which can be a problem in the volcano in Lethal Lava Land), the coin will almost always land safely on a platform for you to collect.</li><li> If you happen to collect a Star that isn't above solid ground i.e. a 100-coin star spawned after collecting some midair coins) to land on, it'll seem like you fall to your death and can't complete the collection animation by landing. However, the Star will be counted and you won't have to go through the trouble again.</li><li> The draw distance for Red Coins is <em>much</em> farther than normal coins, making the player able to spot them from a distance.</li><li> Mario normally needs to be running to execute a triple jump. The Wing Cap requires that you do a triple jump to fly, however, while wearing the Wing Cap, you can triple jump without moving forward and putting yourself at risk.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmlessBiped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmlessBiped">Armless Biped</a>: MIPS The Rabbit has no arms or paws, only two big feet.

Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land are even generous enough to put you right back inside their sub-level if you lost a life inside them and you select those levels again right away (although subverted if you're trying to get 100 coins, as it resets that counter). The Bowser levels also put you back just outside the entrance to his arenas if you lose a fight against him.

The only ones that remained the same were Snowman's Land and Tick Tock Clock. Interestingly, while "Rainbow Cruise" was renamed Rainbow Ride, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros.

This created a loophole which allowed Mario to regain health simply by jumping into water and coming up for air.</li><li> The game was more non-linear. While a certain amount of stars are needed to access the game&#146;s later levels, and while you could select a particular star to pursue within the levels, the game would generally not actively prevent you from going after other stars. Selecting certain stars would sometimes make changes to the world that makes a star accessible or inaccessible, but you could otherwise get most of the stars in a level in any order. Starting with <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, whatever mission was picked had to be done, and could not be bypassed (save for the occasional levels with secret stars in them). It would take until <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, 21 years after <em>Super Mario 64</em>, for a 3D Mario game to do this again. Also, the star missions in <em>Mario 64</em> lack introductory cutscenes, which renders their locations less obvious (bar, at times, the missions' titles).</li><li> The 100-coin star could be collected without having to leave the level, meaning you could get the 100-coin star and another star in the same run. In <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, you had to leave after collecting the 100-coin shine, as it would end the level the same way a regular star/shine mission would. The <em>Galaxy</em> games make the 100-coin star an actual mission and used purple coins instead of the yellow ones used in <em>64</em> and <em>Sunshine</em>.</li><li> Some of Mario's moves from this game are missing in later ones, most notably the ability to punch and other physical attacks on command.</li><li> In some respects, the game was an instance of Early Installment Weirdness for much of 3D gaming. For a lack of other games to compare with, entire levels quite visibly hanging in the middle of nothing were perfectly fine back then, but would have been considered signs of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a> mere years later. It was also very cubic, even by later N64 standards, and thus unusual in a series that tends to prefer round shapes whenever possible. Again, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> would revisit this, including the Mushroom Kingdom itself being inexplicably on a floating island.</li><li> The game has a much lonelier and somewhat more oppressive atmosphere than later 3D platformers in the series, much of it owing to <em>64</em>'s status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechDemoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechDemoGame">Tech Demo Game</a> released early in the N64's life. Friendly NPCs are few and far between, and many stages have none at all&mdash;most other characters you'll run into are enemies, of which only a handful have any dialogue. Luigi also has absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">no appearance whatsoever</a>, where in later 3D games (and RPGs) he would at least have a token appearance as an NPC if he wasn't playable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3w756');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3w756" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3w756');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Sunshine</a></em> is an exception to this, with the implication that Luigi is taking a break after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em></span>.

Hence, a deactivated pebble won't hit the ground and unload, but instead just remain invisible and unmoving in midair. So by having Monty Moles continually throw pebbles off the edge, the pebbles will keep loading into object slots but never unload.

The closest thing is a sign in the large part of Tiny-Huge Island, but it's located on a very small island that isn't easy to reach, and the sign itself only gives an oblique hint; it feigns innocence in the event you get dizzy from running around the wooden pole just nearby.<div class="indent"><strong>Signpost:</strong> I take no responsibility whatsoever for those who get dizzy and pass out from running around this post.</div></li><li> Whomp's Fortress, an otherwise straightforward level, has a very well-hidden star that, unless you're aware of it ahead of time, can only be found by trial and error. It's hidden in a breakable piece at the tip of a thin brick wall that you have to launch Mario into via cannon &#151; and it looks no different than any other piece of scenery in the level. While the name of the star's goal is "Blast Away the Wall", finding out <em>which</em> wall to blast at, and which specific part, is completely left to the player to find out.

Curiously, Mario has a startling amount of control over his Long Jump, allowing him to keep going backwards without losing momentum if he uses it over and over (which in turn allows the famous "Backwards Long Jump" glitch to work).

Running out of lives will instead send you back to the intro Mario screen, where then starting your file back up just starts you outside the Castle as usual with no progress lost unless for some reason you haven't been saving the game when you get a new star, so overall running out of lives is just a slight inconvenience, as you can just get right back to the level you were at within a minute without anything being lost. The exception to this are the Bowser fights: Dying against Bowser sends you right outside the pipe to him instead of back into the Castle, allowing you to jump right back to fighting him without redoing the level, so getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> against Bowser is a real detriment, as you would have to do the whole Bowser level again.

However, this only happens if you do it in front of them. If you're behind them (the Penguin) or very far in front (Koopa the Quick), you can cheat. Strangely, Koopa the Quick will only call you a cheater if you use cannons or the Wing Cap during the race. As far as he's concerned, using warp zones is considered fair (presumably, he believes the warping you do involves speeds considered faster than humanly possible, which would give his "human blur" bit when you beat him a deeper meaning).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a>: It certainly seems like it what with all of the references to the game itself and the bosses telling you how to kill them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom">No Sidepaths, No Exploration, No Freedom</a>: The three Bowser levels have very linear pathways compared to the rest of the open-world game, with only small side areas occasionally popping up in them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLethalBottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLethalBottomlessPits">Non-Lethal Bottomless Pits</a>:<ul><li> The pits in Tower of the Wing Cap, Vanish Cap Under the Moat, and Wing Mario Over the Rainbow simply send you to another area: the first floor lobby, the pool next to the castle waterfall, and the pond by the castle cannon, respectively.</li><li> In the DS version, the pits in Big Boo Battle don't hurt you and only warp you back to the start of the level.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">Not the Fall That Kills You</a>: This was the first Mario game outside the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> games in which falling from too great a height could cause damage even if you landed on solid ground.

Thus, discovering and then exploiting this technique allowed speedrunners to break the game wide open as it allows for a variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> tricks, right down to being able to complete the game without so much as collecting a single star.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a>: The endless staircase prior to the final level; the darkness of the staircase beyond combined with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wp3rzAdwT8">the music<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> gives an unsettling feeling.

When you start the game, you can only enter Bob-Omb Battlefield, but getting 1 star lets you enter Whomps Fortress and the Secret Slide. Two more stars lets you play in two more courses. Getting 8 stars and beating Bowser gives you the key to the basement, and this is where the game really starts opening up, since you get four new courses to explore (with four more stars unlocking another course, <em>Big Boos Haunt</em>) and can begin searching for the three cap switches. Getting 30 stars and beating Bowser again lets you go upstairs and play four more courses, and getting 50 grants you access to the last two stages before the Endless Stairs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryDrowningSkills">Ordinary Drowning Skills</a>: The first game in the Mario franchise where water isn't breathable or instantly fatal.

Future 3D Mario games would handle this in a similar fashion, though they have a separate air meter &#151; there are no separate air and health meters in this game, with air and health using the same meter. Thus, you can heal yourself by diving into water and surfacing. Don't try this in Snowman's Land, though; the water you can swim in by the ice jet will in fact hurt you even if your head is above the water (and will sap your health twice as fast at that), and the water below the bully's platform is in fact so cold falling into it is the same as falling into lava.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PachelbelsCanonProgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PachelbelsCanonProgression">"Pachelbel's Canon" Progression</a>: The third section of the credits song is built on this progression.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainPoweredLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainPoweredLeap">Pain-Powered Leap</a>: Falling into lava will launch Mario into the air; this does damage, and can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">Cycle of Hurting</a> in the worst case scenario, but the leap <em>can</em> be controlled and used as a means to reach platforms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">Painting the Medium</a>: The Mad Piano's room in Big Boo's Haunt is shaped like a piano lid, made much clearer by the map in <em>DS</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThroughTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThroughTheRings">Pass Through the Rings</a>: Required for a handful of Stars.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>: Bowser's Sub permanently vanishes once you obtain the key from <em>Bowser In The Fire Sea</em> for the first time, and you need to use the floating poles from then on if you want to get its star again.

If that isn't enough, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis">specifically calls attention</a> where you can find at least two of them; the opening specifically highlights the inexplicable door in the Castle's moat and the pit that leads to the Vanishing Cap course, and after collecting 12 stars, a mysterious light will appear from the ceiling in the castle lobby, prompting a curious player to look up into it and instantly get transported to the Wing Cap course.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a>: The are two Stars that have you race against Koopa the Quick: one in Bob-omb Battlefield, the other in Tiny-Huge Island. The game expects you to do the Bob-omb Battlefield race first, but you can bypass it entirely. The game does not take this possibility into consideration, so not only is the name of the star mission in Tiny-Huge Island (Rematch with Koopa the Quick) a bit misleading, but when you meet up with Koopa the Quick in that level, he'll still talk about how he lost the previous race against you and wants a rematch, despite the fact that said race never took place. This is likely just a lack of foresight on the developers' part, if anything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalPicture">Portal Picture</a>: Most worlds' entrances.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">Power Up Letdown</a>:<ul><li> Whereas the Wing Cap is very handy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">if tricky to use</a>), and the Metal Cap is quite practical in several circumstances, the Vanish Cap is really only useful in very specialized circumstances, namely to get through the occasional thin wall. It does leave you briefly invincible, but that's about the extent of its usefulness, and even then it usually appears in worlds with few enemies around, so even that use of it is moot.</li><li> The Koopa shells you can ride on land are fun and even useful to use, but the underwater Koopa shells you can occasionally find in the water levels (i.e. Jolly Roger Bay, Dire Dire Docks) not so much. It's hard to grab due to some buggy collision detection, and all it does is let you move a little faster underwater for a few seconds before it vanishes.</li><li> At the end of the game, when you get all 120 stars <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and launch yourself up to the castle, you'll find Yoshi, who congratulates you, give you 100 free lives, and then adds a slight bounce and twinkle to the triple jump. The extra lives are superflous since you've already beaten the entire game, but the upgraded triple jump <em>does</em> protect you from high falls.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePlate">Pressure Plate</a>: There are switches Mario can step or slam on that will open doors or activate something nearby.

The bombs serve no purpose other than to hurt him, since he can't (or won't) throw you into the bombs himself, and you frankly have to be suicidal to run into them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandSucks">Quicksand Sucks</a>: It does so at different rates in Shifting Sand Land, ranging from very slowly to instant death. Which one you get depends on where it is (the swirling sand pits pull you down at a medium speed unless you venture into the center, which kills you immediately; there's also some different colored sand in certain parts of the level and the sand in the pyramid is slow; the quicksand around the border of the course, surrounding the pyramid, and under the metal block maze is instantly fatal and has to be treated as a bottomless pit).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacingMiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacingMiniGame">Racing Minigame</a>: Koopa the Quick wants to race you!

You need 12 stars to open all the courses on the first floor and get the caps &#151; but after you beat <em>Bowser in the Dark World</em>, the game pretty much gives you free reign on where to go. The only other obstacles are the key to the second floor and the Star Doors. But you don't even have to complete every level to get to Bowser &#151; it's possible to even skip a lot of the stars from both the castle basement and top floors if you're just settling for a 70 star run. Heck, you can reach <em>Bowser in the Fire Sea</em> while hardly setting foot downstairs if you're persistent enough with the early levels, with one star in <em>Dire, Dire Docks</em> blocking your path to it. You can complete the game without ever going to the second and third floor levels by getting every star in the foyer and basement (there are 74 in total there).</li><li> Some of the levels have mild railroading in them. For example, in Bob-omb Battlefield, you absolutely have to get the first star in order to race Koopa the Quick and unlock the cannons, which you need to get the star on the Island in the Sky (though in practice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">it's possible to reach it with a very skilled long jump</a>), plus the red coin on it and the rings of floating coins nearby that are needed for the 100 coin star (the highest amount of coins you can get without reaching the island is 94 to 99, depending on whether a regular Koopa shows up or if you long jump to the island). You technically need to backtrack there again once you have the Wing Cap to beat Mario Wings To The Sky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">but that can be bypassed by using the cannon.</a> It is possible to get the Chain Chomp star first, though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>: Bowser uses the stolen Stars "to create his own world in the paintings and walls" (according to Toad), each Star Door room to him contains a different physic-bending defense, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he can <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleport">Teleport</a> in his second fight</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong">Rearrange the Song</a>:<ul><li> All of the classic <em>Mario</em> themes are given an update, and were pretty damn good.</li><li> The new stage music for Bob-omb Battlefield, Cool, Cool Mountain, and the Secret Slide areas (among others) are all rearrangements of the same tune.

The game doesn't even <em>try</em> to be realistic in either design, tone, or physics, although the game does have a few internal rules in order to be playable. Friend and foe alike are bizarre and abstract in design. The entire castle has entire worlds resting inside of magic paintings or in hidden passages, and they too have odd, impossible elements of fantasy, such as floating islands or pipes that can make a world grow or shrink in a second. Killing an enemy just leaves behind a coin in their place. Mario can survive insanely high falls, and the most it does is take away half his health, and he can find hats that briefly make him fly, turn to metal or invisible (and in one part of the game, you can combine the latter two to do <em>both</em>). A Thwomp or other giant block will just squash Mario like a pancake and take away a snip of his health. Surfacing in water refills your health. Lava just burns Mario's butt and launches him high into the air. Mario losing all of his health just sends him flying out of a painting and instantly heals him upon throwing him out (at the cost of a 1-up).

However, the developers realized that clever players could reach the fight as Yoshi and added a fire to the arena for him to eat so he can damage Eyerok.</li><li> If you defeat Bowser without unlocking Luigi or Wario, they will be completely absent from the ending.

Or just smash the post in one hit as an invincible Mega Mario/whoever equivalent. For every other mission in the game, the 'easy trick' was simply to use Luigi and backflip, since it basically let you glide gently down to just about anywhere from a high enough pointer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>: Mario and Wario were usually rivals and/or enemies.

Trying to access the final stage with any of the other characters will cause them to get stuck on the Endless Stairs, irrespective of how many stars you have (the jumping glitch to bypass the stairs has also been fixed to prevent the other characters from reaching the top; however, there is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2scQtHs3Y0">a different glitch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that you can do).</li><li> Koopa the Quick will only race Mario.

A 0 Star Run is also explicitly impossible in it, even with tool-assisting and glitches, since you absolutely need to unlock Mario in order to complete the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>: Occasionally, any rabbit you've already caught will be replaced by a glowing rabbit.

With this strength, he can pull signposts out of the ground and throw them at enemies or pound the signs into the ground, he has a much stronger punch (useful for Bullies and Eyerok, the latter requiring fewer hits with Wario), and he can <em>destroy the giant cannonball obstacles and punch Tox Boxes off their maze</em> (when they roll safely over him). He also isn't slowed down by carrying boxes, Chuckyas, or Big Bob-omb.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTitle64Advance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTitle64Advance">Super Title 64 Advance</a>: This trope happened again, as this version adds "DS" to the name, while still keeping "64" in its title. So the former part tells us the system, while the latter part tells us which game it is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a>: The game keeps the same sound design as the original, and as such, the new voice clips for Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario are made to sound in line with their lower quality, and Peach's old voice actress came back to record extra lines rather than the game using the vocal direction they established in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a>: Since Yoshi can't pick up enemies, going into a Bowser battle with Yoshi makes Bowser's fire breath spawn hats which allow Yoshi to become someone who can actually fight back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight">Things That Go "Bump" in the Night</a>: Referenced by Tuxie in a dummied-out line that was apparently supposed to be an alternate version of her line when you have Yoshi eat her.<div class="indent"><strong>Tuxie:</strong> So it IS true that there's a monster that eats naughty kids...</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman</a>:<ul><li> Wario is pretty much useless except for the levels which are specifically designed to make use of his abilities. Even then, it's usually a job for Wario's <em>hat</em>, since it's much quicker and easier to just have the character you're playing as put that on than switch to him. The only reason to actually use Wario after getting him is the levels that can only be accessed by him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> with Yoshi; although he isn't particularly useful on his own (though he excels in getting 100-coin stars), his flutter-jump ability makes him the best jumper, possibly better than Luigi, and his ability to enter a stage with any character's cap makes him convenient to have around.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheMookAtThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheMookAtThem">Throw the Mook at Them</a>: The game has only Yoshi as a playable character at the start. As such, he cannot punch enemies, but he can swallow them to stock up on eggs to throw. Both King Bob-omb and Goomboss could not be beaten if they did not have their respective mooks to fuel Yoshi for eggs. If anyone other than Yoshi fights Goomboss, the fight will be slightly different in that you have to punch Goombas into Goomboss in order to hurt him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a>: Wario is supposedly this. Granted, unless he <em>really</em> likes cake or wants revenge on Bowser for capturing him, he has no informed ulterior reason to rescue Peach, making his actions for once seem unambiguously heroic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropicalIslandAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropicalIslandAdventure">Tropical Island Adventure</a>: One of the new courses added to this version is Sunshine Isles, a set of small tropical islands that you need to find five Silver Stars on to get a Power Star.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>: Now with more characters, Stars, levels, and minigames.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Video Game Remake</a>: Instead of being a mere port, the DS version has actually been rebuilt from the ground up, as evidenced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">crisper textures and more detailed character models</a>, as well as some stages being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHisSled">slightly altered</a>.
