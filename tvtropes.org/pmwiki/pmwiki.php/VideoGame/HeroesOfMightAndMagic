Famous both for its extremely high quality and its sheer number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Packs</a> for the later games.</p><p>According to both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThatOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThatOtherWiki">That Other Wiki</a> and the fansite <a class="urllink" href="http://www.heroesofmightandmagic.com/">Age of Heroes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the series was inspired when someone had the idea of combining the walk-around-the-map-trying-to-save-the-world strategy of the earlier NWC game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsBounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsBounty">King's Bounty</a></em> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleplayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleplayingGame">Roleplaying Game</a> aspects of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em>. There are occasional crossovers between the series: <em>Might and Magic 6</em> shares a setting (Enroth) with <em>Heroes of Might and Magic 1</em> and <em>2</em>, and runs almost concurrently with <em>Heroes 3</em>. <em>Might and Magic 7</em> shares setting (Antagarich) with <em>Heroes 3</em>, and runs between <em>3</em> and its expansion pack <em>Armageddon's Blade</em>. Enroth and Antagarich are continents of the same planet, as is <em>Might and Magic 8</em>'s setting, Jadame.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Lord Morglin Ironfist is ousted from his homeland of Varn by his cousin, Ragnar. Fleeing with his few loyal followers through a portal, he finds himself on another planet, in the land of Enroth. Enroth is a contested land: Lord Slayer, Queen Lamanda, and Lord Alamar are locked in a civil war for control of the continent. Ironfist himself quickly establishes himself as a fourth player in this power struggle.</p><p>The player gets to chose which of the four warlords they control during the single-player campaign - however the canonical ending is a victory for Morglin Ironfist and the foundation of the Ironfist Dynasty.</p><p>The second game's campaign centers around a civil war between Morglin's sons - Roland Ironfist, a good knight/wizard, and Archibald Ironfist, a not-so-good warlock. After their father's death, the line of succession is questioned, leading to disagreements between the two. The Royal Seer who was supposed to make the decision <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">unfortunately died in a boating accident</a>. His next three successors died similar deaths before Roland is accused of murdering them and goes into hiding, leaving the fifth Royal Seer to declare Archibald the king, while Roland initiates an insurgency to oust his evil brother.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The expansion pack, Price of Loyalty, included four new campaigns and some improvements to game balance. What it did not include was a continuation of the main storyline - this would continue in the third installment (and installment 6 of the related <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> series).</p><p>Backstory for the games <em>Heroes 3</em> and <em>M&amp;M 6</em> states the canonical victor of the second to be Roland: by the time of those two games, he is King of Enroth, married to Catherine Gryphonheart, heir to the throne of Enroth's ally, Erathia. The two have a son together (Nicolai, an NPC in Might and Magic VI).</p><p>It is around this point that the Kreegans (a race of aliens that look like demons) invade the North-West of Enroth and the North-East of Antagarich (the continent Erathia is located on).</p><p>The third game is the first in the series to move the action away from the continent of Enroth. Instead it occurs on the southern continent of Antagarich. King Gryphonheart of Erathia has died and the enemies of Erathia (the Antagarich branch of the Kreegan Invasion, the Dungeon Overlords of Nighon, and the Necromancers of Deyja) take the opportunity of its weakened state to launch attacks against it. Queen Catherine leads a force of the Enrothian army to reclaim control of her homeland with the aid of Erathia's local allies AvLee (elves, dwarves, and centaurs) and Bracada (human and genie wizards). The other nations on Antagarich&mdash;-the nation of Krewlod, a wasteland ruled by barbarous humans, orcs, goblins, and ogres; and the lizardfolk and gnolls of the Tatalian swamps&mdash;take this as an opportunity to bite off a little of their neighbors' territory while they are all distracted with each other, thus beginning the eight-way "Restoration War".</p><p>The third game's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> <em>Armageddon's Blade</em> occurs after the eventual victory of Erathia and its allies in the third game. It features a young ranger, Gelu, and his quest to stop a devil from creating the titular artifact and using it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> (or destroy the world, either one seems likely). In addition, there are some other campaigns. In the chaos following the Restoration War, a Nighon overlord seeks to transform herself into a dragon; on the flip side, a wizard's apprentice attempts to become a dragonslayer and prove himself; a young barbarian, Kilgor, seeks to become the new ruler of Krewlod during its Festival of Life; and a Tatalian witch, outcast for her use of fire magic, tries to save her homeland from an undead invasion, led by a figure from the Restoration War. Before all of this, in a comedic prequel campaign, Sir Christian, the first hero you get in the first Restoration War campaign, has a devil of a time getting home to Erathia.</p><p>The third game's other Expansion Pack <em>The Shadow Of Death</em> acts as a prequel to the actual third game, exploring the backstory of several important character and how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> of the lich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Sandro</a> resulted in him igniting the Restoration War almost singlehandedly.</p><p>Using the <em>Heroes III</em> engine, eight standalone episodes were released called Heroes Chronicles. The series starred Tarnum, who in the first episode, rose from being a shepherd to becoming the king of the barbarians; but in his quest to free his people from the Empire of Bracaduun (the evil predecessors to Bracada), a series of painful setbacks lead him to become increasingly brutal, tyrannical, and paranoid; history would remember him as the Barbarian Tyrant. His reign ends abruptly when Rion Gryphonheart, Queen Catherine's ancestor and founder of the nation of Erathia, challenged him to single combat and slew him. Judged by the barbarian gods know as the Ancestors, he is found wanting, and is resurrected as an immortal hero to seek redemption through a thousand-year series of quests fighting the forces of evil. Several of these quests also serve as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a>, as he must help those he once warred against, but in the final episode, he fails to recover the Sword of Frost before someone else did.</p><p>After these events, Gelu, who now wields the Armageddon's Blade and has been driven insane by it, embarks on a quest to destroy the Sword of Frost, which has been recovered by the Barbarian King, Kilgor. When the two weapons clash, it releases Armageddon upon the world that <em>Heroes</em> 1-3 were set on. Those that survived used a series of portals to evacuate to another world, Axeoth, which leads into the events of <em>Heroes of Might and Magic IV</em>. The RPG <em>Might and Magic IX</em> is also set on Axeoth, but a different continent.</p><p><em>IV</em>, much like <em>Armageddon's Blade</em>, features standalone campaigns, one for each town. The Life campaign follows the efforts of the knight Lysander to preserve the nation he founded and rules when a usurper king emerges, claiming to be the last survivor of the Gryphonheart bloodline and igniting a civil war. The Might campaign centers around Warjak, a young barbarian and the son of Tarnum, as he tries to rally the barbarians and save them from extinction warring against one another (as well as concluding the story of Tarnum, the protagonist from Heroes Chronicles). The Order campaign chronicles the journey of Emilia Nighthaven as she rises from being a peasant to becoming a sorceress-queen, and eventually fights a war to stop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">controlling the wills of every creature in the world</a>. The Preserve campaign tells the tale of Elwin and Shaera, a love story with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Elvish</a> civil war when the druid protagonist, Elwin, rebels against the elven lord who has mind-controlled his lover Shaera into marrying him. The Chaos campaign explores the adventures of Tawni Balfour, a pirate who rises from inheriting her father's ship to becoming a Pirate Queen of an entire ocean. And finally, the Death campaign tells the tale of Gauldoth Half-Dead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">a half-dead man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">forced to play savior of the world</a> after he becomes the lord of an undead kingdom, only to find that the God of Death that manipulated the Armageddon that struck his previous world has similar plans for his new world. There are two expansion packs, which features even more heroes' tales, and these expansion packs have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> scenarios for each pack, uniting the heroes of each scenarios for one last bang. The original 6 heroes didn't get such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, but a custom map made for the fifth game below features the closest thing you can get for it, although only Lysander, Emilia Nighthaven and Gauldoth Half-Dead (and characters from those scenarios) are present.</p><p>After <em>IV</em>, 3DO went into hard times and NWC eventually ceased to exist. The rights for the series eventually went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagicAshan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagicAshan">a new entry in the series was hatched, along with a spin-off</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>The series makes use of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACommanderIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACommanderIsYou">A Commander Is You</a><ul><li> <em>Spammer Faction</em>: The Necropolis. Its individual units are quite weak compared to others, but it tends to have high weekly growth, and necromancers can raise overwhelming amounts of creatures with their necromancy skill.<ul><li> The Conflux in III as well. The sprites and phoenixes (though the latter does have the highest speed in the game) are both weak for their tier, but produce faster than any creature of the same tiers in other towns.</li><li> Necropolis' role as spammer faction in III is further exaggerated by the relatively easy-to-get combination artifact Cloak of the Undead King, that only works for full effect for Necropolis heroes. It is quite a superweapon that causes enemy dead to be resurrected as fairly powerful liches (shooters whose attacks can damage non-undead units adjacent to the target)) instead of measly skeletons. It is not uncommon to raise armies of thousands of liches with the Cloak, while normally their amount tends to stay under 500.</li><li> Thanks to their Gating-skill, the Inferno of V and VI does this another way. As a matter of fact, their own creatures are still comparatively weak, especially at the lower tiers.</li><li> In a quite an interesting twist, Necropolis in VI became a mixup of <em>Technical Faction</em> and <em>Elitist Faction</em> due to the rework of Necromancy(which now allows to raise your fallen troops in the heat of a battle rather than just getting tons of skeletons).</li><li> And In VII, one ability allows you to raise ghosts from necromancy, giving you all that much more power.</li><li> The original game's Knight town was this. All the units were significantly weaker than their equivalents, but are cheaper and have higher growth rates. For example, the paladins are weaker than cyclopes, phoenixes or dragons, but they're the only ultimate unit with a base growth of more than one per week.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Elitist Faction</em>: The Dungeon. Low weekly growths and high unit/building costs, but its units are very powerful, especially its dragons which are typically the strongest creatures in the game.<ul><li> Castle in Heroes III as well. While their ranged units are relatively fragile and don't do much later on, out of seven units in town, <em>four of them</em> can be considered the best on their level or at least in top 3(Halberdiers who have the biggest health in this tier and hit like a truck because no one will bother to take them out first; Royal Griffins who have a great weekly growth, are fast and have unlimited retaliations (in the game where every other unit has only one unless enhanced with magic); Crusaders who are tough, hard-hitting and generally steamroll over everything even in low numbers and Archangels who are insanely fast, deal fixed amount of damage (making them immune to Curse) and before the expansion was regarded as the strongest creature in the game, raise party's morale and are able to resurrect fallen troops respectively). Quite amusingly, in the first two games they were severely underpowered, to the point of being basically useless.</li><li> Haven in Heroes VII also qualifies, due to having strong creatures with great abilities.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Brute Force Faction</em>: The Stronghold. In <em>IV</em> they can't use magic at all, and in <em>V</em> they can only use a special set of spell-like abilities designed specifically for them. The units also tend to be disposed towards "attack before attacked" strategies due to the fact that most of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>. In V and VII They have the bloodrage ability, which boosts offensive capabilities but you lose some of it if you wait or defend.<ul><li> Ditto in previous installments, though they have some tankier units (some of them are <em>the</em> tanks of the installment. Case in point, Ogres in II and III). Also, in III, Stronghold can use magic but their Mage Guild only goes up to level 3 instead of 5 (though seizing a non-Stronghold town takes care of that problem).</li></ul></li><li> <em>Ranger Faction</em>: The Sylvan faction, natch. Interestingly, elves aren't predominant in it except in <em>V</em>.<ul><li> Interestingly, Life Faction (humans) in IV. They have an access to arguably the best ranged units (and Monks) in the game and outmatched only by the likes of Cyclops or Catapult (Crossbowmen who disregard the distance factor and Ballistae who do the same <em>and</em> disregard the obstacle penalty respectively), while their counterparts (Squires, Pikemen and Crusaders in that order) are fairly average in their own rights.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Balanced Faction</em>: Sylvan in VII. The Racial skill isn't really heavily specialized, and most of the units are average.</li><li> <em>Technical Faction</em>: The Academy.

Even the ones that can be assembled often takes up a lot of equipment slots, rendering that hero basically only good for one thing (a hero with the Cornicopia will basically never want to see combat ever again).

Several of the campaign levels featured one-way teleporters right into your territory. Coupled with the AI being unaffected by fog of war (and perhaps even shroud), you're going to get a lot of invasions as soon as you leave your towns at the least bit disadvantaged.</li><li> At least in II, heroes resting up in castles get their spell points back at the beginning of their turn, for players anyway; for the computer? Well, the computer gets spell points back at the <em>end</em> of its turn. They attack you in a castle, no spell points back. You attack them in a castle, they've got them all back.</li><li> Apparently, the development team for <em>VI</em> is working to make this as minimal as possible.

It also lacked pretty much any story in the game itself &mdash; the four campaigns were the <em>same</em> except for different starting towns and each lacking the map about attacking the lord you picked, the map descriptions were bare bones and there was no new story in the maps, far from the voiced briefings and in-map events of <em>II</em> onward.<ul><li> One result is that since there is no "Wisdom" skill that caps the level of magic a hero can learn, any hero with a spellbook can learn any spell, including the incredibly broken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Dimension Door</a>.</li></ul></li><li> The battlefield in the first game is much smaller than in other games.

The second game, which introduced the feature, only allowed some units to be upgraded. In a rare exception, the Dragons, the ultimate unit of the Warlock town, could be upgraded <em>twice.</em></li><li> The first and second games had each town offer six different types of units, but heroes only had five slots in their army, meaning that they'd have to forgo at least one type of their town's units. Starting in <em>III</em>, it was possible to include one of each type of a town's units into a hero's army.</li><li> In the first game, scenarios randomly selected your town type and in some cases, your starting location.

However, she has low health and defense and is the favorite target of PC-controlled creatures, which makes her lifespan quite short.</li><li> In the late game, large creature stacks turn into this, regardless of the individual statistics of the creature itself. This is because when you've reached the hundreds, so has your opponent. From here on each hit will no longer be taking out a percentage of your health, but rather how many troops there are in the stack. This means that unlike early game, where you can avoid significant casualties due to damage not being anywhere near high enough to actually kill people, now you're afraid of the stiffest breeze. Most battles at this level generally lead to Pyrrhic Victories or complete curbstomps, because unless it's the final battle for the map you WILL need to have the majority of your troops survive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>: Roland in Heroes II may be "good, kindly, and honorable," but he isn't above using force of arms to subjugate the nobility near his castle (albeit reluctantly) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turn Archibald to stone</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Gratuitous German</a>:<ul><li> In II, the town themes' lyrics are all random quotes from the German translation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, or of <em>Also sprach Zarathustra</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>.</li><li> Before <em>The Price of Loyalty</em> (which changed the town themes around), it was alignment-coded: the good towns had random quotes from a German translation of the Bible, while the evil towns had random quotes from <em>Also sprach Zarathustra</em> in the original German.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>:<ul><li> Obtaining the ultimate skills for each of the heroes in the fifth game.

Yeah, the last mission of one of these campaigns gives your hero a six month time limit to get past a gauntlet of incredibly powerful creature stacks to fight <em>one hundred azure dragons</em>. Said campaign also heavily relies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">luck</a> and other forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a>. <em>And it isn't even the hardest campaign</em>.</li><li> The very first quest in the Chaos Campaign in <em>IV</em>. It starts with a mad dash to capture a castle within 7 days. And that's the only Chaos Town you get. You're immediately in a war with a Might player that can control up to 5 towns - you <em>need</em> to take a couple of them before the computer player has time to build up its army. The computer player also has a gate right next to your town, meaning you can't leave it undefended. Hopefully for your sake the computer player chooses to attack you with mid strength armies instead of combining into one super strong one. If you beat the Might player, you then have to defeat a Nature player who's been locked out of the battle behind a colored gate - and doing nothing but hording resources and armies while you battled with Might. At least here you can rely on Might's superior creature generation to give you an edge, but it's a brutal slog no matter what. The Chaos Campaign itself is by far the toughest in the game, but the other quests in it are a step down from the first one.</li><li> <em>V</em> isn't shy of some brutal scenarios either. For example, <em>The Cultists</em>, where your two main heroes fight against a bunch of powerful heroes with no less than seven towns. You start with none, though you can capture the first two towns fairly quickly. For extra fun, there are also demon heroes that spawn on a regular basis to harass you. Or <em>The Emerald Ones</em>, where you are at a 3:1 disadvantage for quite some time and also have no access to your tier 7 unit.
