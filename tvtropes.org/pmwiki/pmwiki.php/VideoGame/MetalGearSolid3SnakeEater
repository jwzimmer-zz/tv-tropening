The United States of America have formulated a plan to covertly extract a Soviet defector, scientist Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, before he is forced to complete a nuclear superweapon for the USSR. To this end, a lone FOX operative codenamed "Naked Snake" is sent deep into enemy territory by the CIA to secure Sokolov and escort him across the Iron Curtain without leaving a trace.</p><p>The mission goes horribly wrong when Snake's lifelong mentor and maternal figure, the legendary soldier known as "The Boss", suddenly intervenes to abduct Sokolov and announce her defection to the Soviet Union. She escapes with the help of her personal "Cobra Unit" and their new commander, Colonel Yevgeny Borisovitch Volgin, who detonates an American nuclear warhead to cover their tracks and frame the USA for his own treasonous activities.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A tense backroom deal is struck between the USA and the Soviet Union in order to prove the former's innocence and stop the warmongering Volgin from staging a coup against the latter. Codenamed "Operation Snake Eater", Snake must infiltrate the Soviet jungle of Tselinoyarsk, eliminate Volgin and his rogue faction, destroy Sokolov's superweapon, and assassinate The Boss. But as the mission goes on, Snake learns there may be more to this operation - and The Boss's defection - than meets the eye...</p><p>In terms of gameplay and its mechanics, <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> puts more emphasis on survival than previous games, as it requires the player to hunt, eat, and heal their wounds manually to survive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KojimaProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KojimaProductions">Kojima Productions</a> swapped out the static indoor maps of the previous games with sprawling outdoor environments that require the player to make use of camouflage to stay hidden from enemy sentries.

It featured another main character switcheroo, but this time, Kojima Productions eased the pain by replacing Solid Snake with the man he was cloned from, Naked Snake.

The events of Operation Snake Eater are just the start of his breaking into the bitter, angry shell of a man <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who would eventually become Big Boss</span>. First, the amount of physical trauma the man is put through is absurd: During the ill-fated Virtuous Mission, he has his arm broken, a shattered rib and multiple lacerations from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">losing his first fight with The Boss</a> and being thrown from a bridge into a river.

He is then shot through the thigh with a crossbow bolt, poisoned with the venom of one of the deadliest spiders on earth, beaten to within an inch of his life, subjected to 10 million volts of electroshock torture which is so painful that he <em>pisses himself</em> from the agony, and <em>then</em> he has his right eye shot out. This is just counting <em>canon</em> injuries, and any lesser man would be a physical and psychological wreck by the end of it, but what really breaks him is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having to murder his mentor and mother figure, who in actuality never betrayed her country to begin with, just so the government could save face.

This was fixed in <em>Subsistence</em>, which altered the system to use a mobile, player-controlled third person camera.

While it can be used when on a high-up mountain with some minimal amounts of snow, there are other camos that blend in with the environment better.

For instance, if Snake finds some Russian glowcap mushrooms, he can call Para-Medic to discuss its nutritional properties. When he starts to wonder if eating the mushrooms will replenish the batteries in his equipment, she tells him to believe whatever the hell he wants. As luck would have it, eating the Russian glowcap <em>does</em> replenish the batteries.

He seems rather proud of his skill, though in actuality, he's very, very bad at it; nobody he tortures <em>ever</em> talks, and he actually manages to interrogate <em>himself</em> while torturing Snake. Not that this matters to him. It's outright stated by EVA that he literally gets off on the pain of others, and doesn't really care if his victims talk as long as he gets his kicks. After witnessing it firsthand, Ocelot decides that torture isn't as bad as he previously thought; anyone who's played <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> will know his ratio of people tortured versus information extracted is similar to Volgin's.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a>: While disguised as Major Raikov, Snake can get away with pretty much anything, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">punching his subordinates in the balls</a> without anyone even batting an eyelid.

The former has slightly better stopping power and a larger magazine at the cost of higher recoil and more difficult to use sights. The latter has lower recoil, more user friendly sights, select fire options, and the ability to take a suppressor, all of which make it viable as both an assault rifle and as an alternative to the 1911 for stealth kills at the cost of a smaller magazine than the AK and less available ammo</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>:<ul><li> Sergei Gurlukovich had a throwaway line in <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> claiming that "even the technology that gave birth to these weapons is Russian!"

This prompted its revision in <em>Subsistence</em> to an over-the-shoulder camera more typical for the third person genre. By default, this is only camera option available in the 3DS remake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>: Snake is told at the beginning of Operation Snake Eater that his goal is to kill The Boss. You know what's coming, especially since this Snake goes on to become Big Boss. It's also no surprise that Big Boss loses an eye during his mission.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">EVA's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>, style of using it, and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBike">Cool Bike</a> are all Chinese, as Sigint tells the player if they call him about her.

Guess who <em>Ocelot</em> really is? For bonus points, during your final encounter with him, he introduces himself as <em>Adamska</em>. And then there's his love of American revolvers, a shooting style right out of a western and taking the name of an American wildcat. Guess who has <em>his</em> real loyalties?</span></li><li> The Boss when Naked Snake asks her the reason why she defected to the Soviet Union: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">"I didn't."</a></em> The one time in the whole game where she is being completely honest and level with him.</span></li><li> The game hints at the characteristics of the Cobra Unit in the areas before their boss fights. Snake is attacked by bees before he fights The Pain, Snake moves through The Fear's trap filled arena before he actually needs to fight him, Snake encounters flamethrower mooks before he fights The Fury and so on. The exception is The End, who is introduced just a minute before The Fear but is fought afterwards.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>: Not a true bug <em>per se</em>, but once a sniper rifle of any kind is found, if the player zooms in, and while still holding the L1 button, presses the R2 button to activate the weapon selection menu, then releases the L1 button, and then selects either of the handguns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore">and while still holding the R2 button</a>, presses and holds the R1 button, then engages the fire button, <em>and then</em> releases both the fire button and the R2 button, it is possible to snipe people with a silenced handgun from across the entire map, with literally no margin of error. Granted, the maneuver is not exactly easy to pull off, but once it is mastered, it is literally impossible to miss. It's also possible to pull of this trick with the binoculars the player has from the beginning. In other words, there is no such thing as maximum effective range for any of the guns in this game. Or maybe Snake's just that good of a shot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>:<ul><li> Look carefully at the Ocelot soldiers' bodies right after their first run-in with Snake. Almost all the Ocelots have been knocked unconscious, but one soldier in particular has been tranquilized with a dart, just like in the preceding cutscene.</li><li> Ocelot's AI during his boss fight is tailored to his in-story personality. He reloads his gun <em>in the open</em> because he simply doesn't think he can be (seriously) harmed (and if you shoot him while he's reloading, he wises up and seeks cover to do so subsequent times), and most of the time he has a chance at hitting Snake with a straight shot, he'll disregard it in favor of a fancier ricochet shot instead.</li><li> The Sorrow's fight is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> against a ghost. The game demonstrates this by showing his life meter: <em>it's already empty</em>. You can't kill what's already dead.</li><li> After Snake has his eye shot out, if you go into first-person mode, the far-right of the screen is darkened and your depth perception is off, forcing you to relearn how to aim. This goes even further in the 3DS version, which forcibly disables the 3D option in first-person view, regardless of your settings.</li><li> When Snake is discovered by Volgin in Groznyj Grad, he's able to successfully perform a CQC counter on him. The Boss does the same seconds later, hinting at how it can be used against Volgin later on during his boss fight. This might surprise players given that for the most part, CQC hasn't been an ideal strategy to use against any of the previous bosses.</li><li> Beating Ocelot and Volgin (pre-Shagohod) lethally do not count as kills in the final results, as they survive those fights.</li><li> The Boss will admonish Snake if he dons any ill-fitting or otherwise goofy camouflage options during the Virtuous Mission after expressing her surprise. One such piece, the Monkey Mask from Snake vs. Monkey, will surprise her enough to the point where she will literally leave herself open during her boss fight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>:<ul><li> Snake is airdropped into the mission and told by Major Zero that the enemy may be listening to their communications first thing. Zero then gives a detailed briefing, including explicitly stating who Snake is working for, where he is, and what he's doing, over these same comms.</li><li> This same debriefing details the operating procedure that Snake must adhere to by the letter: He must not engage the enemy, and must leave no trace of his presence, not equipment, footprints or even bodily fluids. This has absolutely no bearing on the gameplay, as Snake is free to shoot his way through hordes of guards and allow himself to be seen by pretty much anyone. However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> when playing on the highest difficulty, in which the game ends if you're seen by an enemy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle">Gangsta Style</a>:<ul><li> EVA's preferred method of fire. Her weapon of choice is a Mauser C96 (a Chinese copy, anyway). She relies on an actual method of firing the weapon known as "Bandit Shooting," which involves using the muzzle jump of the gun to create a sweeping effect that is <em>very</em> useful for clearing rooms and helps prevent cases from jamming in the gun. It's only very useful at a maximum range of about five yards, though. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact her gun and her shooting style are of Chinese origin are your first major clue that she's not actually a Soviet agent, but a <em>Chinese</em> one.</span></li><li> Ocelot aims his semi-automatic pistol sideways and with arms slightly bent in the first part of the game, which Snake uses against him. On Snake's advice that this technique is more suited to a revolver, he switches to one (and later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">two</a>).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaussianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaussianGirl">Gaussian Girl</a>: Ocelot sees Snake this way after their initial encounter.

EVA, on the other hand, carries <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Chinese copy</span> of the Mauser C-96, a clue that most will miss until the game's ending.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">Gotta Catch Them All</a>: In order to obtain the EZ Gun on any difficulty above Very Easy, the player has to catch at least one of every 48 plants and animals in a single playthrough.

This refers to the real-life reason as to why the project ended up canceled: a launch went awry and crashed midair into the M-21, which killed the drone operator.</li><li> One of the radio conversations with EVA has her discussing the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre">Katyn Forest massacre<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with Snake; apparently, in the <em>Metal Gear</em> timeline, Volgin was personally responsible for starting it and most of the actual killings.</li><li> If one calls Major Zero shortly after meeting up with EVA before infiltrating Groznyj Grad via Tikhogornyj, Zero will be holding back tears in regards to the phrase "I'll be your eyes." This is because this phrase was also used by an American spy who worked within GRU, Oleg Penkovskiy, who was discovered and executed in 1963. Appropriately, his codename was "Hero."</li><li> At one point, Sigint will mention that the Russians trained dogs to plant bombs below enemy tanks during World War II, where while they were successful in training the dogs to do the process itself, they messed up in that they ended up having the dogs bomb their own tanks by mistake, due to their using their own tanks to train the dogs. This actually happened in real life, with the suspected cause being that the Russians and the Germans used different fuel sources for their tanks.</li><li> If Snake holds a Claymore mine and calls Sigint, he suspects that the ones the player finds were stolen from an American arsenal or from performance trials in Southeast Asia. He then suspects that it won't be long before the Russians make their own version. In real life, the Russians eventually did develop their own directed anti-personnel mine, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MON-50">MON-50<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which shares more than a few similarities to the Claymore.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>: In Krasnogorje, there are anti-aircraft guns on the mountainside.

Does it look cool and symbolic? Yep. Flashbacks in <em>Peace Walker</em> depict Snake wearing the sneaking suit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">Misplaced Wildlife</a>: Tons of it, although Para-Medic can give a detailed explanation of every animal in the game, and explain that most of the animals that aren't supposed to be there were brought in for testing.

The use of this is perfectly illustrated in a single scene in which Snake is disguised as Volgin's effeminate boyfriend Raikov, who looks exactly like Raiden from <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, and Volgin playfully grabs at his crotch in much the same way President Johnson does to Raiden in the second game. One might think that this is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>. However, once Volgin realizes the person in question is not actually Raikov, it leads to him pummeling Snake half to death in one of the series' most shocking scenes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a>:<ul><li> Snake.

Tranquilizer darts will be equally effective on any regular enemy regardless of size, provided they are not wearing full body armor. Bosses can also be defeated non-lethally, but rather than knocking them out with a single dart to the head, they instead have a "stamina" bar, much like their regular health meter, which depletes the more they get hit by tranquilizer darts.

However, Volgin's middle name, which in Russian doubles as a patronymic name, is "Borisovitch", implying that his name was Boris Volgin.</li><li> The Boss has a similar case to Volgin. While her real name isn't revealed, it's claimed at various points that she has two other nicknames - "The Joy" being her actual codename among the Cobras, and "Voyevoda" as a nickname the Russians gave to her - which are never mentioned again outside of the cutscenes/radio conversations they're mentioned in (and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioIuvbf8KJI">one<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Secret Theater video in the <em>Subsistence</em> re-release).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">The Only One Allowed to Defeat You</a>: Ocelot regards Snake this way, even saying at one point: "Don't you die on me yet." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Boss also keeps Snake alive long enough for him to fulfill his mission of killing her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious">Our Cryptids Are More Mysterious</a>: Unidentified Mysterious Animals (UMAs).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Our Dragons Are Different</a>: The Shagohod is a colossal screaming dragon made of steel, but a dragon nevertheless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic">Outside-the-Box Tactic</a>: There are a <em>lot</em> of creative ways to defeat some of the bosses in the game. Some methods are even necessary for players embarking on a pacifist run:<ul><li> There are lots of ways to deal with Ocelot during the duel with him. You can shoot beehives to force him to leave cover and get a shot at him. He will accuse you of playing dirty if you do this, for some reason. You can also shoot his hat off of his head, which stops him for a while until he can put it back on, giving you a free shot.</li><li> If The Fear's stamina is half-depleted, he will start hunting for food. The player can then throw poisoned or rotten food at him, further depleting his stamina, and leaving him vulnerable for a few more shots. Conveniently, the area is full of poisonous dart frogs and mushrooms, which you can collect during your first pass through the area before fighting him.</li><li> One of the things which make the boss fight with The End so entertaining for players is the immense variety of ways you can fight him. It's actually easier, in fact, not to try to beat him at his own game; except for his scope lens reflecting sunlight and a noisy parrot companion, it is <em>seriously</em> difficult to find him if you just keep looking through a scope, more so when doing so <em>while he's already shooting at you</em>. You can: track his footprints down with the thermal goggles and follow him around the battlefield; capture his parrot, which you can follow back to him; use the Directional Mic to listen for his heartbeat; among other strategies. Or if the whole thing is just too frustrating, you can actually use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">Konami Code</a> to show his location on the map. Or advance the internal clock of your console by seven or more days, resulting in him dying of old age.</li><li> For a non-boss variant (as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to <em>MGS1</em>), there are several ways to escape your prison cell after Volgin's torture. If you caught the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the torture scene and saw The Sorrow holding up a chalkboard with a radio frequency written on it</span>, you can use that to open the cell door. One very elaborate method of escape can be initiated by throwing the food you're given back at the guard. After doing this three times, a cutscene will ensue, which ends with the guard giving Snake back his cigarettes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which turn out to be the Cig-Spray tranquilizer gas weapon</span>. You can then use that to incapacitate the guard as he walks in front of the cell door, opening it for you. Another method weaponizes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>: going into view mode in the uniform menu and spinning around for long enough will cause Snake to vomit when the game is unpaused, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the guard will stupidly open the cell to investigate</span>.</li><li> As opposed to just mowing him down with your guns, there are lots of other tactics which can be used against Volgin in the first fight with him. CQC is surprisingly effective against him, although you have to time your approach or risk getting damaged. Wearing the Raikov mask will disorient him for a second, allowing you a free shot, although this only works once. Throwing a tree frog at him also has the same effect. A more bizarre yet viable tactic is throwing a Russian Glowcap mushroom near him, which results in the mushroom absorbing all of his electrical attacks. One mushroom can only absorb one attack, however.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Overly Long Gag</a>: The sequence where the player climbs a ladder. For a <em>very long time</em> (about two minutes, in fact). Admittedly, Snake <em>is</em> actually climbing up a mountain. At some point, a vocal variation of the theme song starts playing for no apparent reason. Said ladder serves as the game's intermission, splitting the game into two halves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a>:<ul><li> EVA's able to successfully fool the GRU members, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except for The Boss</span>, while acting as a former KGB officer by putting on glasses, slightly changing her hairstyle, and wearing a Soviet officer's outfit. The director's commentary even lampshades this fact.</li><li> When Snake puts on the scientist or technician disguises, he still wears his bandana. Soldiers are fooled, but run into another scientist/techie and they'll see right through it.</li><li> Snake manages to disguise himself exceptionally well as Raikov, to the extent that, in Zero's words, not even his own mother would tell them apart, but Volgin saw through the disguise after grabbing Snake's crotch. Later on, the player can gain a free hit on Volgin simply by putting on the Raikov mask in front of him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeacefulInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeacefulInDeath">Peaceful in Death</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Boss.

You remember, that thing you picked up at Graniny Gorki hours ago and never bothered using? It works with Snake's CQC combo, and The Boss can't disarm you. It can hit The Boss while she's on the ground, and can even hit her out of her shooting and walking animations. This can be used to exploit the game's programming, too. The Boss won't shoot when she's within CQC range. As long as you stay close and know how to consistently counter her grabs, she'll be finished in about two minutes. This turns one of the best and most dramatic fights in the entire series into little more than a high-stakes game of tag.</li><li> The Torch, of all things, works almost as well on The Boss as the Cig Spray. Apparently, she can't see a huge, fiery stick despite it being a dead giveaway to Snake's position. It has a longer reach than the Cig Spray and can hit her out of animations, but its combo does less damage and can't touch The Boss while she's grounded. She can also disarm you, which is the biggest problem. However, it's surprisingly easy to beat The Boss - non-lethally - with a stick.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a>: You see that stamina-killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">ladder</a>?

Snakes and Ladders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection">Voice with an Internet Connection</a>: The game makes it explicitly clear that, unlike previous <em>Metal Gear</em> games, Snake's contacts on the radio cannot actually see Snake, and the "faces" communicating with him are actually just photographs similar to a slide projector. However, in quite a few spots, they can tell what Snake's up to before he even says anything. EVA even freaks out if Snake calls her wearing the Raikov mask, somehow mistaking him for the real Raikov despite only being able to hear his unaltered voice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot">Vomit Indiscretion Shot</a>:<ul><li> Eating too much rotten or poisonous food will cause Snake's stomach to heave it all up, which is exactly what tends to happen in real life.</li><li> In the boss battle against Volgin, taking a solid uppercut from him will have Snake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom">sent skyward at least a story high</a>, and when he comes down, he'll vomit from the sheer pain.</li><li> Going into view mode when changing your outfits and spinning around for long enough causes a funny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> where Snake vomits out of dizziness once gameplay resumes. Doubles as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic">Outside-the-Box Tactic</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this technique can be used to trick a guard into opening your prison cell door</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkItOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkItOff">Walk It Off</a>: Snake recovers health automatically, depending on how much stamina he has, but first he has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">heal his wounds through impromptu surgery</a> to recover to full health. Although rations no longer heal Snake, he can take some Life Medicine to instantly heal himself (at the cost of a penalty to his final ranking). Conveniently, taking and healing wounds also increases Snake's maximum health in the long run.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>: EVA uses a Chinese copy of a Mauser C96 pistol. Ocelot starts out using a Makarov, but taking Snake's advice about using a revolver to better match his shooting style, switches to a Colt Single Action Army, one of the most distinctly American sidearms ever. The Boss uses a heavily modified M-16 with the barrel cut down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For all three characters, the weapon they use is a clue to their real allegiances. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Yes, even The Boss.</a></span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You are above even The Boss. I hereby award you the title of Big Boss."</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a>: In-universe example: if the player interrogates a certain guard at Graniny Gorki, the guard will state "The isolation cell guard... what an idiot!" which is obviously referring to the amount of easy escapes regarding scientists that end up in an isolation cell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>: An in-universe example: Rassvet was originally going to have a factory built in the area (explaining the half-completed structure's origins), but the Kremlin at some point decided to reorganize Tselinoyarsk into a secret military center and a research facility (Groznyj Grad and Graniny Gorki, respectively), thus cancelling the construction plans of the factory. A similar story exists for the Graniny Gorki lab: it was originally built as a prison, but at some point, it was converted into a research lab instead (which explains the presence of prison cells in the eastern portion of its basement).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidYouExpectWhenYouNamedIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidYouExpectWhenYouNamedIt">What Did You Expect When You Named It ____?</a>: Assigning three spies named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">ADAM, EVA and Snake</a> to a sensitive espionage mission? Yeah, that seems like a pretty big risk. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In a subversion, though, Snake is the only completely trustworthy agent of the three</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> An optional conversion with Para-Medic will have Snake explain why he recommended Ocelot use a revolver instead of a semi-auto. Snake doesn't really have an answer when Para-Medic responds by asking him why he was giving combat tips to his enemy.</li><li> Attacking EVA while escorting her will invoke this from the entirety of Mission Control.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">What the Hell, Player?</a>:<ul><li> If the player calls The Boss wearing the Ga-Ko camo, she berate them.</li><li> Bypassing The End via the internal clock trick will have Snake regretfully explain that fighting him was the old man's dying wish and that he feels like he disappointed him by not granting him that wish.</li><li> Try starting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, wearing the tuxedo and calling The Boss, and be prepared to be berated.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: Tselinoyarsk is explicitly stated to be within the Soviet Union, and it's implied to be bordering Pakistan in the beginning. Also, a map during the briefing at the beginning of the Virtuous Mission shows the Eastern Bloc and zooms in on the specific area where Tselinoyarsk is at. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also stated that the entry route for the Virtuous Mission was west of China and north of Southeast Asia. There is a fan theory that it is also the location of Zanzibar Land in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteShirtOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteShirtOfDeath">White Shirt of Death</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snake will fight The Boss who's wearing the white sneaking suit she dons since the main act started. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> even happens on a field of white flowers. After her death, said flowers become red.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeCostumeReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeCostumeReference">Whole Costume Reference</a>: The style of Snake's fatigues strongly resemble the ones worn by Olga Gurlukovich in the Plant Chapter of <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference">Whole Plot Reference</a>: The plot is lifted from <em>Crossfire</em> by J. C. Pollock, about a Soviet scientist who attempts to defect, but a special forces extraction mission fails and a week later a second mission is attempted (other elements were used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyAmITicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyAmITicking">Why Am I Ticking?</a>: TNT is normally used to destroy food storage and armory sheds, and even the Hind parked at the Bolshaya Past base. With the Infinity Face Paint, however, you can afford to experiment. TNT can be set almost anywhere to create distractions and chain reactions. This includes attaching TNT <em>on guards' backs.</em> You have to sneak up on them, but they'll never notice they've been rigged. Cue as many explosive shenanigans as you want.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>: Snake is terrified of the undead and ghosts. Just <em>mentioning</em> Dracula gives him nightmares. It can be inferred, then, that facing all those ghosts of the men he's killed really was the worst possible thing Snake could encounter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?</a>:<ul><li> Played straight in almost every other cutscene in the whole game. The pre-boss-fight cutscenes usually feature Snake creeping around, gun and knife at the ready, only for the boss to announce themselves and give Snake a monologue about his upcoming demise. Snake never takes the opportunity to just shoot them. Even if he's supposed to be "playing fair" and not firing first, The Fear opens their battle by shooting him in the leg with a poisoned crossbow bolt.</li><li> Volgin's first action upon realizing that Snake's most likely going to win is to order Ocelot to shoot Snake. Ocelot refuses, and he implies that the reason why he won't shoot him is because The Boss made him make the same promise that she made EVA promise later (that they neither kill nor aid in killing Snake).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a>: Being the first game chronologically in the series, <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> gives this one a proper explanation: Snake's presence in Russia is already a violation of international law, so he can't leave any evidence of his presence, which is why Snake begins the mission with minimal equipment, hence his codename, and has to procure his equipment on-site, a tradition which both the FOX and FOXHOUND units would later uphold for all their sneaking missions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly">Wizard Needs Food Badly</a>: Or your stamina will suffer for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">Worst Aid</a>:<ul><li> Burning leeches off with a cigar in real life makes them vomit into the wound, increasing the risk of infection.</li><li> The game doesn't care what order you perform medical tasks, or whether you attempt to perform a completely pointless bit of medication. This can lead to you disinfecting a wound <em>after</em> stitching and bandaging it up, stitching up a bullet hole <em>before</em> removing the bullet, or using your knife on a deep cut.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> The End consistently refuses to kill Snake for good, because he wants him to prove his worth by out-sniping him. Instead, The End uses harmless tranquilizer darts, and shows genuine disappointment in Snake should he ever pass out in the middle of the fight.</li><li> The Boss takes it even further than that, calling in an airstrike that will kill them both in ten minutes, thus giving Snake a time limit to complete his mission, which is to kill her. She seems eerily at peace with the prospect of her own death, even smiling as she tells him: "Let's make this the greatest ten minutes of our lives, Jack."</li><li> Ocelot does this, challenging Snake a number of times and coming away even more impressed every time. The final fight is a variation of Russian Roulette (one bullet, two guns, and they shoot at each other). No matter the outcome, Ocelot just laughs and jumps out of the plane, confident that he'll see Snake again. In fact, in most of the scene's variations, it is revealed that the bullet Ocelot has been carrying on a chain around his neck with the express purpose of defeating Big Boss is a blank.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRaySparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRaySparks">X-Ray Sparks</a>: In the torture sequence, Snake's skeleton is sometimes shown as he is repeatedly electrocuted by Volgin. Unlike most examples of this, this one is not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the least bit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>: Thought it was funny to shoot a man in the balls or slit a bunch of throats? Now face their specters in the river of the dead. There's also a few times in the game when a radio conversation mentions whether or not the player has gone on a killing spree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>:<ul><li> Surprisingly averted in regards to Ocelot and his unit at the end of the Virtuous Mission. Considering how they technically failed to capture Sokolov, since The Boss and her Cobra Unit is literally the only reason they even captured him in the first place, you'd think Volgin would have his unit executed. Instead, he is seen talking with Ocelot celebrating the overall success over their capture of the Shagohod and Sokolov without even a hint at wanting to punish Ocelot for the blunder.</li><li> It's heavily implied from a radio conversion with EVA that the reason why Johnny was unwilling to let Snake escape from the prison is because Volgin would have executed him if he either had Snake escape or if Snake died in the cell before Volgin could continue torturing him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">You Kill It, You Bought It</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snake gains the title of Big Boss after killing The Boss.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster">You Monster!</a>: EVA says this to Volgin during his torture of Sokolov.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Youngest Child Wins</a>: This is referenced in an optional radio conversation with Major Zero regarding Raikov.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero-Approval Gambit</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Boss and, to a lesser extent, Ocelot</span>.</li></ul></div><p></p><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"> <em>Son... you've got a way to fall...</em></div></dd></dl><hr>
