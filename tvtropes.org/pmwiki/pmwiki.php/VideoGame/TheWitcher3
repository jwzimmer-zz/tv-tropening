Unlike the previous two games, <em>Wild Hunt</em> is open-world with all areas accessible, rather than only one area per chapter.</p><p>In the wake of <em>Assassins of Kings</em>, Geralt continues his work as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">Witcher</a>, hunting monsters that would prey on the innocent in a world filled with chaos and war. After six months on the Witcher's Path, however, that all changes when an old friend of Geralt's, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard, summons the Witcher for a most poignant quest: Find Ciri, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">child of destiny</a> precious to them both; she is the one soul in the world whom Geralt considers kin.

A re-release on Nintendo Switch with all the DLC arrived on October 15, 2019.

The Free DLC Program consists of 16 pieces of content, ranging from new quests to alternate appearances. <em>Hearts of Stone</em>, the first expansion, was released on October 13, 2015. Geralt gets a contract from the mysterious Gaunter O'Dimm, the Man of Glass, which takes him on an adventure into the wilds of the Velen marshlands and the nooks and alleys of Oxenfurt. Caught in a thick tangle of deceit, Geralt will need all his cunning and strength to solve the mystery and emerge unscathed. <em>Blood and Wine</em>, the second expansion, was released on May 31, 2016. In contrast to the war-torn Northern Kingdoms, <em>Blood and Wine</em> takes Geralt back to the wine-making Nilfgaardian Duchy of Toussaint, untouched by the war and steeped in an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and knightly rituals. But underneath lies a dark, bloody secret that threatens both Geralt and the Duchy itself.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Preview: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ_G6XiHoUA">Debut Trailer,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0i88t0Kacs">Killing Monsters,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtVdAasjOgU">The Sword of Destiny,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoCRYX6Vq0">Go Your Way.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></p><p></p><hr><h2>This game contains examples of the following:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">Absolute Cleavage</a>: A number of female characters fall into this trope, such as Keira Metz and Corinne Tilly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap">Absurdly High Level Cap</a>: The base game's level cap was 70, though it was unlikely a player would get even halfway there through normal gameplay (though it was possible through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>). The cap was raised to 100 with the release of Blood &amp; Wine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbuseMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbuseMistake">Abuse Mistake</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> during a random encounter in Novigrad. Geralt comes across a man verbally berating a strumpet, who threatens to shank the man in turn if he doesn't step off. If Geralt intervenes trying to help the woman, the two of them reveal they were just engaging in a bit of... "intimate roleplaying" as foreplay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>:<ul><li> Played with. The Bloody Baron is a horrible human being but prides himself on never touching his daughter with an angry hand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His daughter, by contrast, points out that his years of black-out drunkenness and threats to her mother were a form of abuse by itself.</span></li><li> Lambert reveals that his father would beat both him and his mother.</li><li> Madman Lugos' son is called Blueboy is because as a child he's often seen covered in bruises, possibly "from his father's belt, rod and fists", as stated on his character entry.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentAdaptation">Accent Adaptation</a>: The game follows voice-acting conventions typical to most modern RPG series, and displays a variety of different real-world accents, which are used to denote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichLanguagePoorLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichLanguagePoorLanguage">the social status</a> or region of the characters. For example:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">British Accents</a> are frequently encountered; Refined RP is assigned to the higher status, sophisticated characters such as Yennefer and Emhyr var Emreis, SE London/Cockney accents for thuggish, disruptive characters, West Country and Welsh accents for rustic locals, an amusingly bluff Brummie accent for the crude, boorish Bloody Baron, and the now prerequisite Scottish accent for the dwarven characters, such as the blacksmith Willis.</li><li> The Crones of Crookback Bog (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and their "mother", the Lady of the Wood</span>), are voiced with (at times unintelligible) Welsh accents, and as Welsh is the oldest British tongue, this enhances their ancient venerability. Succubi and Sylvans have similar-sounding but slightly different accents, as they are members of the old races though they may not be so old themselves.</li><li> Ciri has an Estuary accent that veers towards RP at times, despite the fact she grew up amongst Witchers, Dryads, and a group of low-class thieves. However, she also lived in a royal castle until she was twelve, and spent a good time after that in a temple school for young ladies; she also spent time under Yennefer's personal tutelage, and presumably picked up her accent. As Estuary is essentially the middle-ground between Cockney and RP, given Ciri's divergent upbringing, this accent is actually a cleverly suitable choice.</li><li> Similarly, Emhyr speaking in RP makes sense, as he spent most of his youth in the North and after marrying Pavetta, he lived in Cintra. He didn't return to his homeland until he was much older, and thus doesn't speak in the Russian/Germanic accent of Nilfgaard.</li><li> The Nilfgaardians mostly speak with an approximate Russian/Germanic accent, which provides good contrast with the mostly British-accented Temerians, and marks them out as an invading foreign power. Their language, Elder Speech, however is somewhat reminiscent of Welsh.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0t8os');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0t8os" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0t8os');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It only <em>looks</em> like Welsh though, many words are derived from other European languages such as German and Dutch.</span></li><li> Skellige is inhabited by the game's resident Vikings analogue, but they have some Celtic influences in their dress and naming conventions, speaking with Irish accents.</li><li> Geralt himself and other Witchers, along with Triss and Dandelion, adopted a "Rivian" accent in-universe, which is approximate to an American accent. Given the lack of American General accent being used in traditional fantasy milieu, the accent choice makes the Witchers come across as 'otherly' even more than other creatures which helps further emphasize the line the Witchers straddle between men and monsters.</li><li> The <em>Blood and Wine</em> expansion is primarily set in the distant land of Toussaint, the game's (southern) France/Italy analogue, and the locals sport an interesting kind of Franco/Germanic (in-universe, Nilfgaardian) accent.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>: Geralt can call his horse, Roach, from anywhere in the world, and she will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">arrive in short order</a>, even if she had to cross rivers, mountains and oceans from the other side of the map. This, combined with her invulnerability, is all for the sake of convenient gameplay. This is lampshaded in-game during the quest "Equine Phantoms" in the Blood and Wine expansion where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Geralt now being able to understand Roach after taking a special concoction asks Roach about it, to which Roach simply states that she will simply go wherever Geralt is as long as he needs her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth">Accidental Truth</a>: When chatting with Zoltan and another dwarf about fishing, Geralt can joke that the Witcher's method of doing so is using bombs. Turns out that Lambert was actually doing that. In the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Empress Ciri ending</span> you can actually do this yourself on a frozen lake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDance">Charles Dance</a> (Emperor Emhyr) described his character as "the most powerful man in the land, who speaks very little but his word speaks volumes".

For example, one troll just outside of Oxenfurt was "recruited" by soldiers to guard boats they stole from peasants. The troll proudly agreed, but when the peasants came to reclaim their boats and started fighting the guards, the troll accidentally killed <em>everyone</em> simply trying to break up the fight and then ate them in a stew since otherwise all that meat would go to waste.

One ability allows Geralt to parry bolts and arrows if he's blocking, which eases things somewhat. You can upgrade this to let you send projectiles back at the attacker. Killing an archer with their own arrow is <em>incredibly</em> satisfying.<ul><li> Played straight for enemies when it comes to Geralt's crossbow. The thing is small but should still be able to kill a human with a well-placed shot, yet even the most advanced models deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> at best. It's more of a utility than a weapon, primarily meant for knocking flying monsters out of the sky so they can be shredded in close combat. The crossbow's uselessness as a damage dealer is what makes unlocking one specific achievement so frustrating - it requires Geralt to kill twenty enemies with crossbow headshots.<ul><li> This is inverted underwater however. The crossbow is the only weapon that works underwater and in lower difficulties it will one shot anything.

Once they are made, they permanently stay in your inventory. Blade oils have infinite uses, the only limit being how many attacks you can land before the oil rubs off. Even then, if you max the Fixative skill then blade oils last indefinitely while you have the skill active. Potions, decoctions, and bombs all have limited uses, but the level 2 and level 3 recipes for potions and bombs increase the number of uses you have. One of the decoctions that can be brewed, the Cockatrice Decoction, increases the uses of all your bombs and potions by 1 for the duration. Having a max rank Efficiency skill increases the number of bombs you carry by 5 while active. When you meditate while having strong alcohol such as alcohest in your inventory, then all of your spent potions, decoctions, and bombs are restocked.</li><li> Killing monsters now fully counts as researching them, though this was creeping in from the previous game.</li><li> It is possible for some characters to die or otherwise leave the game before Geralt has had an opportunity to challenge them to a game of Gwent (in order to fulfill the various Gwent quests). In some - but not all - cases, the needed card can be found near where the character was located.</li><li> Most characters who you have to escort/follow will actually accelerate up to the pace you set, allowing you to complete these segments at full running speed and removing much of the frustration usually associated with them.

From Geralt she had gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">a sense of simple, human decency</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Few monarchs</a> boast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">both traits</a> - which is quite a shame...</span></div><ul><li> And it can be made more sweet than bitter, or vice versa depending on whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geralt says that she'd be able to find and visit him easily, or that it needs to be goodbye</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Empress Ciri's visit in Blood and Wine also push this toward sweet even further: Emhyr has mellowed out considerably and their relationship improved to the point that she accidentally call him papa.</span></li></ul></li><li> The good ending of the Bloody Baron's questline. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The good news? Anna survives the Crones' wrath, the Baron and Tamara take the first faltering steps to possibly understanding each other, the Baron resolves to travel to the Blue Mountains in order to find a way to heal Anna's shattered mind while also swearing to be a better man for her, Downwarren is saved from the spirit of the Whispering Hillock, and Geralt manages to give a decisive middle finger to the Crones. The bad news? A bunch of blameless orphans are dead, Anna has become prematurely-aged and deeply traumatised from her ordeal (potentially beyond recovery) and with the Baron away, there's now nothing his army holding back from engaging in all the murder, looting and raping they want.</span></li><li> The only ending that doesn't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have either Emhyr or Radovid winning, is the one where you side with Sigi Dijkstra when he confronts Vernon Roche and the Temerian patriots. The catch is it requires Geralt to stand by and let Dijkstra kill his comrades from <em>The Witcher 2</em> and sees Temeria lose its independence forever but at the same time, you get to see Radovid die, Emhyr assassinated and the end of Nilfgaardian expansion, the end of Radovid's genocide against non-magic people, while Dijkstra builds a new Redania as Chancellor that pushes forth a campaign of development in favor of cities over towns, modernizing Redania on Nilfgaardian lines. Likewise, Ciri is free to roam the land as a Witcheress without her father and Nilfgaard tracking to her to force her to live a life she doesn't want</span>.</li><li> The quest "Towerful of Mice" ends on a sadly bittersweet note if the player makes the right choices. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A girl who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a> by rats has come back as a vengeful wraith and is haunting the island tower. By bringing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFlame">Old Flame</a> back to explain he never willfully abandoned her and make amends, the curse is lifted with a kiss of true love, and the man dies. The girl's last appearance suggests she can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">finally move on with him</a>.</span></li><li> A meta example: once the game is complete, the player may continue exploring the world and even take on some unfinished secondary quests and contracts, but all the major story-related characters in the game are removed, so you can't go around and say hi to Zoltan, for example. Kaer Morhen and the Rosemary and Thyme pub become particularly depressing places post-game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>: The Nithing quest in Skellige where a child is cursed to die is caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Woman Scorned</a> whom the victim's father used for a decade to take care of him before running off with another woman</span>. If choosing to save the child, Geralt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">calls the father out for his actions, but says that this isn't the comeuppance that he deserves</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">Black Comedy Rape</a>: In-universe, a group of drunken soldiers will share a story about how one of them chanced upon a farmer whose son was exceptionally pretty. The other soldiers speculate the farmer was trying to pass his daughter off as a son. The "punchline" is that the soldier didn't care and raped them anyway. You can practically hear the disgust in Geralt's head.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">Bloodier and Gorier</a>: The first two games had their fair share, but this game takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with enemies frequently being decapitated, bloodily impaled, losing limbs, or even being cut in half in combat (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade">not</a></em> along skeletal joints).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoatsIntoBuildings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoatsIntoBuildings">Boats into Buildings</a>: A Downplayed example occurs when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">rock troll</a> is accidentally recruited by the Redanian army and joins up with a unit who are trying to protect a fleet of boats that have been "requisitioned" from some peasants. In an unusually literal case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>, the troll decides "boats guard boats!" and rips some of the boats apart to use the timber to build a crude fence to protect the rest of fleet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>:<ul><li> Uma is a horrifically deformed individual. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In reality, he's a statuesque elf who has been cursed. The game does not shy away from indicating that undoing the curse causes major physical damage to the already-damaged individual.</span></li><li> Wraiths and other specters are particularly horrific to look at with their dislocated jaws and other physical maladies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning">Book Burning</a>: The Eternal Fire has instituted such a program in Novigrad.

It becomes even more useful when wearing armor with high resistances, due to how damage is calculated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, this the point of Signs in general. While not as powerful or flashy as the spells mages and sorceresses can do, they are quick and can be cast with one hand, making them very useful in the middle of combat.</li><li> Heart of Stone added Enchanting which provide all kind of unique effects to weapons and armor. The most popular of those however are the Preservation and Deflection both of which are level 1.</li><li> Gwent standard hero card (i.e. without special effect) is this later on: They are just solid attack card that are not affected by scorch and weather but also not boosted by Commander's horn and don't bring anything extra to the table.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a>:<ul><li> Leshen wander the forests of Velen, often in close proximity to areas related to quests of much lower level. It's almost considered a rite of passage by players to get shred to pieces in a couple of hits by accidentally engaging a Leshen 10 levels above you (and let's remember that levels in this game are exponential). The fact that it likes to attack from a distance, that attacking his pack of wolves (usually lvl 5 that you'll have no trouble taking care of) inadvertently engages the Leshen, the overall creepiness factor and his natural camouflage, it all works to its advantage to make it one of the scariest random enemies you'll find and often leave players wondering what the hell just happened or what exactly killed them, specially since Leshen attack by making roots pop out of the ground, so it's quite possible to die without ever even seeing the Leshen (and you don't get a Bestiary entry for them until <em>after</em> you've killed one). Some players seek then out to fight them again just because of how memorable the fights with them usually are. It's one of the reasons why Leshen were chosen to be included in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MonsterHunterWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MonsterHunterWorld">Monster Hunter: World</a></em> crossover event.</li><li> A few of the random Gwent players have end-game level decks with the corresponding AI to know how to use them. There's no way to tell which players have these decks until after you play them. A prime example is the unnamed merchant in Novigrad who sells Aeramas' artifacts, who has a perfect Nilfgaard deck full of spies, decoys and scorch cards. He, like the other random Gwent players, needs to be defeated to complete your deck. In similar vein, Fergus has an abysmal deck that he can't play, while Yoana will be probably the first character to beat Geralt without any hassle. What could this possibly mean...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>: The leader cards you win in the Passiflora Gwent tournament amount to this. You need to beat almost all available players in order to assemble a good enough deck to win the tournament. By the time you win the leader cards, however, there will be very few opponents left to play with. Worse, the tournament in Toussaint forces you to play with the new Skellige deck.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">Breakable Weapons</a>: Subverted.

His reaction appears to be because slaying monsters <em>is his job</em> and he resents the implication he wouldn't have killed the creature had he not been compelled.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen">Couldn't Find a Pen</a>: During a small quest you find an abandoned house where a guard was kidnapped and stuck in the cellar, however his captors were apparently killed by drowners so he writes a note in his blood explaining what happened to him and his soldiers before he dies of thirst.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>: It almost goes without saying in this setting but <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> is significantly darker than both the original game and its sequel, which is no mean feat. The country is ravaged by war, poverty, famine, disease, social injustice, racism, and worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrows">Creepy Crows</a>: Carrion birds are often seen representing ancient and sinister powers. They serve the Crones of the Crookback Bog, as well as Leshens, and these creatures can turn into flocks of ravens at will. Yennefer's magical exertions at the game's beginning also involve a black-feathered bird.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>: Witchers use specialized gears for maximum effectiveness. As such, using them outside of their respective roles brings very little to the table. The Steel and Silver swords is not at all effective against monster and human respectively. The Crossbow is exceptional for bringing down flying enemies and underwater combat but rubbish on land. Moon Dust bomb is the best tool for making Wraith corporeal - better than Yrden - but the damage is likewise pitiful. Picking which tool to use for each situation is what make the Witcher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a>.<ul><li> Armor works the same way.

As such, curb stomping becomes commonplace when you approach a mission in which the "level-ending monster" is at Level 15 and you're already at Level 25. Intentionally lampshaded when a character afterwards talks to Geralt about how difficult the just-completed fight was, even if in reality the monster was dispatched with only a few strikes by Geralt. The game actually penalizes the player for this by scaling down the amount of experience points awarded if one waits too long before completing a mission; a Level 10 quest that might award 500 points to a Level 10 player gives a mere 1 or 2 points for a Level 20 who takes it on.</li><li> Due to being somewhat overpowered, Ciri's fights are usually this, at least in Act 1 and 2 of the game. It's not until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she has to fight three powerful witch-crones at once</span> in Act 3 that a major challenge is presented to her. One reason for this is that since nearly all of Ciri's Act 1 playable appearances are presented as flashbacks, it would break continuity (not to mention render the game's main arc moot) to have her killed off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">Cutting Off the Branches</a>: Both averted and played straight. Geralt's actions in previous games have been rendered mostly moot by the fact the Nilfgaard army has steamrolled over almost half of the North.

In this game, there are quests to deal with Noonwraiths and Nightwraiths that are causing problems, but while they had similarly tragic and undeserved ends, they're so far gone that they can only be put down violently.</li><li> The series, both books and games, is infamous for the fact that Geralt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a>. Try to seduce both Triss and Yennefer, and they propose a threesome, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">handcuff Geralt to the bed, and mutually dump him</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>:<ul><li> The Continent is, as usual, racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and anti-intellectual. Nilfgaard is slightly better, but they are waging an unprovoked war of aggression, and their soldiers still engage in raping and looting (just not quite as much as the Northern Realms).</li><li> The Skellige Isles are a <em>lot</em> more egalitarian than the rest of the mainland (note the women-at-arms labeled "Shieldmaidens" about the towns), being a more friendly place than the other areas of the game, and it's notable as being ruled over by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> who Geralt is on very good terms with. Even so, it still has its own cultural norms that don't match modern society's.<ul><li> Women are traditionally expected to immolate themselves to death as a standard funerary rite for their husbands, a practice that both Yennefer and Birna find appalling. In fairness, even most of Skellige finds this practice outdated; when Bran's younger wife immolates herself, multiple people try and stop her, and Birna (as the elder wife) gets a lot of scorn for not stopping her or taking her place.</li><li> Kinsmen of criminals are cast out from society at best, and outright executed at worst, regardless of their personal involvement, judgment or knowledge of the crime in question. This applies even if the kinsmen themselves expose the wrongdoing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Svanrige Bran can attest to in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> entry below.</span></li><li> In many taverns and feasts in Skellige, the player will often find a scantily-clad dancer with the "name" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Captive</a>. Further, it's stated by other Skelligers that they commonly take "wenches" during raids, often to take as their brides and sometimes simply to "make use" of them. Absolutely no one has anything negative to say about this practice, although Geralt can look slightly puzzled.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">Dem Bones</a>: You never fight actual skeletons in the game, but the Wild Hunt itself has its armor styled to look like skeletons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>: The Scoia'tael, which played a big part in the previous two games and whom Geralt had the option to ally with, serve no role in the story here, and are only involved in a couple of side quests. Neither Iorveth nor Yaevinn make any appearances.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geralt</span> crosses it in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ciri dies ending</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a>:<ul><li> Certain quests will end if finished before taking it, but information gained <em>during</em> that quest can be used to go elsewhere and pick up on a new thread, or simply see its conclusion unfold.</li><li> There's also a lot of thought put into simple, physical effects. If you try to run into Yennefer's teleport in Vizima, for example, you get transported elsewhere in the palace.</li><li> In the "Princess in Distress" quest, there's a bear to slay to proceed. If the bear is slain before taking the quest, Geralt will comment on it.</li><li> Doing quest events out of order (such as killing a beast that was unintentionally part of a contract) has the diary note variations of "Geralt found the beast during his travels".</li><li> The first clue in the quest "Skellige's Most Wanted" that something is amiss is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can request a maximum additional reward from the quest giver and they accept automatically. Everyone else will have their "annoyance" meter raised and only accept a payment closer to the middle of the range of payment.</span></li><li> If Geralt is wearing Cat School Witcher gear during "Where the Cat and Wolf Play", Gaetan will comment on it.</li><li> If Geralt explores an area (such as a room or cavern) and finds items or a landmark before a mission takes him there, he'll often reference this in dialogue. For example, the mission "Novigrad Dreaming" takes Geralt to a Haunted House. He can go straight to the person he needs to meet, or he can explore the basement and other rooms first. If he does the latter, this changes his dialogue when the mission requires him to find items in the house; he'll remember having seen them and say where they were ("I saw a cot on the second floor.").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu">Did We Just Have Tea with Cthulhu?</a>: That shifty-looking fellow named Gaunter O'Dimm, who you shared a drink and a few words with at the very beginning of the game? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He turns out to be a soul-stealing evil sharing a number of characteristics with the Biblical Satan.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a>: The Battle of Kaer Morhen is built up as the finale.

Which, given one of the largest persecutions of Jews in Europe was the Spanish Inquisition, actually isn't so far-fetched a parallel as you might think.

By the admission of both Geralt and Triss, the latter took advantage of the former's amnesia in many ways - one of which was getting him in bed (albeit willingly at the time) for up to a year. In story, this is treated as Geralt getting lucky with a sorceress babe. In particular, Yennefer always lashes out at Geralt when the subject of Triss is brought up, and in one case reminding her that you had amnesia at the time leads to her assaulting you with a teleportation portal, resulting in Geralt being dumped from dozens of foot in the air into the nearby lake. Geralt has no option to respond negatively to this, his two options being to apologize to Yen for even bringing it up or a snarky comment about how nice the view was. To which Yen responds by <em>threatening to murder him</em> next time he tries to use the amnesia excuse. No one ever regards Triss as being wrong for what she did, other than Triss herself. Even she doesn't really treat it with as much weight as you'd expect and potentially ends up as Geralt's love interest in spite of it; it's very unlikely that mainstream audiences would find this acceptable were the genders reversed.</li><li> This attitude has some justification <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> for those who don't know the full story: Geralt is infamously promiscuous and sleeps with others for less, Triss and Geralt are a genuinely loving and sacrificing couple, and Geralt has slept with Triss during one of his "breaks" with Yennefer before.

Ciri will not be confident in her fight against the White Frost, leading to her death. In Geralt's grief, he hunts down the final Crone of Crookback Bog, taking down ten relatively innocent peasants before killing her with extreme prejudice and retrieving Ciri's old Wolf Medallion.

This was used to justify his level-grinding to higher levels. The second game had a somewhat organic feel because everything was scaled to your level. The third game dispenses with this and just places high-level monsters all over the place which Geralt must avoid til later levels. Given he is, at this point, the greatest warrior on his world and has all of his memories back, this is just plain weird.</li><li> This can apply to all three games but, in the story of the books, monsters are becoming less and less common in the Witcher's world, making Witchers less and less necessary. Yet the game series portrays a world absolutely brimming with monstrous creatures. Justified, as one of the main reason that monsters are rare is because walled cities and large armies can easily deal with external threats and drive back the monsters. With the war ravaging the countryside, large armies being focused on the battlefield instead of protecting the local populations, the monsters are making a comeback. Notably, throughout the games, one of the most common monsters types are necrophages, which thrive in the war situation that is tearing through the North.</li><li> Story-wise, Geralt and the other witchers are supposed to be quite poor given that most of what they earn killing monsters has to be spent on accomodation and preparing potions and such for the next fight. In spite of this, Geralt can easily earn thousands of crowns in the course of the game and have little to spend it on other than improved gear. The economy apparently only works this way for Geralt: Gaetan the Cat School Witcher reveals that he was offered 12 crowns for a leshen contract, which barely covered the cost of the potions he used in the fight. Geralt is routinely offered ten times that for a contract, plus a bit more if he haggles, and can easily earn far more than 12 crowns by killing a group of low-level bandits, looting their cheap gear and sell it to a merchant or simply picking herbs and berries for potions in the woods and selling them to an alchemist.</li><li> There is also the fact Geralt doesn't have to eat or pay any sort of fees for renting a place to sleep (or sleep at all) or for Roach's fodder, thus cutting off the regular Witcher expenditures.</li><li> Story Geralt despises thieves and there are numerous occasions where the player can choose to kill a thief or group of thieves. Gameplay Geralt will loot the houses of the poorest peasants, the docks of every major city, brothels, banks, herbalists, blacksmiths, army headquarters, and multiple ruler's castles, stealing everything he can get his hands on. There is one mission in the Blood and Wine expansion where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geralt can grave rob an entire crypt worth of loot, while also taking the time to murder a couple groups of grave robbers after insulting them for being grave robbers.</span> It's even lampshaded by the game during which an NPC inquires about Geralt's sudden wealth and asks if he's ever gone through other people's belongings. To which the player can respond "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Never in my life</a>".</li><li> Rescuing Ves at Mulbrydale requires you to slaughter Nilfgaardian soldiers, but in the ensuing cutscene and afterwards once you're done you'll see Nilfgaardians just standing around totally cool with you having just killed their comrades.</li><li> In a related note, the "Abandoned Location" quests require you to clear the area of enemies (monsters or bandits usually) so the populace can return. However the cutscene showing people moving back triggers as soon as you hit the final blow on the last enemy. Which has the bizarre situation where people are moving about their day and children are playing on top of bloody dismembered corpses and monster entrails scattered all over the place.<ul><li> Thankfully this was fixed in Toussaint and in an unexpected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a> feature, a cutscene reloads the map after these areas are cleared, showing time passing by and later villagers are shown restoring the damaged buildings, corpses being loaded onto a wagon, with people understandably crying over them, at least one vendor NPC will always effusively thank Geralt for helping them and other realistic touches to make the transition less jarring.</li></ul></li><li> Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a> method mentioned before of just raising the level of enemies to keep you away from certain areas it can be pretty jarring to find random mooks so ridiculously overpowered they could destroy early game bosses with no trouble. It's somewhat hilarious when during one of the <em>Hearts of Stone</em> quests you find an elderly couple who claim they can't fend for themselves or hunt for food, yet they're both lvl 32 and will wreck you in 2 hits if you're not properly geared and close to their level. Even more egregious is the fact that, random wolves roaming around Toussaint in packs of 5-10 are lvl <em>35</em>, that's the same level as the end game bosses and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> creatures of the main game.

Regis and Dettlaff greatly abhor killing mortals themselves, but Regis admits they both had to <em>learn</em> how to come to this viewpoint. On the other hand, though, they consider the deaths or murder of their own kind to be heinous offenses. While they're typically just annoyed or amused if a mortal destroys a higher vampire, due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">Resurrective Immortality</a>, they become <em>furious</em> when the death is permanent.

Regis asks Geralt to think of the most uncomfortable (not painful or traumatic) experience he's ever had to do, and Geralt mentions banquets and formal occasions where he has to look and act like someone he's not.

Toussaint is far more bright and colorful than anywhere in the main game. Its residents tend to be far friendlier, as opposed to those in Velen, who will throw racial slurs at Geralt, talk about how their hit their wives (the Toussaintois do this too, but not as much), or gleefully brag about burning mages and nonhumans. Even its poor and peasants lead seemingly richer lives; slums in Novigrad often leave the poor starving and hungry in the streets while vineyards have peasants singing merrily and there's at least one soup kitchen in Beauclaire. The contrast is perhaps best seen at the start of the DLC, when two knights of Toussaint protect a town in Velen from Bandits, insisting to give the bandits a chance to abandon their criminal ways, knowing the bandits will refuse, but doing this, the Knights know they did everything to avoid violence. When the bandits are defeated, Geralt notes the Velen citizens are now afraid of the knights who saved them, and will not thank them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightFeminineAndDarkFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightFeminineAndDarkFeminine">Light Feminine and Dark Feminine</a>: The ducal sisters; Anna Henrietta is the light, and Sylvia Anna is the dark.
