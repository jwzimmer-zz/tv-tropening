Its basic premise is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> the <em>Mega Man</em> universe had a major technological breakthrough in computer networking instead of robotics?" <em>MMBN</em> is set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> where everything is completely run by the Internet and life is more-or-less peaceful. Everything &mdash; cars, refrigerators, schools, the weather &mdash; <em>literally</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">Everything Is Online</a>.</p><p>The programming required to run everything has gotten so complicated that humans cannot comprehend it by themselves. So they've created helper Artificial Intelligences, called Network Navigators ("NetNavis" or "Navis" for short). The stars of the series are 10-year-old (at the start of the series) Lan Hikari and his Net Navi partner, MegaMan.EXE.</p><p>Since power in this universe is through the Internet, public enemies are those who would conquer or destroy it. Viruses are monsters that must be destroyed, and hackers are able to control all of the things mentioned above that the Internet is connected to - even the Mafia is Internet-based. Lan and MegaMan, being the main characters, have to face these forces off.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The real world and the Internet are separated from each other. Lan can help MegaMan out by giving advice and plugging in "battlechips" that grant MegaMan special powers in battle, but he is more or less isolated from the action - unless the part of the Internet that is being affected controls the environment he is currently in, like a runaway train, a cruise ship, the oven of his house, etc.</p><p>The series is best known for its unique battle system. It's complicated in theory, yet simple in practice. Combat is conducted on a three-by-six block grid, with MegaMan on the left and his enemies on the right. When your meter fills up, you can select a certain number of battle chips to blast your enemies in real time while dodging their attacks. They can damage, heal, claim more territory for you, damage or remove enemy territory, summon assistants, and a host of other effects. Those are the basics, at least. It would take far too long to explain all the little clever details and tactical considerations (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">insane unstoppable ultra-combos</a>), so those interested should watch some videos to have a better idea of what it's like.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The series lasted for six games before concluding, and is the second series in the Mega Man franchise to reach a proper conclusion. It spawned a sequel series focusing on radio waves and set 200 years in the future, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a></em>.</p><p>There are several attempts to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanGame">Fan Game</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel">continuation</a>.

In the aforementioned water incident in the first game, it appears that <strong>no one</strong> has a stock pile of water bottles in case of a water shortage (a very common tactic in real life) and the government is less than useless as they don't provide emergency water rations. It takes two 11-year-old (one is admittedly part of the government) to end the crisis.</li><li> Speaking of the government, SciLab (which is technically only partly funded by the government).

The only exception is in the Power Plant dungeon. Later games removed this feature. However, on the fourth game onward there exists a Navi Customizer Program that you can equip to make MegaMan recover a few HP whenever he finishes a Virus Busting. In the fifth game, winning a battle with a "residual battle data" of your partner will recover his HP to full. Also sometimes, if your HP is low enough at the end of the battle, the battle reward may change to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode">a big HP recovery instead</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInARow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInARow">All in a Row</a>: In <em>Double Team DS</em>, your chosen battle data of your Navi ally will follow you around the net as semi-transparent running sprites.

The character's eyes are rounded instead of semicircular (most prominent on MegaMan) and the shapes of their bodies feel more slender and less blocky, though the recurring characters are prone to some wacky, far-fetched expressions on their mugshots. The games themselves shrink down sprite dimension and gain thick outlines to create a crisp feel of objects.

An excellent example is the Master Style Program Advance from BN3 which did almost a full thousand damage to the enemy and looked very flashy, but was very gimmicky. You needed four chips, all of them Mega class (only one of each per folder, and they steal the space for any other Mega chips), if MegaMan wanted to use any of the chips individually he had to be in the right style (so only one could be used by itself in a single fight), and each of these chips had a very specific individual gimmick, like the need for field obstacles or holes. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> Master Cross from Battle Network is vastly superior, utilizing four powerful <em>Standard</em> class chips that all fit easily into the same folder and can be individually used painlessly.</li><li> Many Program Advances also involve selecting 3 or more copies of the same chip with different codes, usually in alphabetical order.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ofvh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ofvh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ofvh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">e.g. Cannon A + B + C = Zeta/Giga Cannon</span> There are a few problems with these kind of Program Advances. Firstly, the Zeta series work by putting you in an invincibility phase while using a certain chip under a time limit. While this is supposedly a neat feature, most bosses have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> and the attack speed for some chips are painfully slow that you can only attack them with that Program Advance once or twice at most before the timer runs out. Secondly, due to chip selection rules, the player cannot select any other chips to use in the same turn, like attack-boosting chips which would otherwise make the Program Advance much more potent. This also means that it's harder to use these chips alone if you're using a folder with only one chip code.</li><li> The Dark Messiah PA in the final game is a nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to <em>Battle Network 2</em>. It summons Dark MegaMan to attack with Gospel Breath, then follows up with a Dark Sword, courtesy of Bass. Problem is, it actually does <em>less damage</em> than if the chips it's made up from were used individually!</li><li> Several individual <em>chips</em> also count, either because they have an awkward attack angle, require specific conditions to meet their massive damage output, or are marred by inconvenient codes when a player is trying to optimize folder fluidity.</li><li> Magnetman's Liberation ability lets him shield the party from attacks outside of battle for a turn at the cost of a rare Order Point... and Magnetman's turn. Since field damage is pitiful and can't bring HP below 1, it's very rarely worthwhile to use it instead of choosing to liberate a panel.</li><li> Beast Over in the sixth game turns Mega Man invincible and lets him attack automatically (though out of your control). It has the potential to do a lot of damage, but 1) you need to have spent 3 turns in Beast Out to be able to use Beast Over, by which point you may have already defeated all enemies 2) it ends automatically when the Custom Gauge fills up, and 3) it leaves MegaMan exhausted, resetting his Buster stats and causing his HP to drop rapidly.

The most famous of these is the Variable Sword and Neo Variable Sword. The timing to input this code is shortly after using the chip, while holding the A button, and can be interrupted by enemy attacks, so it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired">some physical skill to input the more complex commands while under fire.</a><ul><li> Variable Sword on its own would be unremarkable, a single-panel sword chip that simply has an uncommonly high attack rating of 160.

If this seems a little broken to you, don't worry, Battle Network 4 went and Nerfed it for you, spawning off the "Neo Variable" Mega Chip for more "advanced" players (though we will admit the NeoVar ignores shields and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a>).</li><li> <em>Battle Network 3</em> gave secret attacks to the Guts Punch series (which activates when you enter the traditional command for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Hadouken</a> when using the first chip) and the MetalMan Navi Chip's code allows you to place MetalMan's short-ranged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fist</a> almost anywhere on the field.</li><li> The secret Punk Navi Chip from BN3 will allow you to use any of Punk's natural attacks, depending on which code you use.</li><li> Custom Sword has a wide range and can potentially deal up to around 250 damage, but its strength is tied into how much the Custom Gauge is filled, scaling at an exponential rate until it drops back to 0 once the gauge fills. Careful timing is needed to use it effectively.</li><li> Protoman from BN5 is a lot harder to use than Colonel, due to his charge shot being a Widesword and having a non-upgraded buster shot. To compensate for this, he has a shield that reflects damage if you press both back and B at the same time, similar to Mega's from Shield Style or with the Navicust program. It's much more difficult, but conversely, it's much more powerful once you get used to it.</li></ul></li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Outside of those things, the main games are pretty easy if you're actually exploring, collecting powerups, updating your folder, and so forth - suddenly being at high risk of dying from any of those things even when well prepared is a pretty significant difficulty spike.

The first game is very forgiving up until the final areas, and with a good folder even the more difficult bosses can be blitzed down before they get too wild &mdash; but the second one stops pulling punches very early on, and the third lays into you right out of the starting gate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>:<ul><li> Taken to an insane degree in the Virtual Console versions of BN2 and BN3; because there's no real way for virtual console players to get at certain exclusive chips, the programmers provided them <em>for free</em>. This gift includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> event-exclusive chips, some of which never even made it overshores to America in the original games!</li><li> In all games featuring the Number Trader (the Aster Trader in BN6), with an online guide to tell you the Lotto Numbers you can get rare and powerful chips and Navicust programs early in the game.</li><li> In the sixth game, in the very first area, you can obtain from the random encounters 5 Reflector1 As and 5 Machine Gun1 As. These, along with three Train Arrow As you can get in another early area (and SpoutMan if you're playing <em>Falzar</em>), can and will see you through the entire game.</li><li> In general, if you're willing to spend a bit of time grinding, you can assemble dual or monocoded folders very early in the game, which significantly reduces the challenge.</li><li> In <em>Network Transmission</em>, the Mini Bomb chip is for once actually useful. To be certain, against bosses it's not so hot but it's capable of pretty much destroying or at least crippling every basic enemy in the game that doesn't have an aura since it hits more than once. And the best part? You can get it at the beginning of the game since Higsby sells it for a measly 150 zenny. And since its a beginning chip, you can hold up to 30 and easily set it as your regular chip.</li><li> As another general rule, Mega Chips (the ones you get by (re)beating bosses, and a few others with similar power level) run the gamut, but many are capable of winning random encounters in one move for much of the game. Many hit the entire screen or a good portion of it and do lots of damage and/or disable enemies. The 3 chips for the first boss of <em>BN6</em>, for instance, hit all three rows for 120+ damage and the first area with enemies with more health than the chip takes off is the wood area, where everyone takes double damage from fire. In <em>BN3</em> the first boss's chip does 50+ damage to the whole screen, double on ice or vs water, while guard state and mercy invincibility and inflicting paralysis. To make up for this, though, you can't rely on getting these chips every battle; you'll just have a 5-7 in 40 chance of ending every random encounter in one turn for each chip like that you posess.</li><li> <em>BN6</em> is full of these. The Cross is acquired relatively early compared to other <em>BN</em> games upgrade and has arguably the best and most useful effect and can be used just by pressing up on Custom Screen. It's also possible to beat the V3 version of the first boss in <em>BN6</em> especially easier in the <em>Falzar</em> version after getting the first Cross in a matter of seconds. You can get the full power version if you grind the correct chip and said correct chip is in the beginning area. At full power, the chip does 250 damage to the whole column.</li><li> A bit of grinding and searching in the earliest portion of the games will net you the ingredients of a Program Advance, generally Zeta/Giga-Cannon1. It's also possible to put together a Flame Hook and Fire Burner P.A. in <em>6</em> before BlastMan.</li><li> The Lifesword Program Advance is available pretty early on in all games, and can wipe out pretty much everything it touches for half the game (up to and including the first boss or two).</li><li> In the first game, some solid dueling against Gutsman early in the game can net you five V3 Gutsman chips, which hit the entire screen for much more damage than most enemies can withstand.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw">Discard and Draw</a>:<ul><li> The "Add" function in the second and third game are a literal iteration of the trope &mdash; you essentially discard your loaded chips and fight one turn without any chips so that your Custom Screen is expanded on future turns.</li><li> MegaMan's transformations undergo this trope between games, discarding Style Changes for Soul Unisons between <em>3</em> and <em>4</em>, and then switching to Crosses between <em>5</em> and <em>6</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some say his destruction and recovery at the end of <em>3</em> led to the loss of the chng.bat data, and by extension, his Style Changes.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlothole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlothole">Dub Induced Plothole</a>:<ul><li> Why are ProtoMan, EraseMan, and SpoutMan in the B, K and A codes?

Even excluding the questionably canonical and unquestionably grandiose post-game content, Lan and Mega confront and undo high-profile, international crime organizations and global catastrophes at least half-a-dozen times in two years... and yet are only consistently recognized by small groups of individuals, usually the villains. The rest of the world &mdash; even the boys' own hometown &mdash; treats them like normal kids.<ul><li> The Officials organization consistently treats Lan as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid">Just a Kid</a>, even when, as an international police force that he occasionally allies with, they have direct knowledge of all of his world-saving feats.</li><li> It's worth pointing out Chaud and ProtoMan, the heroes' peers and primary rivals, are the consistent recipients of all the prestige that by rights belongs to Lan and Mega. The games will often go out of their way to pimp the rivals over and above the heroes, no matter how many times you canonically show them up. A good example is in <em>Battle Network 4</em> when during one particular scenario some Officials talk about "Electopia's Ace" &mdash; do they mean repeat world-saver and (currently in-universe) national champion Lan Hikari? No, they mean Chaud.</li><li> Chaud himself tends to zig-zag on this, treating them like minor nuisances even after they do his job better than he does. Thanks to character development, he and ProtoMan grow more willing to recognize Team Lan and Mega's significance as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, even going so far as to recruit them for a specialized task force in <em>Team ProtoMan</em>.</li><li> <em>Battle Network 3</em>:<ul><li> Lan's friends and the villains make repeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> to the fact that Lan and Mega have heroic feats under their belt, and during the N-1 Grand Prix the boys are noted &mdash; on worldwide television, no less &mdash; to be world-saving heroes. But most people still treat them like normal kids, and the next game behaves as if nothing ever really happened. (Incidentally, the entire N1 Grand Prix scenario is actually about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">Chaud</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">Lan's really just there to watch</a>).</li><li> The FlameMan scenario near the end of the game deliberately gives Lan recognition in the form of an award for a prior in-game feat of heroism... as a set up to force him to make himself complicit of the most contrived examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a> in the series.

Just slap the prefix "cyber" in front of the usual term. Heck, some Navis are even capable of <em>cooking</em>. You know, because programs get hungry too (apparently).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10bk0v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10bk0v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10bk0v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Though Mega's brief comment about how hungry he was in the first game is quite the foreshadowing tool... </span><ul><li> Malware that blocks programs from transmitting data is often represented by chains or obstructions, like the boulders StoneMan.EXE uses to disrupt the rail service in the first game. Removing the malware involves <em>shooting at it</em> to destroy it and 'unblock' the system, allowing it to function again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">Fake Longevity</a>: Plenty of examples...<ul><li> The backtracking. Most of the Real World segments in the first game are running back and forth between a few areas. The Waterworks stage is likewise hated for this.</li><li> The castle stage in the second game, which features zombies, vampires, and burglars harassing you. In the Zombies' case, they take you across the map...and the map seems artificially lengthened.</li><li> Any part of the third game that involves the Energy Change program. To clear the related obstacles, not only does the player need to install the aforementioned Navicust program, but they also need to use up a chip of the relevant element. While the hospital stage during Plantman's scenario generously provides virus encounters that drop relevant chips, Flameman's scenario takes you across different parts of the internet without changing virus encounters. Run out of Aqua chips during the latter scenario? Back to grinding.</li><li> Attempting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> in the third game - several unique Battle Chips cannot be acquired unless you're using the appropriate <em>Style</em>, and considering that the player can only hold 1 Style at a time, it results in more grinding to be able to roll for the one they seek. This can be dodged by using the Bugfrag Trader and getting all other chips to abuse its 25% chance of giving a new chip, but this ends up just changing it from encounter grinding to bugfrag grinding.</li><li> Almost all of the fourth game is made of this, due to Lan taking on problems from his competitors. Battle Network 4 uses a tournament mechanic that has no central plot. These tournaments will take place repeatedly throughout the game, and have three scenarios<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11b9yj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11b9yj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11b9yj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Randomly chosen from a pool of six in specific combinations of three which themselves have no necessary order</span> that do nothing&mdash;nothing <em>whatsoever</em>&mdash;to actually advance the plot<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12jfv2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12jfv2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12jfv2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The SearchMan and ProtoMan scenarios in <em>Red Sun</em> and <em>Blue Moon</em> do have some reference to Nebula, and the ProtoMan scenario even foreshadows <em>Bass</em> (you can see his statue near the area where you find ProtoMan). Neither, however, have any real effect on the plot, and that's a total of 1 in 18 scenarios per game being relevant</span>. The plot actually happens between the tournaments, with brief snippets of Nebula harassing the Hikaris in Electopia and the meteor harassing Yuichirou at NAXA. In other words, <em>the central aspect of the game itself</em> is filler spacing out the plot. The game also uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> mechanic with a total of four cycles the player must pass through to fully unlock everything. (You can't even get to the Bass fight until the third cycle, because that's when you get your last Double Soul).</li><li> The fifth game only presents the player with first-level viruses up till the final boss, as the viruses will only upgrade to their next forms when the player opens a door to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. This forces the player to backtrack to nearly every location in the game again for the purpose of hunting down their chips and furthering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.

Magnetman and Napalmman are less than popular due to the frustrating fight without anything backing it up and being too late in the game and after the much more memorable Pharaohman as the second game&#146;s reps, respectively.

However, the game will be nice enough to give you hints on the kind of PAs you can build (does a certain chip have its chip codes all in sequence? do multiple chips in the same family have the same code?), but only rarely will you get to see an explicit recipe for one or another (usually the one for Zeta/Giga-Cannon, a bulky P.A. that can be reasonably obtained before the first boss). Past that, however, it's usually guess-and-check or check online.</li><li> Regarding the Navi Customizer, Capcom just gets <em>mean</em>. Compression codes that shrink the programs, and the Error and EX codes for BN 3's Mod Tools are incredibly obscure (A handful of Error Codes are interspersed throughout the game, but the EX Codes you'll have to look up). Later games at least had the decency of giving random NPCs or details strewn about that mention compression codes, though they don't tell you <em>which</em> program it shrinks.</li><li> A handful of Battle Chips have secret commands that unlock special functions and attack variations. The most famous of these are Variable Sword and Neo Variable, but there are others, like the Guts Punch series and the Navi Chips for BeastMan, MetalMan, and SlashMan.</li><li> And then there's the Lotto Codes for the Number Trader (which doled out free goodies for Lan and Mega in exchange for the right code); there are, again, a handful in the game, but mostly they're online. Funnily enough, even the in-game codes are placed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysCheckBehindTheChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysCheckBehindTheChair">such obscure places</a> that you have to wonder what Higsby was ever <em>doing there</em>.</li><li> Finding the Beta(<em>3</em>) and SP/DS (<em>5</em>) versions of bosses becomes this for the two games since not only they are rare random encounters, but their locations differ from their Alpha/V2 versions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandInTheHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandInTheHole">Hand in the Hole</a>: In order to prove that he's a contestant in the last tournament of the <em>BN4</em> story, Lan has to put his hand in the mouth of a stone lion face.

Sometimes getting into a secure area simply involves obtaining a security certificate. Sometimes, you have to destroy or disable components of the security system to proceed.

Some forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeGraphicalRepresentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeGraphicalRepresentation">Extreme Graphical Representation</a> are used to represent some of the malware and their effects:<ul><li> StoneMan.EXE disrupts a rail service by blocking data transmission from the master network... by dropping virtual boulders into the network space that block the 'rails' that represent the connections between the rail service systems.</li><li> ElecMan.EXE's disruption of electrical power in the network in the first game represents him hacking into the power control firmware/embedded systems at a power plant, limiting the amount of power that was being supplied to everything in the system and causing some programs to behave abnormally due to the low-power conditions.</li><li> AirMan.EXE leaves pink clouds that drain the strength of programs and slows/stops them, denying access to memory sectors.</li><li> QuickMan.EXE and his operator in the second game <em>destroy</em> virtual ground inside the embedded systems of several bombs, severing the virtual linkages and preventing you from pursuing via them.</li><li> The Mother Computer for Electopia and its protective doors actually employ a massive series of passwords that prevent access to the core program, and the systems themselves are littered with Mr. Progs that provide hints. Some of the hints are easy, and some of the hints are difficult (the final hint is actually quite complicated), but the passwords themselves are actually rather easy to bruteforce (especially via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>), since a Navi has to travel a specific path through a limited selection of characters.</li><li> MagnetMan.EXE uses virtual magnetic fields to 'spoof' magnetic current that forced data to flow through particular pathways in the system, restricting bandwidth and mobility. This also caused massive disruptions in the aircraft computer systems he was intruding, resulting in various failures throughout the plane.</li><li> FreezeMan.EXE in the second game essentially launched a nationwide Denial of Service attack by blocking the network with virtual Ice programs that froze programs and blocked access to network sectors. These Ice programs had special defensive measures to deploy normal viruses when disrupted or 'broken' by normal means. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Freeze Man himself was the Command and Control node for the entire DoS attack, so when he was deleted, the Ice programs were stopped since they could not receive more commands from him</span>.</li><li> A <em>rare</em> example of a realistic malware attack appears in the third game, where Mr Match deceives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lan</span> via social engineering. He also did this in the first game, infiltrating Lan's house to conduct an attack by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanitorImpersonationInfiltration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanitorImpersonationInfiltration">posing as a repairman performing preventive maintenance</a> in light of the recent attacks (his own). In general, Mr. Match tends towards more realistic cyber-warfare attacks, like using purpose-built malware packages designed to target specific hardware, and social engineering to get close to his targets.</li><li> In Battle Network 3, a shady Netopian hanging around Beach Street will sell you something called the "ModTools", which allow you to essentially jailbreak your Navi Customizer. In the game, leveling up a Style Change will produce special programs that can only be used by specific styles; using any program with an incompatible style will produce an error code. Using the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModTools">Mod Tools</a> will allow you to enter a password to bypass that code and use the program anyway (you can't do this for more than one such program at once, mind).

MegaMan starts the game in neutral territory, but once the Dark Chips are introduced, if Mega ever performs poorly in combat, his emotional state will become <em>Worried</em> and a pair of Dark Chips will appear in the corner of his chip menu. Choosing these will pull Mega towards Dark Power, while Mega will inevitably be pulled in the "Light" direction by performing well in battle, using Full-Synchro and Double Souls, etc. As he moves in this direction, it becomes much easier for Mega to enter Full-Synchro and harder for him to become Worried. You can see where Mega is on the scale by checking his Navi screen and seeing how he's darkened or brightened.<ul><li> That said, it should be noted that the fourth game unambiguously favors the "Light" Side. Mega on the Dark Side can use the Game Breaking Dark Chips, but they will <em>always</em> give him some kind of bug, <em>always</em> deduct one (1) hit point from his total<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20cgrj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note20cgrj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20cgrj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With the exception of the time(s) he is forced to for plot purposes</span> (which will be lost for the rest of the game), and they are useless against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.

"Ura Internet" (with "Ura" roughly translating as "reverse side", or "underworld"), is the Japanese name for the Undernet, so the names of Mamoru and the inn are meant to hint to Mamoru's connection to the Undernet, and the entrance to the Secret Area being located somewhere inside the Inn's grounds.</li><li> In <em>Battle Network 2</em>, the Netmafia Gospel's ultimate goal is to create copies of Bass, whose name in Japan is Forte. To Japanese players, Gospel's name would be a huge tip-off, since that was the name of Forte's support unit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">the original games</a>. In America, they translated Forte to Bass as always, but left Gospel's name alone, confusing the hint. Perhaps they thought that "Treble" would be an odd name for an evil shadowy organization, or they didn't want to bother with their logo, which is a "G" shaped like Gospel's head.</li><li> A minor example &mdash; the hint to find the DesertMan Beta ghost is that DesertMan "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">likes sand</a>", which tells you nothing... if you're a Western gamer. In Japan, television static or "TV Snow" is called "sand" instead.</li><li> The Larkman Program Advance needs two Katana S chips combined with a Larkman chip to work. An odd combination, unless you know that his Japanese name is Swallowman. It's a reference to the Swallow Cut, the technique of the pseudo-mythical Sasaki Kojir&#333; that was a two-stroke sword slash based on the motion of a bird's tail in flight, and consisted on a cut down followed by a cut up. The Katana chips are two-strike sword attacks, and thus combining them with Larkman results, naturally, in a divebomb swooping attack.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Luckily, My Shield Will Protect Me</a>: There are several enemies that employ shielding techniques and abilities.<ul><li> The Mettaur virus family is distinguished by its hardhat, and stronger versions of the virus will use these for protection.</li><li> There's a Shield ability that allows the user to summon a shield and negate incoming damage. A more advanced version of this ability, Reflect, will release a shockwave through the ground upon being struck.</li><li> There have also been Shield and Reflect battle chips (usually courtesy of the Mettaurs) that do the same things; the Battle Network 6 "Reflector" chips are notable for being instantaneous and air-borne, in some cases ensuring a counter-attack.</li><li> The Dominerd viruses (<em>Kaazu</em> or maybe "Curze" in Japan) are living shields that turn invisible and protect other viruses from incoming fire. Striking them will prompt them to rush to your immediate area and take a bite out of you. Their Battle Chips, the Curse Shield line, allow you to use them as personal shields.</li><li> While it's not as prominently a part of his design as the original, ProtoMan does wield a shield in battle. He's deceptively quick on the draw, too, forcing you to attack only when he does.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>: Let's take a look at Dr. Wily for a moment...<ul><li> <em>BN1</em>: Wily was at the center of an explosion that leveled his lab.

The second game reduced the amount of Battle Chips of a single type that could be in your folder from ten to five (and then to four in later games), and the third game introduced the Standard-Mega-Giga classification system, which allowed them to impose Navi Chip style restrictions on overpowered chips that they kept from old games. These attempts were mitigated in part by new Game Breakers being introduced. (Giga Chips, for example, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a>, sometimes ridiculously so).</li><li> The introduction of the Navi Customizer manages to do this in a couple of cases, such as making Mega's formerly permanent Power Ups into optional enhancements.

This removes Megaman's ability to jack out, making it necessary for him to run back to the jack-in point to get back into the PET. It also removes the possibility for Lan to send Battle Chip data to Megaman, leaving him with his Mega Buster to defend himself. Thankfully, this happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">ACDC Area</a>, with comparatively weak random encounters.

However, in the sidescrolling spinoff, <em>Transmission</em>, it's actually really easy to hit with, and the explosion hits several times for full damage within the space of about a second, meaning one single bomb can destroy almost every random enemy in the game not protected by some sort of aura. It's also easy to get, has a low MP cost, and you can carry a ton with you.

However, against Protectos in <em>2</em> it makes you invulnerable since it always regenerates in time to block their explosions, giving you the time to assemble the combo you need; the infrequency of Nebula Grey's stronger attacks also makes Bubble Wrap a great defensive option against it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDisabledInVR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDisabledInVR">Not Disabled In VR</a>: Of a sort; the wheelchair-bound Mamoru really likes NetBattles because he gets put on a more even playing field with his opponent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">Not the Intended Use</a>:<ul><li> Navi Customizer bugs are intended to be punishment for using the NaviCust incorrectly, but not all of them are that punishing. Deliberately glitching the elemental hunt programs (Jungle for Wood viruses, for example) will lower the encounter rate for viruses of that element. Bugging the Humour program in the latter half of the series causes MegaMan's "mood" to change at random, allowing the player to semi-reliably deal double damage because it was on Full Synchro or Anger for a few seconds. You can also bug Mega's buster, which causes him to fire silly things like squirts of water or bouquets of flowers. One form of the glitch causes the charged shot to create Rock Cubes, which can be airshot or punched into enemies for 200 damage.</li><li> A strange attribute of Punk is that the Yo-Yo attack is destroyed on contact with him, so it only hits once instead of up to three times as intended.

(Mostly averted in 3, where he's saved for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">the post-game</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss">Warm-Up Boss</a>: GutsMan, by comparison, is almost always this in his appearances. He moves slower than other enemies, only gets in your face if you get too close to his area, has the most obvious tells where you can counter him, and he is constantly vulnerable. On top of that, his primary attack is a shockwave, making him little more than a bulky Mettaur virus. You can fight him within the first ten minutes of the first game, right after the tutorial, where he has a whopping 200 HP.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>: Shadow viruses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No Sells</a> everything but sword chips. There are no in-game justifications to this, but they are the only effective options for them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">Weather-Control Machine</a>:<ul><li> Made important in <em>2</em> when the computer suppressing the planet's weather is hacked, threatening to unleash years' worth of earthquakes and storms on the planet.</li><li> Rehashed on more localized scales in <em>4</em> and <em>6</em>, natch. In these cases, however, the real-world weather disruption is part of that chapter's boss Navi's schtick (in <em>2</em> it's just a byproduct of Net-centric weirdness).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToCorneria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToCorneria">Welcome to Corneria</a>: Averted. NPC dialogue almost constantly changes, not only from chapter to chapter, but often with every triggered event flag during these chapters themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>: The third game introduces us to Chaud's father, who is cold and aloof to everyone, even his son. His introduction alone re-colors Chaud's own haughty attitude in the first two games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Throughout the series, characters simply disappear and are never mentioned again. While part of this is due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">Nominal Importance</a>, it is sometimes quite odd. Sometimes it's handwaved by mentioning the character being in jail or something along those lines.<ul><li> There's a mysterious NetNavi in <em>3</em> that forges some connection between SciLab, Bass, and Alpha. While the connection between those three entities is expounded, the Navi only appears for all of two scenes and we're never given any sort of closure regarding him.</li><li> In the second game, Arashi Kazefuki fails Gospel and the Organizations leader tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">take him down with a suitcase bomb.</a> The game explicitly mentions that the authorities didn't find any casualties associated with the bomb. However, the character doesn't appear again until the somewhat obscure Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge game which came out almost 2 years after the second game.</li><li> Also from the second game, we have "The Doc" whose real name is never mentioned. He's a genius and mysterious programmer who resides in the Undernet, he can cure Freezeman's ice, his origin is never explained, the method to summon him is to invoke his code word on the Undernet chat board (the word(s) being, rather suspiciously, "WWW"), and arrives at Koto square after Megaman beats Freezeman to give exposition. He even says that he will send a bill directly to the government officials for services rendered (and has no doubt that they will pay). With the connections and skills all that implies, you think he would pop up now and again as an ally or a villain, but he never does.</li><li> Similarly, you would think that Dr. Cossak would become more involved in the games after it's revealed that he created <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bass</span> and that he would appear to help stop him in future games. Nope. He just vanishes from the series.</li><li> Besides for Higsby, two other WWW members defected. They were Ms. Yuri, Ms. Mari's twin sister, and an old man who used to be Wily's assistant. This wouldn't be much of an issue if Lan hadn't needed Higsby to provide information on the WWW in both the second game and Transmission whereas the old man, who was with Wily since the beginning, would be much more familiar with the WWW's secrets. It could be explained as Lan not having either of their emails, but the makers of the game don't even bother with even the laziest handwave. Heck, Ms. Mari could probably have provided Lan with Yuri's contact information. You would think that the government officials would, at least, track them down for information after Lan found them tied up at Wily's base during the first game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Nope.</a></li><li> Zero from <em>Network Transmission</em> (set chronologically between the first two games) plays a major role in that game and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns to the good side if you save him. With his strong sense of justice and disdain for the WWW,</span> you would think that he would reappear later in the series right? No such luck. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Given it's entirely possible to let Zero be deleted, he might've been dead.</span></li><li> Other Navis that don't reappear or are mentioned are many of the bonus bosses from the games. These bosses often imply a hidden plot or scheme yet these plot threads never seem to travel between games (and even if the Navi does reappear, neither Megaman nor Lan recognize them, making the canon continuity of the secret areas very shaky). Oddly, by the start of the third game, Megaman could have fought the real Bass as many as <em><strong>3</strong></em> times after which Bass obviously escapes each time. However, in the third game, neither Lan nor Megaman recognize Bass from anywhere besides the fake version in the second game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a>: The series stems from the question "What if Doctor Light worked in networking instead of robotics?" Meanwhile, Doctor Wily still worked in robotics, and became fiercely jealous when Light's projects took away his funding and public interest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>: Bass.EXE nurses a powerful grudge against humanity for giving him his <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledBackstory">Dark And Troubled Backstory</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: The Undernet is filled with criminal Navis, garden-variety thugs, and even Yakuza. The closest thing it has to a ruling class is "the Ranking", which is a selection of (up to) ten NetNavis carrying ranks; prospective Ranking entrants are encouraged to fight (kill, really, but MegaMan doesn't play that way) to the last man standing before they are sent after the Rank 10 NetNavi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim">Why Don't Ya Just Shoot Him?</a>: While Lan's opponents usually hack systems from out of sight, there are still plenty of instances in which Lan and his (generally larger and tougher) opponent both send their Navis to do battle from within the same room. In the time it takes to traverse a puzzle dungeon, fight through waves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>, and defeat a boss Navi, the enemy operator apparently never thinks to punch Lan out, or something. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They figure this out, but only right before the very end of the series.</span><ul><li> Approaching this problem from the other end is the question as to why the terrorist Operators never bail when the heroes happen upon them. It requires almost no effort to Jack a Navi Out from any location, but for some reason, most Navis linger for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> that they could stand to avoid. (Some Navis get around this by needing to complete an ongoing task, like BlastMan, or not having anywhere to Jack-Out to or any means to do so, like Solo Navi BubbleMan, but some, like ElecMan appear to gratuitously waste time by sticking around after their job is done.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar">You All Look Familiar</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> at one point. Justified in the Internet world, as the regularly reused navis are supposedly "standard" models. They're occasionally used by major characters; similarly, unimportant characters like LarkMan sometimes have unique sprites.</li><li> There's a mention in <em>6</em> from the characters which notes that MegaMan "looks heavily modified", which possibly factors to the unique models.</li><li> After an NPC stole Lan's battle chips during his first trip to Netopia in 2, another similar looking NPC notes how Lan stares at him angrily and said Lan shouldn't be blaming others just because they look alike.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a>: Zig-zagged - there's clearly "futuristic" technology that still doesn't look too out of place ten plus years later (Flat-screen television monitors, for example), but a clever eye can spot some outdated tech such as CRT monitors, which were much more common in the early 00s when the games were first created but are uncommon in the new tens. The games also show technology marching on in-universe as well - early on, a Navi user must physically insert the device into the jack-in port, the second game uses a wireless adapter as a plot point, and in the future games they can do so wirelessly - somewhat reflecting how technology with game boy connectivity (and other devices as well) marched on.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Actually justified</a> on two levels - you can conveniently jack into some of these devices implying that they were of recent creation (They were likely designed to look retro) <em>and</em> the game was set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> at best.</li><li> The designs for the PET's have not aged well, and by the end of the 2010's, appear horribly out of date. The Original PET resembles a netbook, complete with keyboard, a concept killed off by tablets. The Advanced PET resembles a flip phone, a cell phone designed abandoned long ago and now associated with the elderly. The Progress PET and Link PET_EX resemble classic iPods and mini iPods, respectively, both designs, and MP3 players as a concept, killed off by smart phones. The Plug-in PET from the third game, and also the second PET introduced, has actually aged better than the rest. In terms of appearance, it more or less resembles a modern tablet. However, it still uses a wired connection to jack-in and requires the use of physical buttons to operate rather than a touch screen.</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoMan">Video Man</a>'s design references VHS tapes and RCA connectors. VHS has since been replaced by DVD as the standard video recording medium, and RCA has been replaced by HDMI as the standard A/V connection. Justified as Viddy's stated goal for the tournament prize money (to change him from analog to digital) implies that <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoMan">Video Man</a> is an outdated model of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetNavi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetNavi">Net Navi</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
