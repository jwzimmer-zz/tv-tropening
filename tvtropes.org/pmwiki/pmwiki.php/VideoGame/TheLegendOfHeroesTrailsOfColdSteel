There, he faces not only exams and field work, but also a student body fractured along lines of social class, a willful teacher with an unorthodox approach to education, and his own insecurities. And in the background, even as Erebonia begins to expand its reach across the continent of Zemuria, its class conflicts begin to slip into open war.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In the last two games, set a year later, the original Class VII has since graduated and moved on with their lives, with Rean taking up a position as teacher for a new Class VII at the Thors Second Branch School at the town of Leeves. Even as they take up missions on behalf of Erebonia, they and their teacher will also have to deal with their personal demons even as they begin to pry deeper into Erebonia's terrible secrets, some of which lead back to Chancellor Giliath Osborne, the architect of the Empire's expansionism. And it will take the combined efforts of Rean, his former classmates, his students, and other friends&mdash;as well as a few familiar faces&mdash;to stop Osborne's ambitions, even as they discover that not everything is what it seems.</p><p>There are also two audio dramas associated with the series, each attached with the first two games. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.trailsofcoldsteel.com/cs2/memoirs1.html">Transcriptions<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of both can now be found at the official website for the second game.</p><p>The first two games have been localized worldwide by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSEEDGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSEEDGames">XSEED Games</a>, and the latter two by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NISAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NISAmerica">NIS America</a>.</p><p>The tetralogy is immediately followed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfOrigins">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Origins</a></em>, released in August 2020 and which includes both Erebonia and Crossbell, as well as other new locations.</p><p><strong>As the third arc in a series with a continuous narrative, expect spoilers for previous games.</strong> <br><strong>Please keep in mind also that this and associated subpages contain details for the original game, <em>Trails of Cold Steel II</em>, <em>Trails of Cold Steel III</em> and <em>Trails of Cold Steel IV -The End of SAGA-</em>.</strong></p><hr><h2> This game provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A - D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap">Absurdly High Level Cap</a>: In the original <em>Cold Steel</em>, as well as <em>Cold Steel III</em>, level 99 is the maximum level for any character. Level 68 is generally the recommended level for fighting the final boss in <em>Cold Steel I</em>, and that's on Nightmare Mode. The are no optional bosses and therefore no practical need for anything close to level 99. Reaching Level 80 or higher with Rean in <em>Cold Steel I</em> will grant you some bonus items in <em>Cold Steel II</em>, but that's it. This also applies when loading <em>Cold Steel III</em> clear data with a level 65-75 Rean when starting <em>Cold Steel IV</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Furthermore, gained EXP is relative to your current level, so after a point, even fighting the toughest enemies will grant only a negligible amount of EXP</a>. You can even things a bit by taking advantage of easy multipliers, but it's still a grind. The maximum level in <em>Cold Steel II</em> and <em>Cold Steel IV</em> is 200. While you'll probably get well into the 150s if you play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and maybe the 160s, there's not much point in going higher than that.

Especially seen with Sara, who despite being a drunk who likes to mooch off others and shove her workload onto Rean, is incredibly strong and is considered one of the top fighters of the series. Aside from Instructor Mary and the Vice-Principal Heinrich, the rest of the teaching staff at Thors are no slouches themselves either as seen during the finale of the first game where they all take on a squadron of Panzer Soldats on foot without hesitation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Mary graduates from this in <em>Cold Steel IV</em> where she ends up fighting against Rean, and joins in the Crossbell concert to help distract the guards while Rean and his group climbs up the Orchis Tower.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: In a setting like Kiseki, this was bound to happen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead">Affectionate Gesture to the Head</a>: Sara likes doing this to Fie, who puts up with it but tells Sara how annoying she finds it. Laura's father also does this to her when they see each other again for the first time in months. Laura is more embarrassed that the gesture is seen by her classmates than by the gesture itself. Rean also has a tendency to do it to any girl he's close to (Alisa, Towa, and Elise are all on the receiving end, much to their collective frustration). In <em>Cold Steel III</em>, if you get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fie's bonding event, she specifically requests this of Rean, "So I can keep doing my best on this path."

It's especially reinforced by his classmates, comrades and, later, his students, who try their best to make Rean recognize that he needs their support. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The normal ending of <em>Cold Steel IV</em> happened because Rean still decided to take on everything alone, instead of getting the help of the Holy Beast and the other characters. The same goes for all the times of him trying to sacrifice himself for someone - those were times when he refused to burden someone else, thus doing everything alone. The scenes of the game, such as the confrontation with Rufus and a cursed Alan only reinforce this.

Also, unlike many games, you can save at anytime you're not in battle or viewing a cutscene. The game also provides you with plenty of access to stuff like maps and help.</li><li> If you get knocked out during a boss battle, the game offers the option to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode">weaken</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode">the boss</a> and retry in addition to just retrying.

At the end of the event you gain additional bonding level and if you've reached the max or were at it already, then you get the special event and the trophy. Afterwards, either way, you can move on to another event without having to reload until you've spent all the tickets, or, past a certain point, you have the option to manually forfeit the rest of your tickets if you decide you don't need them.</li><li> In <em>Cold Steel IV</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> requires you to beat the game once, then reload a save file to just before the final dungeon in order to unlock a hidden sidequest.

This is used to provide an in-universe explanation for why Rean can't use Valimar in the first half of <em>Cold Steel II</em> outside of a handful of boss battles - Valimar's recovering from the last Spirit Path usage. The second half of the game grants the team an alternative form of long-range transportation in the form of the Courageous, and as such Valimar is on call more often.</li><li> The Lost Arts are incredibly powerful (And give a 10% experience bonus for every use), but the extremely slow cast time and high EP cost (100% of the caster's max EP, whatever that may be) make them highly impractical outside of boss fights unless you either use Overdrive (instantaneous casting), a Master Quartz that returns a percentage of damage as EP (the offensive Lost Arts do so much damage that it essentially makes the casting free), or a 0 EP random turn bonus (instantaneous casting <em>and</em> no EP cost).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMusicOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMusicOverride">Background Music Override</a>:<ul><li> A portion of "Atrocious Raid" plays almost continuously throughout the sequence in Garrelia Fortress in Chapter 5 and doesn't stop until the final boss battle, save if you use one of the orbment charging stations to heal your party, and briefly before the first firing of the railway guns, which reveals that they start off with blanks.</li><li> In the final dungeon of the first game, the usual enemy battle music is forgone and, instead, "To Grasp Tomorrow" - the dungeon's BGM - continues to play straight up to the dungeon's end.</li><li> "Blitzkrieg" and "To Gamble All or Nothing", like "Atrocious Raid", play continuously throughout their dungeons.</li><li> For <em>Cold Steel IV</em>, "Doomsday Trance" plays continuously at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Black Workshop where the three teams have to meet up.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a>: Class VII in general.

Justified, as between games he ended up fleeing a losing battle and spent a month recovering from severe injuries taken during said battle. This, however, doesn't quite explain why the other characters join the party at about the same level as whatever Rean has at the time, even though they clearly haven't been idling. It also feels very odd that accomplished fighters such as Toval, Sara, etc., would be carrying around the same basic levels as your party. On the flipside, everybody retains their crafts from the original game, including S-Crafts, and they swiftly start gaining new abilities as well. Laura and Emma have even managed to gain new abilities prior to meeting back up the group.</li><li> In the second game, Valimar can no longer use Spirit without a subcontractor or use Qinggong to buff himself.</li><li> In the third game, Rean is leading a new team and is using an improved version of the ARCUS called ARCUS II and thus is incompatible with the old orbments that he has. However, Rean relearns Gale very quickly suggesting that he could always use his old crafts but just holds back enough for his students till they get better. Meanwhile for old Class VII, some of them still use their old crafts and improve upon them while also using different S-Crafts, suggesting that they trained really hard that they feel that their old crafts aren't worth using anymore, although their levels all drop to be comparable with the new Class VII's at the time of joining up.</li><li> By the fourth game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Juna, Kurt, and Altina lose a lot of levels at the start of the game due to them sleeping for two whole weeks (it's implied that old Class VII also lost some levels but they were able to wake up a week earlier and were able to get their old strength back). Juna, Kurt, and Altina also lose their quartz and equipment while escaping the Gral of Erebos plus the ARCUS II units were improved in the meantime so even if they had their old quartz and master quartz, it would have been incompatible anyway. After a week of training however, they mostly get their old strength back. Meanwhile, Ash was in a coma for two weeks while Musse was able to escape the Gral and thus is actually stronger when she comes back to the party. Interestingly enough, Rean's ARCUS II equipment is upgraded despite being captured for a month's time in-game in chains and actually has the highest level when he first becomes playable at the Black Workshop at level 90 compared to everyone else who are hovering between 82-87.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>: Laura and Fie become this after sorting through their differences.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Battle Aura</a>: One way to tell when someone's getting serious is if they put up a visible aura of power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>: Celestin, Patrick's servant, fights with martial arts.

However, while the Reformists seem to be the better bunch on the surface - particularly given how dedicated they are to equality for all (and the fact that they oppose the Noble Alliance's depredations) - they have plenty of skeletons in their own closet, especially given Chancellor Osborne's tendency to annex neighboring territories by force and intimidation, including Crossbell, Jurai, and a botched attempt to do the same to Liberl as well as his motivations to expand and centralize authority with little heed paid to those who are harmed by such actions. Additionally, the Noble faction actually shares the Reformist's imperialistic tendencies, since they started the 100 Days War and would have tried to annex Crossbell if they had won the civil war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket">Black Market</a>: The Erebonian Empire has a relationship with its foreign neighbors, particularly Calvard, that can be described as... complex, at best.

Toval then calls Rean to explore the shrine that houses Algres' spirit except players are allowed to explore the shrine, get some Active Voice Events and obtain the treasure chests in the area. If players don't unlock the place and finish the game, then players have to backtrack to the entrance of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann to start the quest and immediately fight the boss without exploring the place.

It's also only possible to earn the necessary Rank <em>after the final dungeon</em> so it's generally only useful if you plan to play New Game Plus with item carryover but not level carryover.

As with Crossbell, it's not <em>quite</em> as bad as it was made out to be (in both cases, our prior exposure has been through parties with reasons to accentuate the negative) but it's definitely one of the most troubled realms on the continent. For example:<ul><li> The country still possesses a feudal power structure which is only slowly granting more power to the Commoners... and the person behind those changes is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Osborne</a>. And by "still", we mean that it's pretty clear that Erebonia is the only true autocratic monarchy left on Zemuria, with it being ringed by states that are more or less democratic, and all of them, including fellow major power Calvard, distrust Erebonia due to its autocratic nature.</li><li> Relatedly, tensions between the social classes have been simmering for years, decades really, and are just waiting for a spark to turn things into a very nasty civil war.</li><li> Lingering disputes with Calvard over the disposition of Crossbell, resentment from recently annexed territories (and relatedly, the underlying sting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">having been humiliated on the field of battle by tiny, independent Liberl</a>) and a new terrorist movement are only making things worse.</li><li> To cap things off, Ouroboros isn't just working behind the scenes, they're supporting <em>both sides</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello">Crash-Into Hello</a>: Alisa and Rean meet in the first game when Rean pauses in the middle of the street to take in the sights of Trista and Alisa walks into him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits">Creative Closing Credits</a>: The closing credits of <em>Cold Steel II</em> present a series of photographs giving hints into what the members of Class VII and certain other key characters are up to following the events of the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>:<ul><li> The fights against Sara and Victor will end with your character(s) defeated, at best you might annoy them slightly. Of course, one is your combat instructor (Who according to the Battle Notes is level 49 at a time when the party is roughly level 15) and the other is the best swordsman in the Empire (Level 80 when the party is roughly level 50) so the result was something of a foregone conclusion. The fight against &lt;C&gt; (Level 60 when the party is roughly level 40) in Heimdallr's catacombs will end after a few turns, though if it continued it would have become this.</li><li> Turned around at Legram when you have a match against the students, who don't even get the dignity of an actual battle before they're shown to be defeated by Class VII. Then Class VII has to fight their teacher, who puts up an actual fight.</li><li> The Panzer Soldats utterly and completely wreck the First Armored Division (the Imperial Guards no less), destroying even the most advanced of tanks with a single blow each.</li><li> Crow inflicts one of these on Rean while both are operating their respective Divine Knights, with Crow pointing out that he's had three years to learn how to pilot his machine while Rean has only had a few minutes.</li><li> If you carry over your levels and equipment on New Game Plus, you can easily devastate Sara, even in Nightmare mode, by flashing her with Rean, Machias and Jusis's S-Breaks before she can even get a turn. So the game cheats by making it so that you can only reduce her HP to 1 and then she flashes your party with own S-Break for 49,999 damage each to annihilate them. If any of them had any sort of guard status up to protect against it, she'll just do it again.</li><li> Similarly, you can have Rean hold his own against Victor for a while if you keep healing, but eventually he will hit him for 49,999 damage and it's over.</li><li> At the end of the first Act of <em>Cold Steel II</em>, all of the most major players of allied forces of the Noble Alliance descend upon Ymir. Obviously things do not go well for our intrepid heroes. It ends with Rean agreeing to come the Noble Alliance's flagship airship for a meeting with the Noble Alliance's leader, Duke Cayenne.</li><li> In the epilogue of <em>Cold Steel II</em>, the boys and girls compete in five swimming matches, but Laura and Fie are always sent out for the last four matches, resulting in the girls winning easily. Though the competition becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion">Curb Stomp Cushion</a> if Rean manages to win the first match.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Curse</a>: In <em>Cold Steel III</em>, this is the reason why so many terrible things have happened throughout Erebonia as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Joshua's, Loewe's, Claire's, Lechter's, Olivier/Olivert's, Rean's, Osborne's and Ash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark And Troubled Pasts</a> have shown.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseCutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseCutShort">Curse Cut Short</a>: Rean's response to Rex's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBehindYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBehindYou">Look Behind You</a> trick, when he catches himself and stops short of the final word.<div class="indent"> <strong>Rean: </strong> Sonofa...</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform">Custom Uniform</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform">Non-Uniform Uniform</a>: Sort of. As noted, Class VII gets red uniforms that set them apart from the other students... except that these are basically just red-colored jackets or vests, and the actual design is pretty much the same as the standard Thors uniform. Everyone's outfit from the waist down is unique - while the girls all wear pleated skirts and the boys dark slacks, the color pattern on the skirts varies, as does the styling on the trousers. Footgear tends to be distinct from student to student as well.<ul><li> Angelica also has a "custom uniform" in the sense that she doesn't actually bother <em>wearing</em> her Thors attire, instead going around in her biking suit. Nobody really complains because she's the daughter of one of the most powerful families in Erebonia.</li><li> George is another person who never wears his uniform, instead wearing a yellow jumpsuit that is far more practical when tinkering with orbal equipment. Since he appears to be the only orbal repairman in all of Trista, this may be justified. Similarly, in <em>III</em>, Tita always wears her work outfit rather than her school uniform.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>: Jusis Albarea is first seen fighting in the Old Schoolhouse casually striking down a half dozen monsters with a single swipe each. Outside of New Game Plus, in actual battle Jusis would not be able to take out those same monsters with standard attacks, and one in particular is very resistant to physical attacks in general and would take at least a dozen hits or arts to bring down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>: The battle interface in <em>Cold Steel III</em> is totally different from the one used in every preceding game, in this arc and before, with every button being a distinct command rather than rotating through a wheel to find the command desired. In normal turn base mode this doesn't matter much, but the fact that the S-Break command (which is semi-real time) has been moved from the triangle button (which is now "Use Crafts when it is your turn") to the RB button (which used to be "Swap out party members when it is your turn") is likely to cause a few slip-ups.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>: <em>Cold Steel III</em> is this compared to most of the previous series. While they had some dark moments as well, the mood is usually upbeat compared to <em>Cold Steel III</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and its depressing ending. And <em>Cold Steel IV</em> is much darker.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a>: There are usually one of these moments per game.<ul><li> The first one ends with the assassination of Giliath Osborne by the terrorist C, who happens to be Crow, one of Class VII's members. The Noble Alliance take the opportunity by not only reveal their flagship, the Pantagruel, but also reveal their own mechs, the Panzer Soldats, who make mincemeat of the Imperial Army's tanks. When Trista is attacked by a few of these mechs, Class VII is only saved by Rean forging a contract with the Ashen Knight. Despite this, Crow shows up and reveal he has his own Divine Knight and casually slaps aside Rean who is only saved by his friends intervention while he is forced to leave them to theirs fates.</li><li> The third game ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the emperor being shot by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">curse-manipulated</a> Ash who is framed by the government as a Calvardian spy. Afterwards, as Rean and both Class VII try to prevent Osborne and Ouroboros from unleashing the curse upon the land, the Courageous is blowed with Olivert, Victor and Toval still inside and Millium dies saving Rean from the corrupted holy beast holding the curse. Rean subsequent grief lead to him losing control of his ogre powers and slaying the beast unleashing the curse upon Erebonia and leaving its citizens craving for Calvard's destruction.</span></li><li> Finally during the Act 2 of the last game,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Pantagruel is ambushed by the Glorious and various members of Jormungand during negotiations about the Mille Mirage. As Ouroboros brings its 3 Aions alongside Zector and Testa-Rossa, the situation is dire enough for Musse and Aurelia to initiate their final plan which is to allow the most of people to escape, entrust the movement to Cassius and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">ram the Pantagruel into the Glorious</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">destroying them both.</a> They are thankfully prevented from doing this by the Courageous II's intervention led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Olivert</a>.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarthVaderClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarthVaderClone">Darth Vader Clone</a>: &lt;C&gt;, the leader of the Imperial Liberation Front.

Amongst their number are Rean, who suffers from a lack of self-confidence, has a lot of issues regarding the fact that he's adopted, and he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> that he cannot fully control; Alisa, the heiress to the Reinford family whose family broke up after the untimely death of her father and who is trying fruitlessly to distance herself from her workaholic mother; Machias, the son of the Imperial governor whose bitter hatred of nobles came from the fact that some of them drove his cousin - an older sister figure to him - to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicide</a> over her relationship with one of their own; Emma, a Hexen clan witch whose job is to guide Rean from behind the scenes and who has to hide her true nature (at least initially) from her friends; Jusis, bastard son of one of the Four Great Houses, who is basically neglected and scorned by his father; and Fie, an ex-Jaeger whose earliest memories are wandering a battlefield alone and whose surrogate family effectively disbanded after the death of their leader. And that's not even touching on Crow and the baggage he eventually brings to the table.<ul><li> The remaining three get off fairly lightly. Elliot has a dispute going on with his father over his future career (Elliot wants to be a musician like his mother, while his father the general wants his only son to follow in his footsteps), while Laura and Gaius have no major hangups.</li><li> The new Class VII also have their issues. Juna is from a recently annexed province and hates the Empire for stealing her homeland's autonomy. Kurt was raised with the expectation that he'd be serving as a royal bodyguard when he grew up just like every other Vander for the past 250+ years, only to have his family duty be suddenly taken away for reasons of politics, leaving him without a purpose. Altina has no real knowledge of emotions or what to do with herself outside of mission objectives. Ash is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a survivor of Hamel</span>.

In addition, Erebonia makes peace with both Liberl and Crossbell, as shown with most of the heroes from all three nations attending the wedding of Olivert and Scherazard, a symbolic step towards bridging Erebonia's class divides. Of course, there are still a few loose ends, such as Prince Cedric, deeming himself beyond redemption for having supported Osborne, choosing to join Ouroboros at Shirley's suggestion, McBurn hinting he has some unfinished business to take care of, and Erebonia's relations with the Calvard Republic remaining a little shaky (thus setting the scene for the next story arc in the franchise), as well as the first onscreen appearance of the Grandmaster of Ouroboros, who states that despite failing to physically obtain the Sept-Terrions of Mirage, Fire and Earth, they have still managed to accomplish enough of their (unspecified) goals to proceed with the next phase of the Phantasmal Blaze Plan, but as far as Class VII is concerned, such loose ends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">would have to wait for another day</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUniversityHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUniversityHigh">Elaborate University High</a>: Thors Military Academy.

By Chapter 3, the train is now filled with everyone from Class VII until Chapter 5 where Crow and Millium join up and thus are added as well. In chapter 4, they all take their class jackets off because it's summer, which they put back on when summer is over in chapter 6. If you save the game and then reload in the brief period of time in the final chapter between clearing the old schoolhouse and performing the concert, the party will be shown wearing their concert outfits. The view through the windows of the train is the location that Rean's team is currently exploring in the current chapter's field exam. After Crow betrays the party near the end of the game, he disappears from the train.</li><li> This returns for <em>Cold Steel II</em> with Rean first alone in a snowy field, then with classmates/supporting adults on a balcony and Ymir, then eventually the wide group of classmates and supporters gathered in and around the footbath in Ymir. Later, when Rean is forced aboard the Alliance's flagship airship, the scene depicts Valimar and Ordine on the airship's deck. After that, the opener shifts to the party on the deck of the Courageous. From there, the view of the clouds from the deck varies depending on the time of the day of the story, generally either a blue sky or sunset clouds. During the segment after the party retakes Trista, however, it's a night sky. Then, following that, it's snowing. And when the party enters the final dungeon, Valimar is shown stationed outside it. Then, when you begin the Divertissement section, it shows Lloyd and Rixia from the center down standing outside a certain gate. Finally, following this segment, Class VII is gathered atop the rooftop of Thors on a sunny day. Finishing the game updates this version where everyone is viewed from the front instead of from behind. In it, Crow's silhouette is also featured briefly before fading.</li><li> This is played with in <em>Cold Steel III</em> with the images replaced with stills of various party members who happen to be relevant to the current part of the story being played through but played straight again in <em>Cold Steel IV</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the game is first booted up, it features Rean all chained up with his eyes closed. When the game stars Juna in Act 1, it features Juna, Kurt, and Altina, and then Ash and finally Musse join in. During the Fragment Intermission, it features Rean's image all chained up again but this time his eyes are open and the image is zoomed in. After which, it then features old Class VII starting with Rean with Valimar and Crow with Ordine. During the Pantagruel sequence, it changes to Estelle, Lloyd, and Rean with their S-Craft portraits. In the Finale, it has all of new Class VII and Crow on the right side while all of old Class VII are on the left side with Rean in the middle, drawing his tachi. If players get the Golden Ending, the music changes to a happier melody and a photo image of the final image of the game.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>: When blatantly noble-hating Machias asks his classmates what their social rank is, Rean says that "there isn't a drop of noble blood in my veins". This is technically true, but glosses over the fact that while Rean is common-born, he's also the adopted son of a Baron, making him low-end nobility despite his lack of pedigree. Also, once Machias learns the full truth, he treats it essentially as if Rean had flat-out lied.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller">Expecting Someone Taller</a>: In <em>Cold Steel III</em>, after Rean plays his first opponent at Vantage Masters, a young boy named Zach, he recognizes him as the Ashen Chevalier.

Laura and Emma are at least wearing open coats that go down to mid-calf over their skirts, but none of the others have anything below the bottom of their skirts/shorts other than their footgear. Fie is the worst example, wearing an open jacket, a midriff-baring top, and low-hanging short shorts. Rean and Gaius actually have a conversation about it if you view one of their bonding events.

In the first Chapter of the third game, the Imperial Army is tied down and all but forbidden to take action in the Sutherland province(which happens to hold one of the largest Imperial Army bases) despite there being several aggressive monsters, rogue Archaisms, and active members of Ouroboros running rampant in the area, leaving the understaffed Provincial Army to handle it. Rean surmises that this is so the Provincial Army can try their hand and fail, allowing Osborne to further discredit the Provincial Armies and nobility while keeping his own hands clean.<ul><li> The same thing occurs in Ordis mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a> when the Railway Guns are stolen and open fire on the city: If the nobles fail, they lose some of their already dwindling power and one of their major powerbases.

Fittingly, when she joins the party at Garrelia Fortress she's <em>exactly</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a> as you'd expect. This also applies to Sharon in the second game. Being an Enforcer of Ouroboros, her crafts are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a> and she's considered the best of three temporary party members (the other two are Toval and Claire).</li><li> At one point, Machias and Jusis', and later Laura and Fie's, inability to get along leads to the Tactical Link system <em>breaking</em>. Rean and Alisa's dispute doesn't break the Link system because they get over their issues before they end up in the same party. Jusis and Millium's link also doesn't break (despite Jusis' apparent distrust over her) partly because Millium doesn't seem to be aware of the fact, as opposed to what happened with Jusis-Machias and Fie-Laura and Millium joins after Jusis had his major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> months prior.</li><li> In <em>Cold Steel III</em>, veterans like Rean, Aurelia, Claire, and the old Class VII have an EXP bonus that the New Class VII don't, allowing them to gain more EXP at the same level and to stay ahead of the newbies. This is zigzagged, since some characters such as Agate and Altina don't have this bonus, despite being more battle-hardened than the new students.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>:<ul><li> The story makes a huge deal about how important and battle-changing combat links are but they hardly even make a difference during actual gameplay battles, especially during early and mid game. Though this is actually a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that the true power of the ARCUS only comes to the fore when they are <em>all</em> able to work in sync. You see a flash of it at the beginning of the game with the first boss, but it doesn't really come into play until you get Burst, which allows everyone to rush all opponents on the field in succession. As Rean sometimes says after winning a battle with it...</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Rean</strong>: This is our <em>real</em> power!</div><ul><li> The story also makes a big deal about how much more powerful Laura and Fie are compare the rest but in gameplay, (barring overpowered skills like Rean's Arc Slash) they aren't too different from any of the other physical-based characters. To ameliorate this, Laura and Fie have their S-Craft without advancing the storyline.<ul><li> Another problem then comes during the battle where you play as Fie and Laura vs Rean and Machias, which is arguably one of the hardest, if not the hardest, battle in the game, especially on the higher difficulties. This can also be justified since both the fight comes after Fie and Laura finished their duel, but to add insult to injury, when the battle ends Machias and Rean are on their knees, and the girls don't even appear to be winded.</li></ul></li><li> In New Game Plus, if you carry your levels and equipment, you can easily one-shot most regular enemies throughout a good portion of the game and get out of most boss battles with barely a scratch, even on Nightmare Mode. The characters, however, will still act in the cutscenes as if they had engaged in battles which had pushed them to their limits. Also, if you do enough damage to take down an enemy in any battle where some sort of "event" has to occur, such as the combat link between Jusis/Machias or Laura/Fie breaking, then the game will only allow the enemy's HP to go down to 1 and you can't actually land the killing blow until after the event occurs.</li><li> NPCs will always react to your field character is if it was Rean, and your field character's reactions are clearly meant to reflect Rean's. This is mostly notable when talking to Dorothee, where your field character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sweatdrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sweatdrop">Sweatdrops</a> at her Yaoi obsession, even if it's Alfin, who is a fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirl</a> herself.</li><li> Characters in field studies often recognize that Class VII is from Thors Academy from their uniforms - even if the entire party is equipped with DLC or New Game + skins that bear no resemblance to the school uniforms (pajamas and bathing suits, for example). Another example would be accessories, i.e. in <em>Cold Steel III</em>, a kid named Ken comments regarding Machias "Who's this weird, old glasses guy?" even if you equipped him with the contact lenses accessory and he therefore isn't wearing glasses, or Juna lamenting that she's at the beach while having forgotten to pack a bathing suit - while wearing a swimsuit skin.</li><li> In New Game Plus, you can carry your link EXP for free, meaning that across multiple playthroughs (or even possibly your second playthrough if you really play a <em>lot</em>) you could have link level 5 between Jusis and Machias / Laura and Fie. Doesn't matter - Jusis and Machias will still behave early-on as if they can't stand the sight of each other and Laura and Fie will still have their tiffs. And their links will still break in the respective storyline battles, even if said link carries the power of link level 5. It's actually impossible to win those fights until after those links break, even though it's possible to get the boss to drop to 0 HP in one turn.</li><li> In <em>Cold Steel III</em>, one of the bonding events involves helping Altina to choose a school club for the Thors Branch Campus. If you do the event, then ultimately he is with her as she joins the Swimming Club. That evening, however, when he speaks with her in the town cafe, even if you did the event he will comment "Oh, I heard you picked a club. So you're in the Swimming Club with Leonora, huh," as if this information had come to him secondhand.</li><li> In <em>Cold Steel III</em>, a big issue in the early part of the game is that Rean is no longer able to freely use his Spirit Unification <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> ("ogre power") due to it having gone out of control before during the war in North Ambria. In a New Game Plus, you have free access to it in battle, but for story purposes the other characters will still act as if he isn't using it.</li><li> During the Vantage Masters match against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rutger</span> in <em>III</em>, it's stated that the premade deck the player can use is a copy of his. However, his actual Master Card is Beast, which the player doesn't get even if they get pick the premade deck. Additionally, he has at least two copies of Geune-Foss, despite the starting screen showing the player has only one, meaning even his non-master loadout is different. Finally, the post-match cutscene shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rutger</span> had cards that weren't in the premade deck, such as the Vanish card and two copies of a 5 ATK Heaven natial.</li><li> The anti-frustration feature about cooking in III means that members of the Old Class VII can cook for Rean when they're not even in the same part of the country as him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOut">Get Out!</a>: The girls dismiss Crow's idea of having them in bikinis for the School Festival with that statement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship">Global Airship</a>: The party ends up having access to the Courageous in <em>Cold Steel II</em> at the start of Act II.

Both have around 90,000 HP and Fie says before the battle that the party has about a "20% chance" of victory. You're allowed to whittle around a quarter of that before both use their S-Crafts. The battle ends automatically a few turns later and it's revealed that they were holding back. Later on, a fight against Jusis' brother Rufus is so hopeless that on the first playthrough the only way to survive the first art is to use a Master Quartz with auto-reflect or auto-revive capabilities.

This is important because there are three unofficial sidequests connected with cooking: Instructor Thomas and one of the upper-class dorm maids are looking for unique dishes (the maid the highest quality examples and Thomas the lowest quality ones), and will pay in items for every five examples provided, and in the last chapter, Margarita (herself an oblivious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a>) will provide a Master or Rare (if the Master Quartz was received in a previous playthrough) Quartz if you can present her with a notebook that shows all eighty (Twenty recipes times four levels of quality) dishes in it.

After a brief battle, Angelica wins and Marquis Rogner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">takes his loss surprisingly well</a> and agrees to pull the Nortia Provincial Army out of the war.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain">Let Us Never Speak of This Again</a>: In the English dub, Machias will say this word-for-word if you choose him as a partner for cooking and the result is a peculiar dish.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">Limited Wardrobe</a>: The first game in the series to completely justify this is also the one to avert it. The members of Class VII obviously wear the same outfit because it's the uniform of Thors Military Academy. The leap to 3D also allowed Falcom to make alternate costumes so everyone has a few opportunities to change their clothes, more so with DLC casual clothing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> bonuses.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleHeroBigWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleHeroBigWar">Little Hero, Big War</a>: While Class VII's actions are critical to every campaign they participate in in the war, it's made quite clear that the Imperial Army is doing the lion's share of the fighting. In many cases, the only reason Class VII is free to act is because the Army is pinning down the bulk of the rebel forces somewhere else.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWithTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWithTheVillain">Living with the Villain</a>: Surprisingly common in Cold Steel:<ul><li> The super-maid Sharon is actually an Ouroboros Enforcer, which theoretically places her in conflict with many of Class VII's allies, like Sara and the Intelligence Division, although this is ultimately a subversion as no conflict ever arises from it.

Ten out of those eleven are playable in <em>Cold Steel II</em> and the game piles on a bevy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> characters such that your playable team is larger than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, assuming you don't count that game's briefly playable moogles. At the end of the second game, there are <em>18</em> playable characters, with the number increasing to <em>23</em> if you count the Phantasmal Mirror items that let you transform your characters into other characters. <em>Cold Steel III</em> then shakes things up by giving you alternating segments where Rean is accompanied by members of the new Class VII and members of the old Class VII while giving out loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest Star Party Members</a> that accompany you periodically. Despite not having that specific amount when entering the final dungeon, the player would have cycled through no less than <em>26</em> characters.</li><li> The roster of characters returning from previous games for <em>Cold Steel IV</em> specifically also deserves mention. To list them off, we have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Estelle, Joshua, Renne, Josette, Tita, Agate, Scherazard, Kloe, and <em>Cassius</em> representing the <em>Sky</em> trilogy and Lloyd, Elie, Tio, Randy, and KeA representing the <em>Zero/Ao</em> duology. That's six out of the original eight playable characters from the first <em>Trails</em> game plus some extra allies representing the Liberl games and all of the founding members of the Special Support Section representing the Crossbell games.</span> Even without adding them to the likes of the old and new Class VII, that's an impressive roster.</li><li> By the final parts of the <em>Cold Steel IV</em>, players would have cycled through <em><strong>39 playable characters</strong></em> with notable addition of<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> several former villains like the Stahlritter, Xeno, Leonidas, Vita and George, Victor, and <em>Celine in human form</em></span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBehindYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBehindYou">Look Behind You</a>:<ul><li> In one of the sidequests which has Rean trying to bust Rex for selling candid photos, he corners him at the Old Schoolhouse.

Rean turns his head a little bit, Sara just glances at the side claiming that she's not falling for that, and Angelica <em>does a full 180 turn</em> to find the woman, making Rean and Sara have a sweat drop and the informant running away.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>: Minors can't bet on horse races. But nothing's stopping certain schools hosting "sweepstakes" where students can "guess" which horse will win and receive prizes for guessing correctly.

Needless to say, Crow took part in these often.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a>: Duke Cayenne is supporting the Imperial Liberation Front.

They also have at least one agent keeping an eye on both Class VII and the Reinford Group and they're providing resources and know-how to Reinford.

After which, all 3 areas will have a boss fight at the end of their areas and when the three groups converge, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they have to fight a boss who has to be damaged in certain phases, with Rean's group being the last.

The final dungeon in comparison, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gral of Erebos, is just a short dungeon with no gimmicks but makes up for it with 3 boss gauntlets with each boss needing 3 specific party members that permanently leave the party after the boss fight is done, the final boss on foot, and two Divine Knight battles.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarshmallowHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarshmallowHell">Marshmallow Hell</a>: Poor Rean can't catch a break in the prologue. He gets a face full of Alisa's cleavage and gets slapped for it despite what happened being an accident. It takes them three weeks to properly make up.

The primary check on their power is the fact that the Sachsen Mines that provide the bulk of their raw material are owned by the royal family rather than the company or the local nobility.<ul><li> Their Fifth Division is revealed in the Final Chapter to be a supporter of the Noble Faction and its proxy the Imperial Liberation Front. By implication, it's also likely to be a satellite branch of Workshop Thirteen.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantCity">Merchant City</a>: Well, Merchant Town at any rate.

Many orbal cars and trams dot its ancient streets at a rapid pace, and because the city is still transitioning from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution">Orbal Revolution</a>, it still retains its old Medieval feel all over, creating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>. Some of Class VII's missions take them inside the capital, where there are a lot of shops to visit, locals to interact with, and monsters roaming in the catacombs below to defeat.

In fact, the final chapter reveals that a full <em>60%</em> of Thors graduates do not go into the military after graduation, and roughly a quarter of those who do seek a military career do so in the Provincial Armies rather than the Imperial Army, despite Thors being an Imperial institution. At one point in <em>III</em> it's mentioned that Osborne had just reorganized the Academy for the purpose of encouraging all students to enter some form of government service after graduating, whether it be in the military or not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a>: None of the students at Thors really carry themselves as officers in training. The fact that, on average, three-fifths of their graduates don't actually become officers might have something to do with this. By <em>Cold Steel III</em>, the only ones who are officially part of the military from Thors who show up in-game are Rean, who is already a war veteran, teaching Thors II, Millium who was already from the Intelligence Division, and Alan who joins the 4th Armored Division. Mint and Linde later on join Thors II as a mechanic and nurse respectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless">Militaries Are Useless</a>:<ul><li> The Provincial Armies believe that their job is to help maintain their overlord's privileges rather than to help fulfill said overlord's responsibilities. As such, they see patrolling to clear monsters from the highways (Which is one of the few reasons why the Great Houses should need private military forces in areas which are in no danger of invasion) as busywork which they pass off to Class VII when they can, and ignore otherwise. The few times they bother to actually do anything, they deliberately make matters worse.</li><li> In the opening battle of the ILF's major offensive at the end of the first game, the defenders of Trista (Consisting of six teachers, ten students, and a maid) had a better showing for themselves than <em>the entire 1st Armored Division of the Imperial Army</em>.</li><li> Averted in the second game.

Even moreso if players bought the DLC attachments where players can wear, for example, a VR headset, a sign that says "Haha", and an Osborne plushie on the left arm of the character.

This is deliberate since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">lyrics also don't match the tone either</a> but are very appropriate to the situation and Falcom does all its music in-house so the song was 'made to order'.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Spell My Name with an "S"</a>: As always.<ul><li> Rean can cause a little trouble; it can be tempting to read his name as "Re-ahn", but the actual kana pronunciation is more like "Riin"; it rhymes with "lean", basically. It's clear what Falcom was going for, but the unconventional nature of the name catches some people.</li><li> Fie runs into the problem more seriously; looking at the given English spelling, you might think it's pronounced as in "oh, fie!" (rhyming with "pie") or, if you know a little kana, you might go "aha, it's pronounced 'Fi-eh', isn't it"? Nope and nope; the actual pronunciation is closest to "Fee", as in the sort you pay. This one actually does lead to debate as to how to best spell it, since going with "Fie" leads to new or casual fans consistently mispronouncing her name.</li><li> Place names don't escape, either; after five solid games of consistent spelling as "Erebonia" and "Zemuria" (when they do come up in English characters in the Japanese versions), all of a sudden <em>Cold Steel</em> is very insistent about calling the two <em>E<strong>l</strong>ebonia</em> and <em>Zemlya</em>, respectively. This one is likely to be ignored by any future Trails releases in English, as the place names were already established as the former in <em>Sky FC</em>'s English release.<ul><li> "Erebonia" was actually later <em>corrected</em> on <em>Cold Steel</em>'s promotional webpage... except the page URLs <em>still</em> have the "Elebonia" spelling. "Zemlya" persists throughout.</li><li> What's even worse is that <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novaya_Zemlya">it's not impossible that Zemlya was always the intended spelling<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but between a <em>decade</em> of "Zemuria" being previously used and Zemuria appearing prominently as a word in one official English release, it's likely the term won't be "corrected".</li></ul></li><li> There's also a little debate as to whether the capital of Erebonia is Heimdall or Heimdall<strong>r</strong>, even in official sources. This gets bonus points for the fun of trying to stack three l/r sounds together in Japanese (which the kana doesn't even remotely do, leading to the debate).</li><li> A particularly funny one involved one of the organizations in the game, as its official badge graphic read "Train Milita<strong>l</strong>y Police". <em>This</em> one was caught by even the Japanese fans the instant it went live on the website.</li><li> Another hilarious one involves the Steel Maiden's name, which was spelled as "Arianload" in Sen III website. Fans quickly noticed and it has been since then changed into its original spelling "Arianrhod."</li><li> An ice cream stand during the school festival misspells Gelato as "Jelato".</li><li> With the game remastered with higher quality visuals when released on Steam, this issue becomes much more pronounced as previously low-resolution textures are now replaced with high-resolution ones and their text are far more legible than before. A lot of these were fixed with a huge unannounced patch that was released on October 11, 2017.<ul><li> The above <em>Train Milita<strong>l</strong>y Police</em> mistake reappears in a short cutscene outside the meeting room at the start of Chapter 4's field study, as well as some less noticeable logos inside the room itself. <strong><em>J</em></strong>elato reappears too at Dreichels Plaza. Though most of the "Train Militaly" ones got fixed, a partially obscured one found on the floor of the room was missed.</li><li> In Chapter 6, one of the signposts on the highway actually spells <em>Ymir</em>, Rean's hometown, as <em>Y<strong>u</strong>mir</em>, and the same mistake appears on the map of the train lines - the line from Roer to Ymir is the Yumir branch line. In the same chapter, the signboard for <em>Roer</em> airport spells the town's name as <em>Ro<strong>u</strong>r</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14ibbu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14ibbu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14ibbu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It also states that it leads to the <em>Arr<strong>a</strong>ival</em> and Departure halls.</span></li><li> In the final chapter, the mallet used for the <em>Mishy Panic</em> minigame actually has <em>Mi<strong>c</strong>hy Panic</em> written on it. The background in the room also spells Mishy with a <em>c</em>, as does all the posters around campus. While the texture patch fixes the posters and the background of the room, strangely enough Durante missed out the logo that's part of the texture of the mallet.</li><li> And to complicate things even more, the "Ride-along Mishy" accessory is listed on the Asian Playstation Store as "HUG-HUG MICHEY"(yes, in all-caps, and one letter away from a Disney lawsuit)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Sphere of Destruction</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroNoKiseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroNoKiseki">Aion Type-Alpha</a> erases Garrelia Fortress and its Railway Cannons from existence using one of these.

If you do one of Juna's bonding events, you get to see the creature and later you a given a quest to fight the monster: Galliosaurus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">Storming the Castle</a>: In <em>Cold Steel II</em>, Class VII storms Valflame Palace, which has been transformed into the Infernal Castle, to free Cedric and face Crow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDifficultySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDifficultySetting">Story Difficulty Setting</a>: Playing the games on the easiest difficulty allows players to enjoy the story while stomping on boss fights more easily than on harder difficulties.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>: The War of the Lions was a five-way civil war that was set off when the heir apparent to the Erebonian Throne was assassinated shortly after the death of his father, resulting in all his half-siblings going to war over who had the best claim.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyVoiced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyVoiced">Suddenly Voiced</a>:<ul><li> Inverted, originally, as many characters who spoke with voiced lines in the first game (Patrick, Principal Vandyck, S and V) have their lines as unvoiced text in the second game and only speak during their battles. Played straight, however, with Lt. Generals Zechs Vander and Olaf Craig, as well as Elliot's sister Fiona who are voiced in Cold Steel 2.</li><li> The PC Steam version of the original game contains over 5,000 lines of voiced dialogue that was previously text-only, resulting in this for certain characters. Among others is a Provincial Army Officer at the end of Chapter 2 with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraveScot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraveScot">Scottish accent</a> completed with heavily rolled Rs. Olaf Craig gains some voiced dialogue in this port as well, and Patrick Hyarms is another character that seems to have a lot more voiced dialogue.

It's implied that all the Divine Knights have one of these.</li><li> As of the second game, Rean is able to properly control it after a heart-to-heart with Princess Alfin, though he learns the hard way he can only maintain it for a limited amount of time. This manifests as a brand-new craft called Spirit Unification, allowing increased stats, ailment/debuff immunity, and powered-up crafts for 3 turns.</li><li> In the beginning of <em>Cold Steel III</em>, he is no longer able to control it properly, which he tells his former classmates of Class VII happened ever since the Northern War when they ask if he's holding back. Later, Emma and Celine show up and use their magic to get it under control, allowing you to again use it at will at certain times. Then, Emma provides him a pendant which allows him to use it in moderation, even when she's not there.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a>: Estelle and Lloyd play as this to Rean in <em>Cold Steel IV</em>, doing their own thing off-screen while Rean deals with the on-screen threats.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat">Sure, Let's Go with That</a>:<ul><li> In Chapter 2, Emma uses her special brand of magic to heal a wound Rean got while jumping in to protect Jusis and Machias from a monster they thought they had all taken down. Later, Rean comments on how amazingly well his shoulder feels, asking Emma if she used some special sort of medicine. She starts to say that she didn't, then... "I-I mean, yes, I did! I used a special kind of medicine I brought with me from back home. My grandmother made it by combining a number of medicinal herbs together, I believe..."</li><li> In Chapter 6, she recognizes the barrier sealing the party inside Lohengrin Castle, saying that she's always had a sixth sense about these sorts of things. Jusis mentions that adherents of the Septian Church have often been said to have strange powers and asks if she's with the church. She at first says that it's kind of the opposite, but then backtracks and says "You've got me! I've always been a big supporter of the church."</li><li> At one point, Sara has to leave for a while to help Toval with some bracer work, leading the students of Class VII to quip about her having a hot date. When she returns, Rean discovers her muttering about all the work that Toval gave her and asks her how her "hot date" went.

Of course, most of the time this trope is played straight, with long, involved conversations happening before and after boss fights under circumstances when simply acting would have been far more sensible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksForTheMammary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksForTheMammary">Thanks for the Mammary</a>:<ul><li> When Sara drops the students into the ruins during Class VII's special orientation, Rean leaps in front of Alisa to keep her from being hurt when she lands.

It's only a 10% EXP bonus, but it can add up. Because of this, it sometimes makes sense to drag out the battle a bit to weaken the enemy enough to have a better chance of landing the overkill. Later on in the game, a great way to get overkills is to use the "Burst" link ability, which causes all of your characters to attack every target on the battlefield. What's great about it is that they will continue to strike even when the enemies are already K.O.ed, which counts as an automatic overkill. Applied correctly, you can easily land large multiple overkill bonuses, as well as other ones such as Vanquisher (40% EXP bonus for killing four or more enemies at once), Unscathed (20% bonus for taking no damage during the fight) and Swift and Sure (10% bonus for winning within three turns). The only catch is that you can only get a max of 9999 EXP per fight, though this restriction is abandoned in <em>Cold Steel II</em> and the Steam version.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed">There Is Only One Bed</a>: During the first field exam, there are plenty of beds, but they're all in one room, which makes things awkward given that the party is of mixed genders (And Alisa is still getting over the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksForTheMammary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksForTheMammary">Thanks for the Mammary</a> incident).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsACompetition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsACompetition">This Is a Competition</a>: The first game has a rare positive example. Part of Class VII's curriculum involves field studies in which the students explore separate locations in the greater world of Erebonia, split into two groups: Group A and Group B. From the beginning, Jusis Albarea (son of a high-ranking Duke) and Machias Regnitz (son of a commoner governor) are at each other's throats and during their first field study constantly dog Group B with their bickering. When the two are placed in Group A for the second field study, it looks like it's going to be more of the same. Then, on the train to the destination, Rean Schwarzer cuts through their sniping at each other, pointing out that in the previous field study, their group got an <em>E</em>, which is a low failing grade on a paper exam. He then points out that the structure of their field studies is such that it places them directly in competition with Group B and asks if they like idea of losing again. Both express surprise at the idea of him being a competitive type, but admit that he has a point and concede to at least trying to work together and seeing the other's point of view. Of course, it's not all smooth sailing, but by the end of the field study, Jusis actually joins the group in rescuing Machias, who has been illegally jailed by his father, and the two form their first successful combat link.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality">This Is Reality</a>: "Cold, cruel reality."

Whenever they fight human opponents, the most they ever do is knock them out. Even in the Panzer Soldat battles, there's only one casualty, and that was because the Soldat in question self destructed with the pilot in it rather than just stop working. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">Monsters, archaisms and animals are slaughtered wholesale, however</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>: One in <em>Cold Steel II</em> where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> ends on December 31.

Rean nevertheless manages to put up much more of a fight against him after this (in the previous battle, his attacks always did 0 damage), but still ultimately isn't able to beat him.</li><li> In <em>Cold Steel II</em>, when your party storms the Sachsen Iron Mine, the jaegers that confront them are confused by Angelica's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadHabits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadHabits">nun disguise</a> and her declaration that the mine is the property of the royal Arnor family and not that of the Rogner family. As they finally begin to figure things out, Rean declares "Too slow!" and the party comes at them. You begin the battle with Single Advantage status, meaning that all of your party members get at least one turn before they get to act.</li><li> Also in <em>Cold Steel II</em>, when you party battles Duvalie and Blueblanc in the Infernal Castle, after the battle is over, Duvalie gets a second wind, declaring "Too slow!" and barraging your party with a terrifyingly rapid-fire series of attacks that would require desperate measures to overcome if not for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">timely arrival</a> of Toval and Prince Olivert.</li><li> Additionally, "too slow" is a common comment from your characters in battle if they evade an enemy attack, allowing them to counter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">Trailers Always Spoil</a>:<ul><li> The first and probably biggest offender is the original JP trailer for the first game.

Definitely not something to watch if you have not completed the original game. Ditto with <em>Cold Steel III</em> as the <em>first few seconds</em> already spoil viewers right away.</li><li> The third game's trailer also straight-up spoils that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Osborne declares war on Calvard</span>.

You can have him agree to meet with any character with whom he has sufficient compatibility with and has shared a fateful moment with.

What does Ouroboros specifically want out of the Empire? Next game. How did Lianne Sandlot become the person we know today? Sorry, wait for the next game there too. There are also plenty of unreveals from <em>Cold Steel</em>'s plot alone. Where does Rean's power come from? No answer. Emma promises to tell everyone what she knows about, well, everything.
