They live at Boxwood Terrace in Washington, where they study human customs and Earth environments for a travel guide. They came upon Earth when they were looking for new life-friendly planets to visit and write more stories about, when they picked up a radio signal, which had a rather catchy tune. And so, the Propulsions figured that the Earthies would still be there, and have a good sense of rhythm, so they decided to move to Earth to learn more about it.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Due to being an alien, and the most interesting kid ever, Jet has become popular in the town of Boxwood Terrace and has formed a posse with the neighbor kids, appointing himself leader of the group with little complaint from the others. His friends are Sydney, who is a huge science fiction geek and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> with a great imagination and idolizes a fictional character named Commander Cressida, the 4 year old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker">Little Miss Snarker</a> Mindy, who is hilariously snarky and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstantlyCurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstantlyCurious">Constantly Curious</a>, often asking the questions that lead the episode's plots, and even though she cannot go into space with the older kids yet, she is still treated as an equal and never talked down to, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck">Nervous Wreck</a> Sean, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> who is practical, easily nervous, and dreams of leading the first human mission to Mars, but, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">gets space-sick easily, is afraid of heights, and has claustrophobia, while also having panic attacks</a>.

Unfortunately for the Propulsions, they have a difficult time keeping their alien identities secret, having almost exposed their identities several times throughout the series, though they always manage to keep it a secret anyway. The only characters who have likely chances of knowing are Dr. Rafferty (Sean's mother), a DSA scientist who was informed by Jet about his origins, but luckily dismisses it as "imagination", and the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective">Kid Detective</a> Mitchell Peterson, who can either be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">vain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">quiet and obedient</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">both</a>. He, for unknown reasons, constantly spies on Jet, and even tried to expose his secret alien identity in front of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">whole town</a>, which failed, <em>twice</em>.</p><p>At the end of each episode, scientist Amy Mainzer (also called Astronomer Amy) hosts educational interstitial segments: the segments are not included in the export version.The educational mission of the series is to build on children&#146;s curiosity about astronomy and earth science, telling stories that feature characters learning about space in a way that is accessible to children.</p><p>Before appearing on television, Ready Jet Go was leaked on the PBS Kids video app. As a result, Ready Jet Go! has received critical acclaim, a million streams online, and the highest ratings on PBS Kids, including 7.6 million kids on linear television. Ready Jet Go has an app called Space Explorer. The App was featured as &#145;Best New App&#146; on the front page of the US App Store and hit #1 free app in Kids and #2 free app in Education. In August 2016, Ready Jet Go was renewed for a second season, which premiered on April 2, 2018.</p><p><em>Ready Jet Go!</em> also now has a <a class="urllink" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/crowner.php/BestEpisode/ReadyJetGo?open=all#hxtbkb17">Best Episode Crowner<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, so if you'd like to make your choice for the best episode of the series known, now's your chance.</p><p>The show's last episode aired on June 17, 2019.

He idolizes Neil Armstrong heavily, to the point of obsession, and wishes to be like him, but he can&#146;t. Sean also fears cramped spaces, heights, and easily gets space-sick (and sick in general), which are things that are preventing him from becoming an astronaut. Despite wanting to be an astronaut, he heavily fears space, and is constantly forced by his friends to go. They never allow him to stay on Earth. He&#146;s also somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> within the group, and no one listens to him when he suggest using the Scientific Method to solve problems.

Further more, Lillian is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder">Agent Mulder</a> who is purely good, while Mitchell is a firm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">Agent Scully</a> who hides his good traits. Despite this, the very little amount of interaction they had in "That's One Gigantic Pumpkin, Jet Propulsion!" seems to prove that they are on somewhat good terms with each other.

Sean likes science facts and sometimes doesn't understand imagination being used in science.

Their lines are <em>It's not too hot, and not too freezing / And is suitable for breathing / Not too big / And not too small / And planet Earth is what its called!</em>. Later, during the Just Add Water song, the cast sing these lines: <em>Plus it's not too hot, and no, it's not too freezing / Add to which its atmosphere is suitable for breathing / It's really not too big / And really not too small / And planet Earth is what its called!</em></li><li> At one point, Jet says "What do you call those things in cities that shoot water in the air?", and Sydney and Sean respond with "Fountains.".

Without the landing gear, the landing will be difficult.

Carrot and Celery are truly loving parents aren't abusive, deceased, neglectful, or 100% perfect goody-two-shoes. They're realistic, rounded-out, loving parents who both have well-paying jobs and are both there to support their kid. The other kids love their parents too. Sean is proud of his mother's work at the DSA, and Sydney sees her mother as a role model.</li><li> <em>Philia</em> (Friendship): From the moment he landed on Earth, Jet has been best friends with Sean, Sydney, and Mindy, and they are inseparable. Throughout the show, Jet learns about traditional childhood activities and in turn, takes his friends on epic sci-fi adventures.

At one point in the movie, Mindy wakes up at midnight and tries to make Jet 2 put the hologram of the house back, and Jet 2 instead projects many other holograms that can only be seen if you pause. The holograms include Sean standing with his hands folded, that same hologram with Sean's mouth closed, a hologram of Sydney, a hologram of Sean in his space-suit, the weather balloon from "My Fair Jet", a hologram of Mitchell cackling, a hologram of Sunspot in a Greek outfit from "Jet's Time Machine", a hologram of Mindy in her pajamas on the flying saucer, and a hologram of the pineapple jack-o-lantern from "Jet's First Halloween".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">Freeze Ray</a>: Sunspot builds one for Mindy in "Mindy's Ice Rink".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>: Zerk, mostly because he was a racist bigot to the Earthies in the past, and he is quite irritating.

She is also more emotional, kind, and loving than any of the group.</li><li> Sean is the Superego. Sean is studious and smart, and wants to grow up to be a great scientist and lead the first human mission to Mars. Sean is also concerned about his grades most of the time and uses the Scientific Method, as well as logical reasoning, to solve problems. Due to this, he has a terrible imagination.</li><li> Jet is the Ego. While Sean and Sydney are polar opposites, Jet is one of the sole reasons why they hang together and the arrival of Jet pretty much brought them together. Jet is talented at acting, singing, and dancing, and is curious about everything, especially Earth. Jet is also kind and generous, and always has a positive attitude and great leadership skills.</li><li> The younger kids trio fits into this as well:<ul><li> Lillian is the Id. She's the most emotional and loving of all of them, and she easily believes that Halloween is magical.</li><li> Mitchell is the Superego. Mitchell is nerdy and tries to use logic and reasoning when dealing with strange things. He's also a bit of a jerk.</li><li> Mindy is the Ego. She's Lillian's best friend and Mitchell's (speculated) crush, which is why they both hang out with her. She easily balances them out.</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Rafferty, Dr. Bergs, and Dr. Skelley end up forming one in "Astronaut Ellen Ochoa". Dr. Bergs is the Id, because he's the most emotional of the trio. Dr. Rafferty is the Superego, since she seems more composed than Bergs, though that's not saying much. Dr. Skelley is the Ego, being the middle point between the two and the most level-headed one.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemy</a>: Mitchell is this to Jet and his group.

Mindy's mom is heard, but not shown, and her dad is also nowhere to be seen. And Sydney's parents have been neither seen or shown, though Sydney's mom appeared in the season 1 finale, and makes frequent appearances in season 2.</li><li> As for Lillian, she is confirmed to have a mom in "Mindy Turns Five", but is unknown if she has a father.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEchoCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEchoCut">Ironic Echo Cut</a>: The episode "Castaway Carrot" has this exchange:<div class="indent"> <strong>Celery</strong>: Way the by, your dad is fine.

When he wins the soapbox derby, he is the only one cheering for him and even asks anyone if they wants autographs from him, but instead everyone is looking up at and cheering Jet (who was parachuting) even though he lost the derby. Mitchell is the <em>complete</em> opposite of Jet, who is very selfless and tries not to expose his alien identity because he doesn't want to be a celebrity and leave his friends.</li><li> Also in "Racing on Sunshine", before the race starts, Mitchell boasts that he was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">ready to retire</a>", but Cody convinced him to race again.

Episodes supporting this are "Detective Mindy", "You Can Call Me Albedo", and especially "Holidays in Boxwood Terrace".</li><li> This is what becomes of Sean's western persona in "Lone Star 2 - Rocket Kids!". In the first "Lone Star" episode, Western!Sean was disapproving of Lone Star's ideas.

He eventually learned that he needed his friends' noise for the experiment. And, it's easy to sympathize with both parties: Sean wanted peace and quiet, while his friends just wanted to help and stopped bothering Sean when he asked them to.</li><li> In "Ain't No Mars Mountain High Enough", Sunspot grabs this. He refuses help from the other kids and refuses to team up with Celery.

Western!Sean claims that if people are looking up at the stars all night, they will be tired in the morning and won't be able to cut down trees or dig for gold.</li><li> In "That's One Gigantic Pumpkin, Jet Propulsion!", Mindy and Lillian keep insisting that Halloween is magical, while Mitchell repeatedly refutes their claims. Yes, he was rather blunt about it, but he did have a point that the stuff that they said were real like demonic spiders, ghosts, and witches are fake.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">Jet Pack</a>: Jet has one.

Sydney is obsessed with science fiction and comics, and idolizes a character named Commander Cressida. She is very imaginative and likes to think creatively in situations, as well as create her own fanfictions about Commander Cressida in the treehouse. She correctly states that science-fiction ideas have inspired many technological innovations and advances, that scientists are as inspired by what they saw on Star Trek as anything in a scientific journal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Sean</a> represents science facts. In contrast to Sydney, who likes fiction, Sean is all about the facts. Sean likes to do things the old-fashioned way and does not like change as much as the others do, and he's got a hard time using his imagination as shown in "Backyard Moon Base", however he does come from a family of scientists AND astronauts, so he figures he's going to be a great scientist himself, and likes to use the Scientific Method to solve problems. He also wants to lead the first human mission to Mars, despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">he gets space-sick easily, is afraid of cramped spaces, and has a fear of heights</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker">Mindy</a> represents curiosity.

Mindy doesn't know a whole lot about science, and is far too young to go into space with the others, but she&#146;s welcomed into the group, treated as an equal, and never talked down to. Mindy is often the reason for the episodes' plots. Due to her curiosity, she often asks a basic, kid-friendly question about space which prompts the kids to look for an answer, either by going into space or by staying on Earth.</li><li> And rounding out the main cast of children, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Jet Propulsion</a>, who is the coolest kid ever, and an ambassador for space. Jet embodies what the other children represent. Jet is creative, and being <em>from</em> outer space, and having travel-doc parents, he knows a whole lot about it, and he's very curious to learn about Earth and its customs. Jet also represents how the creators of this show want the target audience to see Earth: with a sense of curiosity and wonder. Jet is continuously amazed by our lush and beautiful planet, and as such, wants to protect it, since it is his current residence. The episode "Tiny Blue Dot" proves this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Rule of Three</a>: In "My Three Suns", the kids have three daymares as to what it would be like to live on a planet with 3 suns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>:<ul><li> Mindy not being able to go into space due to not being allowed to go anywhere past Jet's yard.</li><li> The Propulsions messing up on Earth words and traditions.</li><li> Jet almost exposing his identity.</li><li> Sean being nervous when going into space.</li><li> Sean singing the Scientific Method.</li><li> Mitchell spying on Jet.</li><li> Sunspot being silly and functioning as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.</li><li> Carrot making weird dishes.</li><li> The show having a comic book motif and using comic book transitions.</li><li> In "That's One Gigantic Pumpkin, Jet Propulsion!": zoom transitions being used any time someone calls Sunspot.</li><li> A recurring gag on the series is Jet's strange obsession with his hair.</li><li> In "Astronaut Ellen Ochoa", Sean exercising while doing math problems.</li><li> In "My Three Suns", Face 9000 trying to be a comedian.</li><li> In "Mars Rock for Mom", Jet being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetfulJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetfulJones">Forgetful Jones</a> and leaving his stuff behind.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">Samus Is a Girl</a>: A variant occurs in "Solar Power Rover".

They force Jet to undergo training to behave like a human kid. The first half of the episode seems light-hearted as normal, but then we get the revelation that <em>there's a reason</em> that the Open House needs to go well: if it doesn't, then all funding will be cut from the DSA. It starts raining, and the weather balloon flies away. Sean grabs onto it, and he gets carried with it, <strong>and is on the brink of death by almost slipping off</strong>. Jet saves Sean from death, and then sings about how he is Bortronian, exposing his alien identity to the whole neighborhood (not that Sean and Sydney cared, they were just glad that Sean was okay).
