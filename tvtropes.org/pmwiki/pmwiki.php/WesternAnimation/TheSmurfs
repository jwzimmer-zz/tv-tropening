Though as time went on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanSeries">live-action kids' shows as well as other family-friendly media</a> began taking over the airwaves, meaning ratings started to go down and the future of established Saturday morning cartoons became uncertain. Eventually, animated studios and network programmers fell into a pattern of reusing popular formulas, some taking characters from their most popular shows and pairing them together in order to make them "perform" or "compete" much like how their live-action counterparts in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom">Sitcoms</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a> did on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime">Prime Time</a> shows.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In 1979, television executive and producer Fred Silverman turned President and CEO of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> brought his daughter a plush Smurf doll from a local toy shop during a network trip to Aspen, Colorado. Upon his return, Silverman contacted cofounder Joseph Barbera of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera Productions</a>, charging him on acquiring the rights to the Smurfs, guaranteeing the studio an on-air commitment if they could make an animated cartoon series around the Belgian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">comics</a>. Doing as he was told, Barbera began a two-year trip to the television screen, veering the Smurfs far from Pierre "Peyo" Culliford's 1958 creation before coming back to a familiar form.</p><p>Even though the contract Peyo had with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>, S.E.P.P.

They included changing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">'The Black Smurfs'</a> from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Les Schtroumpfs noirs</a>" to purple as well as changing the 'Swoofs', which are basically the Smurfs in disguise to green from the reddish orange skin tone from "Le Cosmoschtroumpf" ("The Astrosmurf"). Hanna-Barbera also changed Brainy from being whacked on the head with a blunt object as punishment in the printed stories to being physically thrown out of the Smurf Village in the cartoon, which was later carried into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs">2011 movie</a>, in fear of young viewers hitting those they despise on the head.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The <em>Smurfs</em> animated series finally debuted on Saturday morning of September 12, 1981, capturing forty two percent of the audience, thus making it the most highly rated children's program in more than eight years, not to mention the highest rated program on NBC in roughly two decades. <em>Smurfs</em> even outperformed a number of successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime">prime time</a> shows in terms of viewing percentages.

Johan and Pirlouit, called Peewit in English, made their television debut in the second season, becoming recurring characters as well as Bigmouth, who only made one appearance in the comics. Gargamel, Azrael, Princess Savina, the King, Dame Barbra and Homnibus made their animated appearances from the comics as well.
