Peter gets bitten by a genetically altered spider developed by Oscorp, and his classic villains have a set of powers and skills that are slightly different from how readers expect them to be. But fundamentally Peter is motivated by the guilt of his Uncle's death, by the idea that "With Great Power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">Comes Great Responsibility</a>" and as the series evolves he comes to be the moral and emotional center of the entire Ultimate Marvel universe, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Hope Bringer</a> for his friends, loved ones, and allies.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>After a six-month <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum">Ultimatum</a></em>, the series was re-launched as <em>Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man</em> until the comic reached its 150th issue (counting both pre- and post-Ultimatum issues) and returned to its original numbering and naming format for 10 issues. The series ended with issue 160, followed by the miniseries <em>Ultimate Fallout</em>. A third volume came out with a new character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a> and the title <em>Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, Volume 2</em> or <em>Ultimate Comics: <strong>All-New</strong> Spider-Man</em> with new numbering. In 2012, as part of the 50th anniversary of Spider-Man titles, the first 616 and Ultimate Universe crossover, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMen">Spider-Men</a></em> was launched, which saw the 616 Peter arrive into the ultimate universe and meet Miles.

A version of the game's plot and events was adapted between USM #123-128 ("War of the Symbiotes").

The panel seemingly implied that Peter would develop organic webbing, but later issues show him developing the web shooters. The reasons for that panel are never elaborated again.</li><li> For a short-time, Flash Thompson kept pestering Peter to talk to him privately, but Peter continually blew Flash off due to Flash still being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> at the time.

It's worth noting that he's the <em>only</em> person to figure out that Peter's Spider-Man, even though their entire class saw Peter get bitten by a spider they had just been told was part of an Oscorp experiment roughly a week before Spider-Man showed up. The series at least treats this as realistically as they can while still not giving his identity away, by having Kong repeatedly try to tell Flash and Liz what he's figured out, but having them so thoroughly disrespect Peter that they <em>refuse</em> to believe it, coming up with one excuse after another why it can't be true.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a>: One occurred in the first arc, when Norman tested the Oz serum on himself &mdash; caught in the explosion was Otto Octavius <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Harry Osborn</a></span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kitty</span> goes into a pretty epic one in chapter 10 of <em>Ultimate Comics</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unable to tolerate the hatred and intolerance she gets for being a mutant any longer, she absolutely blows her stack, lashing out violently at her friends for not fighting to defend her and even going so far as to declare "Magneto was RIGHT!"</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a>: Wolverine and Spidey.

This gets to the point that we discover that there's an entire section of S.H.I.E.L.D prison dedicated to containing "illegal genetic tampering", something which Spidey himself is considered (although, because he's a good guy, Fury plans to instead initiate him into the Ultimates when he comes of age, as opposed to arresting him). The end of the "Venom" storyline had Dr. Conners drunkenly muse to Peter as to whether or not it's coincidence that so many people have screwed with their genetics and wound up evil from it. Several characters also muse that maybe the sudden influx of super-powered insanity is a sign that something big is coming, like a harbinger of the apocalypse. It's first mentioned by Kong, who uses <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters (1984)</a></em> as part of the analogy.

Mary Jane imagined that he could have been greater than Captain America and led the Ultimates. Aunt May imagined that he would infuse his science ability with his heroics and start a Spider-Man-esque Future Foundation. Gwen referenced personal discussions with Peter Parker, and stated that he wanted to be a reporter so that people with money could not escape wrong doings so he could use his heroics as Spider-Man to break the story. Kitty Pryde dismissed herself from discussing it, but her panel alluding to her imagination had her and Peter growing up together and being married. Miles cited that if he got his act together and met up with Peter sooner, he would be a partner if not a sidekick.
