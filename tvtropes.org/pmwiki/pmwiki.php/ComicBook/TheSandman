Described as "A story about stories," <em>The Sandman</em> was a comic series that could tell any tale, in any time period, in any style or setting. Historical figures were common, as were allusions and homages to many classic works such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a></em> and the plays of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. The series lasted for 75 issues, from January, 1989 to March, 1996, with a one-shot special in November, 1991. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> mini-series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandmanOverture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandmanOverture">The Sandman: Overture</a></em>, was released in 2013, the original series' 25th anniversary, and was written by Gaiman with art by J H Williams III.</p><p>At the center of the series is Dream, also known as Morpheus, the Sandman, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">dozens of other titles.</a> He rules over the dreaming world that mortals enter when they sleep, and he is also the patron of writers and storytellers, (he is described as "The lord of all that is not, and shall never be.") since a story and a dream are in many ways the same thing. As old as the universe and more powerful than many gods, Dream is vain, proud, and stiff-necked. Throughout the series, tragedy and suffering teach him humility and compassion for others, but it's hard to change for the better when you're billions of years old and very set in your ways...</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Like many experimental comic book series of its era (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AnimalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AnimalMan">Animal Man</a></em>), <em>The Sandman</em> is ostensibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">reboot</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">revival</a> of a third-string character from DC's early days, whom Gaiman was given free license to play with as much as he wanted. Hence, the series' name is taken from a detective series created by Gardner Fox in the 1930s, which followed the adventures of a gas-masked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">private detective</a> who put criminals to sleep with anasthetic gas. But while most of Gaiman's contemporaries at least kept the general premise of the characters that they were working with, Gaiman essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">just took the name and ran with it</a>. The original Sandman is given a token mention in the first issue, and Dream often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">wears a helmet that resembles a gas mask</a>&mdash;but other than that, the story is wholly original.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The series attracted a huge number of fans from groups who aren't traditionally seen as readers of comics, most notably young women. By the end of its run, it was selling better than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>, had attained heaps of critical praise and industry awards, and became the first and only comic book to win the prestigious World Fantasy Award For Short Fiction. The oft-told story that the rules were changed to make comics totally ineligible is false; they were merely barred from the Short Fiction category. Comics have since been nominated under the Special Award Professional category.</p><p>These days, new readers usually consume the series via ten oft-reprinted trade paperbacks, each containing an entire storyline or a series of related short stories. The series has spawned a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> series by both Gaiman and other writers as notable characters from the books tell their tales.</p><p>The collected trade paperbacks:</p><ul><li> <em>Preludes and Nocturnes</em>: In the early 20th century, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain">English</a> occult sect attempts to imprison Death with a summoning ritual, but mistakenly snares Dream instead. Following seven decades of imprisonment in the waking world, Dream must avenge his kingdom and retrieve his scattered relics of power.</li><li> <em>The Doll's House</em>: Dream is forced to enter the waking world to track down a trio of rogue nightmares, and must get to the bottom of a mysterious "Dream Vortex" that threatens to tear apart the Dreaming. Along the way, he crosses paths with a young woman named Rose Walker, who gets caught up in a labyrinthine world of secrets after discovering the family that she never knew.</li><li> <em>Dream Country</em>: A collection of four unrelated one-shot stories. A frustrated writer looks for inspiration in the supernatural; a cat recalls a fateful encounter with Dream; a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> pays back a debt to Dream with a trippy performance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidsummerNightsDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidsummerNightsDream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em>; a burned-out superhero looks to Death for respite from her tortuous existence.</li><li> <em>Season of Mists</em>: Dream is drawn into a perilous game of supernatural intrigue when he decides to confront his old enemy Lucifer Morningstar, the Lord of Hell, in a bid to rescue a past lover condemned to his kingdom. Things then proceed to go in directions that <em>none</em> of the participants quite expected.</li><li> <em>A Game of You</em>: Trying to put her life back together after a failed relationship, a young woman named Barbie (introduced in <em>The Doll's House</em>) rediscovers the world of her old childhood fantasies in a most unexpected way, and is unwittingly caught in the middle of a struggle against a deadly being known as "The Cuckoo."</li><li> <em>Fables and Reflections</em>: A series of stories about mortal encounters with the Endless, spanning from medieval Arabia, to Renaissance-era <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Italy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Italy">Italy</a>, to post-Revolution <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a>, to mythic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greece">Greece</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">Ancient Rome</a>. Includes the tragic tale of Dream's last meeting with his estranged son: The legendary Greek bard Orpheus.</li><li> <em>Brief Lives</em>: Dream pairs up with his unpredictable younger sister, Delirium, for a road trip into the waking world to seek out their long-lost elder brother: The rogue seventh member of The Endless, Destruction.</li><li> <em>World's End</em>: After being caught in a "reality storm," two mortal humans are forced to seek refuge at an inn at the End of the Universe, where they're treated to a night of storytelling by a procession of supernatural creatures. Heady meditations on death, deception, hope and urban alienation follow.</li><li> <em>The Kindly Ones</em>: Lyta Hall, a woman whose life was changed forever by a fateful encounter with Dream, turns to some unlikely supernatural allies when her infant son mysteriously vanishes. As Dream confronts enemies on all sides, every character introduced in the series thus far (major and minor) confronts their destinies.</li><li> <em>The Wake</em>: In the wake of a momentous battle, the denizens of the Dreaming come together for some sober reflection as they confront the uncertain future of their world.</li></ul><p>The series also had more spinoffs than we can sensibly list here.

Though not writing any of the new titles himself, Gaiman serves as a creative consultant, and helped select each of their creative teams. Despite Vertigo's eventual retirement as an imprint in 2019, it was confirmed that the Sandman Universe will continue to run as DC titles.</p><p>After years in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">development hell</a>, it was announced in December 2013 that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/joseph-gordon-levitt-eyeing-sandman-as-director-star-producer-at-warner-bros">a film adaptation was in the works<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, to be produced by Gaiman, David S.

Overall, the trope is thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a>: what is it like to personify a timeless concept, especially a tragic one, like Death or Despair or Destruction? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToInherentNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToInherentNature">Are you eternally bound to your cosmic duty,</a> or is your role in the universe escapable?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Dream is often pretty unsympathetic, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">kicks the dog</a> quite a lot.

In a later tie-in book, <em>Death: The High Cost of Living</em>, Death takes on human form and wanders the earth for a day, a tradition she performs once every century; this tradition is mentioned in the original series and is a more literal vacation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>: Haroun Al Raschid in issue #50, <em>Ramadan,</em> is a wise and capable ruler.

Then it turns out that the first issue spans <em>70 freakin' years</em>. As Dream points out, patiently waiting a human lifetime is easy for the Endless, and even if he hadn't figured out how to escape, he could've simply waited for the building in which he was imprisoned to crumble to dust. By the time Dream gets free, Roderick has died of old age and his son Alex is a harmless, senile old man. Dream leaves Alex in a permanent nightmare and never sees him again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He wakes up at the end of <em>The Kindly Ones</em> when Dream dies, as there was nothing keeping him in the nightmare.

Most characters eventually solidified into consistent designs, though.<ul><li> Lucifer is a pretty dramatic case of this; his first depiction was as a fairly waifish young man, while beginning in <em>Season of Mists</em> he was depicted as being taller and much more chiseled, with shorter hair. This depiction was kept a bit more consistent afterwards.</li><li> Doctor Destiny had his appearance dramatically altered by Mike Dringenberg, after Sam Kieth left the series. This was noticeable, though, because it happened <em>in the very next issue</em>.</li><li> The entire "Kindly Ones" arc is particularly noted as having dissimilar art to the entire rest of the <em>series</em>, as Marc Hempel's style was <em>radically</em> different from earlier series artists like Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg &amp; Malcolm Jones, who originally defined the "look" of the series. Funnily enough, Hempel actually <em>does</em> manage to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">deviating from previously-locked-down character appearances</a>, but his style is just so <em>different</em> that a number of characters end up looking rather different anyway.</li><li> Delirium's appearance constantly changes from story to story; there are times when she's even drawn differently between <em>scenes</em>, but in her case this actually makes a kind of sense.</li><li> In a way, it's justified for all the Endless, since how they appear is mostly a matter of perception, anyway (and there are even a few gags based around this, including Orpheus' memorable trip to Death's... "house"). In one scene, the Martian Manhunter and Mr. Miracle are both speaking to Dream. Mr. Miracle sees him in his familiar white-skinned form, while the Martian Manhunter simultaneously sees him in the form of Mars' ancient god of sleep&mdash;a giant blazing Martian head.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife">Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life</a>:<ul><li> Destruction at some point in his life realizes that people will always destroy and change things, without his interference.
