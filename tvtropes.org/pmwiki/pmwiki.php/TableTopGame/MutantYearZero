Which is published under Free League Publishing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ModiphiusEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ModiphiusEntertainment">Modiphius Entertainment</a>. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic</a> RPG set a few decades after the end of the world, where you and others get to play as a race of super-powered mutants. All of whom are attempting to rebuild their sanctuary, 'The Ark', and survive in the hostile 'Zone' outside The Ark's protection and within The Dawnworld's clutches. Unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantUA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantUA">Mutant UA</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantChronicles">Mutant Chronicles</a></em> which took the ideas of the series in vastly different directions; <em>Mutant: Year Zero</em> attempts to remain as close and as faithful as it possibly can to the original premise of the series that was established back in 1984. This includes building off of a more traditional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a></em> inspired world and setting as opposed to a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> clone or Victorian-esque sci-fi setting.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Mutant: Year Zero</em> has several additional Source Books and nine Supplements which act as their own separate adventures, whilst the three Source Books adventures occur tangentially to the Core Rule Book. The Core Rule Book has players take on the roles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">Mutants</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfThePeople">The People</a>, attempting to find 'Eden' and find a cure for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague">barrenness</a>. For The People can not have children and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildlessDystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildlessDystopia">no children</a> it's only a matter of time before they die out. As The People are only made up of around two-hundred Mutants all together with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">slowly diminishing population</a>, that shrinks at the end of every session depending on the result of a six-sided dice. 'Eden' is their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">only hope</a> if they wish to survive and continue The People's culture and legacy in the 'Zone'. The first Source Book is called <em>Genlab Alpha</em>, with the players taking on the roles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Mutated Animals</a>. Unlike the human Mutants, the Animals aren't barren and have been steadily growing their population since the end of the world. But they've all been tapped in an enclosure called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName">Paradise</a> Valley, which is controlled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">ruthless machines</a> that act as the Animals' jailers. The Goal of <em>Genlab Alpha</em> is for the Players to build a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Resistance Force</a> against their oppressors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapedfromtheLab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapedfromtheLab">escape Paradise</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The second Source Book is called <em>Mechatron</em>, this time the players take on the role of newly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">sentient Robots</a> experiencing freedom and independent thought from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">The Collective</a> that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotsEnslavingRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotsEnslavingRobots">controlled</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">Overarching A.I. NODOS</a>. The Robots adapt to any and all situations they encounter and could potentially live on forever, because of this fact they have adapted and learnt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming">question their existence</a> which has given them the ability to gain self awareness in the time since the end of the world. <em>Mechatron</em> is set in a self-producing facility deep underwater called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity">Mechatron-7</a>. Players are assigned to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Error Elimination Unit</a>, with the mission of investigating Mechatron-7's Robotic denizens in the hope of learning and solving it's issues. Since gaining sentience, the Robots have become aware of their environment and learnt that Mechatron-7 is falling into ruin. Their programming originally blinded them to this reality, but now the veil has been lifted and Mechatron-7 is dying. The Robots must fight for whatever resources remain so that they and Mechatron-7 will survive.</p><p>The third Source Book is called <em>Elysium</em>; where players play as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Heir</a> to one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourPhilosophyEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourPhilosophyEnsemble">Four</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Titan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Houses</a> for ten-thousand of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">last remaining humans</a> living deep underneath Earth in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elysium-I</a>. Before the end of the World; a powerful covenant of Four Houses built dozens of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcology">Enclaves</a> across the world, in the hopes of ensuring humanity's survival after the end. These Enclaves were built in veneration of the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast">19th century</a>, where the woes and conflicts of the 20th and 21st century were forgotten and never to be repeated again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">Unfortunately</a> these Enclaves began a devastating war against one another soon after the end of the world, with only Elysium-I being the last reaming Enclave. The Four Houses attempted to isolate Elysium-I and its citizens from the rest of the world, by imposing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianEdict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianEdict">draconian law</a> and quelling dissidents. This has grown heavy animosity against the Four Houses with the lower classes and may result in a civil war that Elysium-I can't survive; that's where the players come in, they are assigned as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner">Judicators</a> from their chosen House to squash the growing rebellion amongst the Elysium-I masses whilst secretly securing their own House's power.</p><p>The fourth (and theoretically final) Source Book is the upcoming <em>Ad Astra</em>, about the Titan Powers who escaped into Earth's orbit and survive on dotted space stations far removed from the decaying surface. No release date is yet known for this book.</p><p></p><h2>The game provides examples of:</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A to F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGuild">Adventure Guild</a>: Blackhand&#146;s Bar, owned by the eponymous four-armed Mutant himself, is designed to emulate the classic adventuring hub. It is a place full of rumors, where the PCs can find missions to take them to other thrilling locations in the Zone. The GM can also introduce their players to NPCs from other <em>Special Zone Sectors</em> as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: No one really knows how the world came to an end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except the Heads of the Elysium families,</span> but what is known is that it was more than just one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>: Almost all forms of artificial intelligence in <em>Mutant: Year Zero</em>'s world has a trend of going off the deep end, either naturally over time or forcibly by others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholIsGasoline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholIsGasoline">Alcohol Is Gasoline</a>: The alcohol that's brewed in <em>Year Zero's</em> world is so damn strong that it can have any vehicle running up to one square mile for every dose of Booze that's placed in the tank.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllHailTheGreatGodMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllHailTheGreatGodMickey">All Hail the Great God Mickey!</a>: Because so many understand very little about The Dawnworld surrounding them it has resulted in a lot of fear and paranoia to engulfed the minds of the gullible, making them part with their rational thinking. Which follows with them worshiping whatever they believe to hold their salvation. With The Nova Cult worshiping a live rocket in a missile silo; the animals sacrificing and giving tributes to effigies, made in the supposed likeness of ancient humans; the robots seeking answers to their existence from their long dead creators; and the Elysians viewing old world knowledge and the surviving Eminences as akin to holy text and living prophets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: Whatever vague hints that are mentioned in any of the books, that directly reference our modern day, do not paint a one-to-one parallel of our present. In fact there are more hits to suggest that <em>Year Zero</em>'s world diverged from ours some thirty-odd years ago.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMasterMakesTheirOwnTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMasterMakesTheirOwnTools">A Master Makes Their Own Tools</a>: Two of the three <em>Talents</em> that are exclusive to The <em>Warrior</em> class, allow them to forge their own melee weapons as well as master any chosen melee weapon they want.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">Amazing Technicolor Population</a>: It's basically a given with The Mutants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a>: The <em>Lair of the Saurians Special Zone Sector</em> has an entire population of Mutant Lizards that are lead by a single male, whilst the rest of the species are female. Most, if not all, of these reptiles are cunning hunters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Ambiguously Human</a>: Many of the Humanoid creatures can be qualify as this, as this is due to the Mutants' own warped perception and understanding of what a human is. Because such an understanding has been skewed by how their people look on the Ark and how alien those outside the Ark are to them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Ambiguous Situation</a>: There is almost no history of how The Nova Cult came to be and their origins are a complete mystery even to themselves. Playing into their mysterious nature; it's like they just appeared from thin air in The Zone. The only reliable information about them is that they came from a distant Ark in The Dawn World beyond the PCs' Zone, but whatever Plutonia tells the PCs is most likely a well crafted fabrication devoid of any truth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousTimePeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousTimePeriod">Ambiguous Time Period</a>: There's no established time period that defines when and where <em>Year Zero</em>'s timeline diverged from ours nor how long ago the apocalypse happened; all that can be estimated is that <em>Year Zero</em> takes place around two to three-hundred years after the end of the world. This is evident due to the major story Enclaves having been built Post-Collapse and Pre-Enclave War, with some of the computer systems still being operational. But this is still speculatory at best, when one factors in certain events and places.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">A Million Is a Statistic</a>: Averted, the end of the world happened and many billions of people died as a great cost. The game emphasizes this loss by having the populations of the PC's races act as an in-game timer, a timer that tics down every session with a six-sided dice roll. So there's only so much of a stable population in the Core Rule Book and Source Books; around two hundred in The Ark, one-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety in Genlab and just about ten-thousand in Elysium-I. The robots of Mechatron-7 are incalculable so the timer is replaced with an energy timer, were as Elysium-I has a chaos/control meter.

As a result of their imperfect cloning, The Macrons and Franciscas are unstable; any skill checks made by a Macron or Francisca clone will result in <em>Trauma</em> equal to the amount of dice that land on a one, even without a <em>Push</em> roll.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">Cool Airship</a>: One of the new <em>Projects</em> found at the end of the <em>Elysium</em> Source Book allows players to build an Airship that can carry up to ten passengers and enables safe traversal of The Zone without being exposed to its many threats.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Cool Sword</a>: The Katanas found in The Zones can qualify as this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain">Cool Train</a>: The Train is one of the most lucrative <em>Projects</em> that The Ark can have; once the required <em>Railroad</em> and <em>Train</em> <em>Projects</em> have been completed that is.

Meaning that there's no luxury of finding a stable settlement that's not struggling or falling apart at the seems. The world is covered in lethal background radiation that has mutated into a miasma simply called The Rot; a poison that literally eats away at the PCs until it eventually kills them.

The game offers a way to try and re-roll the result again at the risk of suffering <em>Trauma</em> to the <em>Attribute</em> being used. These are called <em>Push</em> rolls; the player picks up any of the dice that has not landed on a one or a six and rolls them again, but each dice that landed on a previously or newly rolled one now counts as <em>Trauma</em> to that PC's <em>Attribute</em> score.

As replacing large parts of the human body with artificial machine prosthetics could trigger violent side effects. The researchers came to call these symptoms Machine Fever. These are caused by <em>Push</em> rolls using a <em>Biomechatronic Implant</em>'s <em>Gear Bonus</em>, which makes the player roll on an <em>Injury Table</em> for their PC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a>: This is what Elysium-I has become since the Enclave Wars, with a Victorian twist in design.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a>: There are several, the most well known is the luminescent child by the Nova Cultists.

Making Mechatron-7's collapse inevitable; however this is later averted as NODOS tells the players that The Collective was meant to evolve with self-awareness, because NODOS was one of the first machines to gain sentience.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a>: A few <em>Mutations</em>, <em>Animal Powers</em>, <em>Modulus</em> and <em>Contacts</em> seem underwhelming at first, but a resourceful player can utilize many of them to fit their needs should the situation come about.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Hidden Backup Prince</a>: All Heir PCs are considered to be this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWeapons">Hidden Weapons</a>: An Elysium-I <em>Biomechatronical Implant</em> called <em>Weapon Mount</em> which allows any (portable) weapon to be mounted in the arm.

There's also more bizarre weather, like an inertia field which slows down time to a crawl for anyone outside whilst speeding it up for others inside; to others like deadly Rot winds or a sudden vacuum in areas devoid of air.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsSuperior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsSuperior">Humanity Is Superior</a>: When comparing pure baseline Humans to Mutants, Animals or Robots stat-wise, they're far more healthy and stronger when compared to any of the first three. This is because all humans in Elysium-I were all controlled and monitored so that no dangers of inbreeding or abnormalities would taint whatever remained of the human gene pool. This is reflected in-game with humans having one or two more <em>Attribute Points</em> than all other races depending on their age. Meaning that a Judicator could take up to two psionic mutations and suffer little draw backs, unless they take a third, other than a significant blow to their <em>Reputation</em> stat and no initial <em>Contact/s</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>: A significant number of the creatures in The Dawnworld and its Zones are this, some even share origins from humanity itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligentForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligentForest">Intelligent Forest</a>: In the <em>Denizens of the Sink Hole Special Zone</em>, a large population of Mutants have taken up refuge in a crater due to a massive sinkhole consuming a whole city block into the ground. Within this hole live a number of tribal Mutant clans, a collective of called the Uptops, and below them is the Downbelowers a hive mind of plants, animals and mutants called The Verdure.

The irony is that the only way their species can repopulate their numbers and thrive is by integrating outsiders from The Zone, such as the Ghouls, the Wanderers and The Mutant Animals. So that their children can be born from non-mutant genes.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Animal Mutants of Genlab Alpha worshiped and glorified their human creators, going so far as to create effigies in their likeness. Needless to say it becomes quite a shock when The Animal Mutants learn the truth; that they were being maliciously experimented on by the Watchers under the command of humans. Then when they're confronted with the realization that the resistance was created by The Cyber as a grand experiment and not only that but; the fact that the only human left in Genlab Alpha has stripped themselves of their humanity because The Cyber, Chronos, is that last human.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Robots of Mechatron-7 are gaining sentience above The Collective and NODOS' commands, The Error Elimination Unit are also quickly realizing that every robotic system machine has been infected by Pinocchio Virus including themselves. But the most damning thing is that NODOS, the overarching system AI of Mechatron-7, is the cause. As the self-learning AI they were given was predicted to evolve to a point of self-sentience, due to the spread across The Collective starting from the most advanced robot downward. So unless NODOS wants to wipe all the cumulative memory and reset all machines in Mechatron-7, he'd have to start with himself and loose every bit of knowledge and programming he has accumulated.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a>: The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> Talent</em> allows Players to multi-class their PCs; but they must have three prior talents before this one and once they pick this <em>Talent</em> they're unable to put any more points in their original <em>Specialist Skill</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner">Judge, Jury, and Executioner</a>: This is the role of The Judicators, as their role is to keep order in Elysium-I however means necessary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">Katanas Are Just Better</a>: In the base game, Katanas are the best melee weapon a Mutant is lucky enough to find in The Zone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">Killer Game Master</a>: Played with, whilst the game is already hard on it's own.

Each system uses allocated points that are rewarded differently depending on the race, but equal to the amount of powers you have at the start of a session. <em>Mutation Points</em> (<em>MP</em>) and <em>Feral Points</em> (<em>FP</em>) for the Mutants and Animals are awarded by <em>Push</em> rolls; <em>Energy Points</em> (<em>EP</em>) for Robots can only be awarded by energy; and <em>Influence Points</em> (<em>IP</em>) for Humans can only be awarded by cultivating your Judicator contacts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveRaceSelection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveRaceSelection">Massive Race Selection</a>: When players combine the Core Rule Book and all three additional Source Books, it amounts to twelve separate races to choose from. Although admittedly, this is narrowed down due to the tribes of the Mutated Animals. But if players were to separate the individual animal types from their tribes; players will be given a wide selection of at least twenty-nine races to choose from.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy">Matriarchy</a>: There are a few, but the most prominent one involves the <em>Special Zone Drifters From Afar</em>. Who are a group of two-hundred, mostly non-mutated, humans that speak a melodic language that is incomprehensible to the PCs. They are lead by old and fat village matriarchs, with women out numbering the men by four-to-one.

This is because even dedicated builds for a player's roles may not be the best for certain situations, as PCs being dead strong on their <em>Key Attribute</em> but pathetically weak on the rest may severely hamper their survivability. It can also serve as an effective character arc for a player's PC, such as a PC who starts off as <em>Slave</em> who then rises up as a <em>Boss</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernStasis">Modern Stasis</a>: It's all but confirmed that this was how the world was before the bombs dropped.

A lucky player with enough dice can thus eliminate an entire room's worth of enemies in a single round; conversely, an unlucky player might just wreck their own weapon and knock themselves out if they don't know when to quit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">Mutants</a>: It's the first race that most players will be introduced to and play as in the game. Mutants have either one or more <em>Mutations</em>, that give them abilities and powers beyond what any normal Zone-Ghoul or Wander is cable of doing. From producing glands for acidic spit or growing an additional two arms, lighting things on fire with your mind or controlling any metallic object that weights less than themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">Multi-Armed and Dangerous</a>: A potential <em>Mutant Power</em> that gives PCs four arms, which in turn also gives them the ability to attack twice in the same turn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleLifeBars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleLifeBars">Multiple Life Bars</a>: Each of the four <em>Attribute</em> scores act not only as <em>Skill</em> checks for certain rolls, but also as their own individual health bars for certain attacks. Any damage done to them results in <em>Trauma</em> to that <em>Attribute</em> and lowers the amount of dice that can be rolled on it, until it is recovered by the necessary need for recovery. If any of the <em>Attribute</em>'s scores reach zero, the player's PC or NPC becomes <em>Broken</em> and they can be killed by the next attack against them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneObjectAmazement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneObjectAmazement">Mundane Object Amazement</a>: A lot of the "<em>Artifacts</em>" found in The Zone, bar a few exceptions, are just regular simple items that we'd find in our day-to-day lives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMisfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMisfire">Mutation Misfire</a>: If a Mutant's power <em>Misfires</em> it causes them to roll on a risk table that determines what happens.

Sometimes they're better than the alternatives and their consequences, so these decisions are often made at the cost of one's moral compass or the lives of others. Sometimes killing an innocent is better to make a powerful ally rather than making an enemy of a powerful faction; sometimes freedoms must be sacrificed for the security of The Ark's future; and sometimes the "good" decision may not always be the best one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">Nuclear Nasty</a>: Most creatures in The Dawnworld and its Zones that were affected by the Rot, have been forced to adapt to the environment that has resulted in freakish abominations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanPunk">Ocean Punk</a>: The <em>Dead Blue Sea</em> supplement takes the core setting and plot of <em>Mutant: Year Zero</em> into the sea. Giving players a whole new Zone to explore and gear to play with, as well as new threats and <em>Special Zones</em> to take on. It also expands on the navel and swimming aspects of the setting.

They are composed of at least thirty Mutants, all standing no taller than four feet but lack beards, and they act more like a small fishing hamlet rather than a clan composed entirely of blacksmiths or jewel makers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">Our Ghouls Are Creepier</a>: The Zone-Ghouls are one of most challenging and numerous early game enemies the Players will first encounter in The Zone. They're generally shorter than the average mutant, moving in large carnivorous groups and always seeking to ambush unsuspecting players. They're nocturnal as they have a weakness to Sunlight, which burns their flesh despite the protective clothing of hooded cloth and plastic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse">Pint-Sized Powerhouse</a>: Due to the nature of the game being a traditional pen and paper RPG, nothing is stopping players from creating and describing their PCs as midget-sized berserkers that packs enough punch to topple an elephant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPerson">Plant Person</a>: Mutants can have one of two plant themed mutant powers, one simply called <em>Human Plant</em> and another called <em>Spores</em>. With <em>Human Plant</em> you can get nourishment from sunlight; with a body that has bark-like skin, which is also covered in sharp thorns that you can use in close combat. Whilst with <em>Spores</em>, PCs have hidden spore sacs on their bodies that are capable of spraying spore clouds against targets in a near distance. The spores can also be used to irritate a victim&#146;s eyes into blindness and cause their skin to itch with a rash. They also stink so horribly that the victim chokes or suffers severe nausea. But the cloud of spores can also help obscure you and escape from a conflict.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PollutedWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PollutedWasteland">Polluted Wasteland</a>: Due to most of the Dawnworld being contaminated with the Rot, it has left traveling the Zone a costly and hazardous endeavour.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostApunkalypticArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostApunkalypticArmor">Post-Apunkalyptic Armor</a>: A lot of the Armour fashioned by <em>Gearheads</em> are this, considering that they're forced to use whatever material they can find.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk">Post-Cyberpunk</a>: This was the original intention and design for what the Enclaves of Elysium were meant to be, but unfortunately; such a goal proved impossible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Power at a Price</a>: You can not fail activating your <em>Mutant Power</em> and depending on how much <em>MP</em> you use for that power determines how many dice must be rolled, but using them always carries a heavy risk, if any of those dice land on a one. And if a player wants to have more than one <em>Mutant Power</em> upon their PC, then they must sacrifice one <em>Attribute Point</em> on their character sheet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite">Power Parasite</a>: A <em>Mutation</em> called <em>Parasite</em> allows a PC to steal another Mutant's power to use in their next turn, but once it's used the power returns to the original host.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpgradingDeformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpgradingDeformation">Power-Upgrading Deformation</a>: This is par for the course with <em>Mutations</em>, seeing as how <em>Misfires</em> have a one in six chance of visually mutating the user.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency">Practical Currency</a>: Much like the <em>Metro</em> series, bullets are the primary source of currency. Although the market value is considerably higher, considering they're only found in the lower single digit range. Unlike <em>Metro</em>, they don't have the luxury of manufacturing new rounds <em>at all,</em> so they aren't picky with the quality. This can become a problem once the right <em>Ark Projects</em> have been completed, as the ability to mass manufacture new rounds causes them to nosedive in value as a currency. The associated games of the setting each have their own weird and practical take on it, with the animal mutants of <em>Genlab Alpha</em> trading in food, the robots of <em>Mechatron</em> using their daily energy ration, and the people of <em>Elysium</em> using standardized credits and metal coins. <em>Elysium</em> also adds the "Currency" <em>Ark/Settlement Project</em>, bringing the whole system back around.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a>: Kinda; whilst <em>Mutant UA</em> makes vague references to the major events that transpired in <em>Year Zero</em>, there are no direct references or full broken down timelines of any events that may or may not have happened. Due to each game being set two-hundred years in-universe apart and being made twelve years apart in real life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>: The Core and Source Books all have a number of blurbs, like the one quoted from above by Hanneth, that are written from the perspective of the races in their dedicated book. And a lot of the players' PC retelling of their stories are very centralized upon PCs own ideas and ethics, rather than those from an opposing party. Which is meant to lend a lot of questionability to the morality of the players' actions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink">Psychic Link</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is the specialty of The Macrons' <em>Hive Mind</em>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: They're some of the best powers a Mutant can be lucky to get, unless they're exclusively a psi-mutant, due to the sheer amount of options available to the player. From the ability to control the temperature with <em>Pyrokinesis</em> or <em>Cryokinesis</em>, to influencing and controling the fragile mind of others with <em>Mind Terror</em> or <em>Puppeteer</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickDraw">Quick Draw</a>: A <em>Talent</em> called <em>Fast Draw</em> allows PCs to draw their weapons so fast that it doesn&#146;t cost a maneuver action in their turn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadiationImmuneMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadiationImmuneMutants">Radiation-Immune Mutants</a>: Heavily averted.

It even has a massive table for scrap, which an innovative GM can use for item requirements for a <em>Gearhead's Jury-Rig Skill</em>. From bits of rubbish to heaps, nothing is considered junk despite what the random Scrap Table implies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>: This is basically what the Error Elimination Unit can be considered as in Mechatron-7, as their whole job is initially to weed out the "Errors" suffering from the Pinocchio Virus. The Judicators of the <em>Elysium</em> campaign can take on this role as well, considering their whole existence is meant to keep order in Elysium-I and weed out dissidents within the ranks of the Enclave's hierarchy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>: For obvious reasons, this is a common role for Slaves. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once the Mutants figure out they need to reproduce with non-Mutants, this can potentially becomes a crucial necessity that borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a> territory.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">Shotguns Are Just Better</a>: If Katanas and Revolvers are anything to go by.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: The <em>Scrap Table</em> is full of them, but the official Orlando Zone map takes the cake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMarket">Slave Market</a>: The <em>Slave Market Ark Project</em> allows players to purchase their own slaves so that they can fill out their cannon fodder ranks, or have a dedicated manservant for whatever their chosen need requires. Very few settlements condemn the use of slavery; it is simply too much of a lucrative market to exploit and it is often much easier to turn a blind eye to its existence rather than abolishing it, plus the added labor and bodies generated by slaves can allow for much more effective management.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMooks">Slave Mooks</a>: Considering the previous trope listed, it's only logical that this would be the case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a>: Slightly, when The Ark's <em>Technology Development Rating</em> reaches 30 The People will be on the brink of a technological revolution. This is because the most expensive <em>Ark Projects</em> involve the use of steam powered machinery to make steam powered cars or a fully functional train with a railroad system.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Epilogue of <em>The Gray Death</em> due to the advanced political and militaristic tactics utilized by Proteus and his Army of Dawn, The Dawnworld has forever been changed by their influence. Resulting in more advanced settlements being formed; planting the seeds for the foundation of The Dawn Realms in the many decades to come. With the settlements now being set to begin the stages of exploration and conquest of The Dawnworld under their banners.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague">Sterility Plague</a>: The Mutants can not produce children, but the answer to this infertility lies within Eden and may hold the keys to cure it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkenCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkenCity">Sunken City</a>: It's par for the course when you're playing <em>The Dead Sea</em> supplement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperhumanTrafficking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperhumanTrafficking">Superhuman Trafficking</a>: Despite being slaves; Mutants are still Mutants.

Perfecting her designs for the Omega Mutants, in near fanatic faith to Professor Atwood&#146;s vision. They're hairless Mutants covered in thick scaly skin with sharp claws and fangs, with <em>Mutations</em> like <em>Parasite</em> and <em>Sonar</em>. But they have primitive minds that are comparable to three year old children.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalSensitivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalSensitivity">Supernatural Sensitivity</a>: The <em>Sonar Mutation</em> gives PCs the ability to emit a high frequency sound and listen to its echoes; by doing this they can sense their surroundings and effectively "see" in total darkness for a few minutes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a>: Any child born from one or two non-Human parents, will invariably inherit their physical attributes and potentially their same powers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All Mutants in The Zone qualify as this, as they were all the first iterations of Mutants that would survive in the Zone. Though despite Doctor Retzius' fervent belief of the Alpha Mutants being inferior to her Omega Mutant design; it's likely her Omega Mutants would've never survived The Zone and even if they did, they'd simply be considered a more feral Zone-Ghoul.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague">Synthetic Plague</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unlike the original Red Plague that devastated The Old World, the one that's spreading in Elysium-I is a close recreation. The Red Plague in the <em>Elysium</em> Source Book is transmitted through consumption of contaminated food or through bodily contact with an infected person. This genetically altered version of the Red Plague acts very quickly. Only hours after being infected, the victim begins to exhibit the first symptom &#150; heavily bloodshot eyes, that soon begin to bleed. Fever, chills and severe nausea quickly follow, then hemorrhaging from all body orifices, and finally a painful death. But if the PCs have access to a blood sample from Ephraim Dunkle, they can cultivate an effective antidote. Anyone who is injected with a dose of the antidote automatically recovers.</span></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T to Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>; just as true as the above Society Marches On trope. In the years since the end of the world, technology still advanced past the Modern Stasis of The Old World. Thanks to the preparations and plans of Elysium, Mimir and Noatun. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But also due to the events that have transpired in each of the Core and Source books, as well as <em>The Gray Death</em>, the settlements of The Dawnworld now seem to be on the brink of rediscovering their lost technology.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageWasteland">Teenage Wasteland</a>: Surprisingly, this is actually quite common with the Mutants. As most of the Mutants in the base game are canonically barely out of their teens, with only a few of them being young adults. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later on Players will also discover the same is true for the Zone-Ghouls, who're also entirely comprised of teenagers with only a few adults leading their ranks.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheApunkalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheApunkalypse">The Apunkalypse</a>: This is a core inspiration of the setting, seeing as how some of the artwork depicts mutants wearing quite outlandish outfits. But the Helldrivers' entire aesthetic is basically this, considering they look like they were ripped straight out of a Mad Max film. Wearing spiked leather outfits and multi-coloured Mohawks, they're a gang comprised entirely of grease monkey motor-heads that drive armored cars and roaring motorbikes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">The Clan</a>: Each of the Four Houses in Elysium-I act as large collective families, with nearly everyone in Elysium-I is being related to them in someway or another. Regardless of social standing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>: Once humans journey into The Zone at the end of the <em>Elysium</em> Source Book, a <em>Settlement Project</em> will allow them found a ruling Empire, with an elected Emperor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixStats">The Four Stats</a>: Unlike most other traditional RPGs that would have six stats or above, <em>Mutant: Year Zero</em> has only four <em>Attributes</em> scores and normally fourteen <em>Attribute Points</em>. But to make things more interesting, these four stats act as their own health bars. Which act as your: physical condition, strength and endurance; bodily control, movement and motor skills; mental acuity, intelligence and alertness; and finally your sanity, charisma and emotional readability. Also unlike most games; depending on the race of a PC these stats and scores would be different depending on whether they're a Mutant/Human, Animal or Robot. These different <em>Attributes</em> would nearly act the same as they would normally to each other, with a few exceptions; such as Animal Mutants being able to <em>Dominate</em> over other Animals but not with Mutants, Humans or Robots.<ul><li> The Mutants' and Humans' Attributes:<ul><li> Strength</li><li> Agility</li><li> Wits</li><li> Empathy</li></ul></li><li> The Animals' Attributes:<ul><li> Strength</li><li> Agility</li><li> Wits</li><li> Instinct</li></ul></li><li> The Robots' Attributes:<ul><li> Servos</li><li> Stability</li><li> Processor</li><li> Network</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks">The Morlocks</a>: Some groups of Mutants have degenerated into wild feral creatures due to the loss of their Arks and have been forced to take refuge underground, in tunnels and shelters. Over the years, the Morlocks have lost all connection to whatever piece of civilization they once had. Communicateing with only simple grunts and snarls. They are weary of strangers and will attack if threatend, but can be friendly if treated well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch">The Patriarch</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Mutants of <em>The Other Ark Special Zone</em> are ruled by a despotic Zone-Ghoul referred to only as The Chairman; who rules over them as a King due to his one gift to them, his ability to father children with female Mutants.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">The Plague</a>: The Red Plague was the catalyst that led to the end of the globalized world of <em>Year Zero</em>. It was so named after the first symptom of the disease, bloodshot eyes, that soon started to bleed profusely. At that point, a painful and morbid death would follow the next day. No one knows where the plague originated from, though some speculate it was created by Professor Jeremiah Atwood as a retaliation for the defunding of his original Project Eden. He did not deny any of these accusations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromisedLand">The Promised Land</a>: This is what the Mutants believe Eden to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">Thicker Than Water</a>: Family is an important part of the setting and this results in many figures doing anything and everything for the ones they cherish. So much so that even the Judicators of Elysium-I are encouraged to conspire against other PCs should they be aligned to a different House then theirs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>: Played with, each session is meant to take place over a certain length of time in the setting. As the idea is meant to keep the game flowing at a consistent pace which make sense for the stories being told.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedAccent">Unexplained Accent</a>: A couple of random encounters will have the Mutant PCs encounter strange individuals from mysterious and distant lands, with accents which are foreign to most who settle in The Ark.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity">Underwater City</a>: This is the setting of the second Source Book <em>Mechatron</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">Universal Ammunition</a>: For the sake of simplicity, all conventional firearms have ammunition that can use any caliber they require. There are no descriptions or distinctions of what ammunition can be found or used by PCs. Otherwise however; Energy Weapons use portable batteries, <em>E-packs</em>, whilst Gyrojet Weapons use small and expensive rockets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalSystem">Universal System</a>: Unlike most traditional Tabletop RPGs that use a collection of differently shaped dice for multiple and specific purposes; <em>Mutant: Year Zero</em> uses a simple D6 system with fifteen dice in three colours to distinguish their purpose. The <em>Base</em> Dice is yellow and the <em>Skill</em> dice is green, both sharing the same symbols, with the a biohazard symbol replacing the one and the six replaced with a ionizing radiation symbol; the <em>Gear</em> dice is black with the one being replaced by an explosives symbol. The <em>Base</em> Dice act as the PCs <em>Attribute</em> score, the <em>Skill</em> dice act the same as the <em>Base</em> for the <em>Skill</em> being used, and the <em>Gear</em> dice are additional bonus dice from certain equipment. These dice are then rolled for their dependent actions with however many dice that is available to the player, along with any bonus dice granted by the equipment bonus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">Uplifted Animal</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Played with, it's initially assumed that the Mutant Animals were Animals that were given human traits. This is not so. The Mutant Animals are perfected human-animal hybrids, to be used as an alternate means of surviving and repopulating the surface world. But still act like animals and use a primitive animal hierarchy.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">Vampiric Draining</a>: The <em>Parasite Mutation</em> also allows you to steal any one <em>Attribute</em> point from a victim that the player can heal upon their PC, this can also be used inversely on others as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's all but confirmed that an overarching government controlled the world for a few years, somewhere just before <em>Year Zero</em>'s timeline started to diverge from ours, until the apocalypse came and destroyed it with The Red Plague. This government was formed as part of globalization efforts by the current World Powers, which explains the stagnation that The Elysium Project sought to correct. The Elysium Project was founded in secret by a cabal from a select few of the world's under powered elites, as precaution for the inevitable collapse of The World's government. Mimir and Noatun were founded at some point after as well in response to Elysium. These three groups are the last known remnants of the formally Globalized World.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastelandElder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastelandElder">Wasteland Elder</a>: The Elder of The Ark fits this trope to a T, at least when he appears to his children but he's not the only one; many of the first generations of Mutants that were sent to the surface are far older than the Players' PCs. And many have taken up the roles as Tribal Leaders, Oracles or even Mutant versions of The Elder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">Weakened by the Light</a>: Zone-Ghouls absolutely abhor the sunlight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>: This is a frequent threat that can plague any Player group's Ark, as it often means that a lot of The Ark's time and resources are wasted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdCurrency">Weird Currency</a>: As sated above, the game uses multiple forms of weird currency. From bullets to food, to batteries to just box standard credits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">When Trees Attack</a>: There are experimental Killer Trees that are found out in The Zone, which as stated before can occupy an entire Zone Sector if not eliminated as soon as possible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In <em>The Gray Death</em> Supplement, players get to see the vast extent of their danger if left unchecked. Seeing as how one Killer Tree was able to take over an entire research facility, spread its influence and seed pods all over The Zone and then manipulate the supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the campaign without the need of its own pisonic powers to do so.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a>: A random <em>Mutation</em> gives PCs insectoid wings which they can either use to jump a hundred feet in the air, close the distance between enemies or drive people mad with the intense, loud and unnerving buzzing noise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearZero">Year Zero</a>: It's there in the title; this is because it's meant to represent the earliest history of the world after the end.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">Your Days Are Numbered</a>: Each time a player's character has received a <em>Temporary Rot Point</em>, they must role a dice for every <em>Point</em> to see if The Rot vanishes or becomes permanent. If they role a one on any of their dice, then one <em>Rot Point</em> becomes permanent. These <em>Permanent Rot Points</em> are then stacked onto future <em>Temporary Rot Point</em> roles. Once a character gets ten <em>Permanent Rot Points</em> they die.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld">Zeppelins from Another World</a>: This is how <em>The Gray Death</em> Supplement introduces its new faction, they've also got Airships but they're far more advanced versions of a player's Airship that are piloted by a new enemy called Dawnsoldiers.</li></ul></div><hr>
