Started a campaign set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Equestria</a>, with rules based on Savage World (although he decides to ignore or simplify rules he finds too bothersome), and with the players taking the roles of the Mane 6 + Spike. Mostly plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">warrior/knight-type</a> characters, but can hold his own with priests and engineers.</li><li> <strong>Quiv':</strong> A friend of Dinomax with quite a bit of social ineptitude and/or jerkassness who also doesn't take Tabletop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, whether he's GMing or playing, as seriously as the rest of the group, which is the source of a few conflicts with the more experienced members whenever his casual approach leads him to completely ignore or go against rules that a "good GM" is supposed to know, whether he actually doesn't know them or opts not to follow them because he doesn't like them and/or thinks they're detrimental to his own experience. GMs the <em>Arcturus Chase</em>, <em>Xeno Equestria</em>, <em>AA</em> and <em>S.P.A.A.A.C.E.</em> campaigns, as well as a bunch of spin-off chapters all revolving around the same made-up and loose ruleset. Mostly plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">mage-type</a> characters when he gets the chance.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Sombrax (Started as main, but left the group):</strong> Technically the one to start the whole group by inviting the core members sans Jay to a game of Sombre, which most notably encouraged Quiv' to start Game Mastering himself. GMs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/LeDonjonDeNaheulbeuk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/LeDonjonDeNaheulbeuk">Naheulbeuk</a> campaign as well as individual Sombre games, and is the target of many complaints because of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">tedious</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">aimless</a> his quests are. Tends to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoonie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoonie">weird</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">kinda unhelpful</a> character in the other campaigns.</li><li> <strong>Jay:</strong> Probably the craziest member of the team, but his campaign, though short-lived, was surprisingly well-organised and serious so far. Tends to play very odd characters when given the chance and to make reckless and ridiculous choices that have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">surprising tendency to work</a> and impact the plot in unexpected and creative ways.</li><li> <strong>Ouplas:</strong> The youngest member of the team. Holds another Naheulbeuk campaign, although much more accessible than Sombrax's, was preparing a Palladium one, but shifted towards Ryuutama instead. Doesn't seem to have a specific personal archetype so far. Also has a tendency to complain about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom">the lack of liberty or impact on the story</a> in others's games, even though he also claims he just wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">go with the flow without having to waste time exploring</a>.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Sleeva:</strong> A friend of the team who's been continuously invited to the sessions since pretty much the very start, but only started to find time for it recently. Sometimes causes a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PronounTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PronounTrouble">Pronoun Trouble</a> due to being genderfluid.</li><li> <strong>Yashn:</strong> A friend of Sleeva who joined the games late and usually goes with the flow.</li><li> <strong>Yakah:</strong> A friend of Jay who doesn't really seem to understand rules of follow the plot very well, but still tries to go with the flow and even plans on GMing his own campaign despite his lack of experience and understanding. A bit like Quiv' did, actually, but given his lack of attention and comprehensive skills during game sessions, other players have reasons to worry.</li><li> <strong>Brush:</strong> A recent addition to the team who was considered for a time but couldn't join because there were already too much players to handle. Finally got in when Jay and Ouplas started becoming less available.</li><li> <strong>Casimir:</strong> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, literally in Quiv's campaign, and a friend of Sombrax.</li><li> <strong>Darky:</strong> Jay's Ex boyfriend, came to replace Casimir during his absence.</li><li> <strong>Beni, Dyriad, Jean Eustache and Chloe:</strong> Other friends of the team and very irregular players.</li></ul><p>The team somewhat disbanded as Quiv' decided to focus purely on GMing his own campaigns, aside from Yakah who continues to play with the former member as well as Quiv's campaigns.</p><p></p><hr><h2> <em>Team Space Hobos RPG</em> provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>: Arcturus in Quiv's campaign. He doesn't put himself anywhere on the good/evil scale, and only does things that are considered evil, such as using dark magic and necromancy, as well as planning on killing lots of people; because they're necessary steps for what he's actually trying to achieve. He wouldn't do any of that if he could avoid it, and hates heroes that get in his way and accuse him of being "evil".<ul><li> Xeno Twilight as well, who understands her mass genocide is considered "evil" by the survivors, but since she considers she made the world better by getting rid everyone who presented a risk of holding progress and evolution back, she did that more for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a> than for any kind of evil, petty or personal reasons. Especially since her genocide spell potentially wiped people she actually cared for, but she believes that if they were unfit for her utopia as well, their sacrifice was necessary as well; friendship, love and family be damned.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: Xeno Equestria's setting, which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> version of Equestria where Twilight betrayed Celestia, took control of the country and caused a magic cataclysm that killed everyone who was too weak and/or stupid across the planet, only leaving whoever has the potential to evolve beyond their species's current state. Of course, that means less than a fifth of the planet's population is still alive, and everything is rotting away, except in Equestria istself, where the ambient magic energy is creating new ecosystems.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: Twilight in Dino's campaign, who's taken a liking for Zap Apple Cider, at least according to how Quiv' plays her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: Sylas Stellmare and Sargas Stellmare in <em>Arcturus Chase</em>. Archibald Aardappel in <em>AA</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>: In Quiv's campaign, both Evil Twilight and Sombrax's character come from an alternate Equestria. His second campaign actually takes place in that universe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>: Arcturus isn't commiting acts of evil and cruelty for revenge, conquest or anything, but because he sees them as necessary steps for his true goals, which are closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a> than anything else. Dude just wants to make an experiment and discover something very important to him, even if it means annihilating everything else. It doesn't help that his <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityWithoutYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityWithoutYouth">Immortality Without Youth</a> has had a negative effect on his mind for almost a thousand years, which ultimately made him solely focused on his experiment while forgetting pretty much everything else he could've strived for, gradually turning him into a monomaniac <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who forgot the reasons for his own actions and can't stop doing what he does because it's the only thing left in his mind.<dl><dd><ul><li> Kind of subverted when he comes back as the fourth campaign's final boss, where he seems to have regained some of his sanity and acts more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a>, and is also somehow <em>more</em> insane than when he was actually out of his mind.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Xeno Twilight has always been trying to make the world better with knowledge and magic, but since her world's version of Equestria was an obstructive dictatorship and the other countries weren't much better, she ultimately snapped and used a spell to kill everyone on the planet save for the ones who could actually be useful in creating a new, constantly progressing utopia from scratch. Instead, much of the survivors rebelled against her, trying to get revenge for the destruction of their old world and further delaying Twilight's utopia, making her lose faith in what she thought was the key for progress. In the end, she still managed to find a few survivors who shared her point of view and started creating an actually functional, if small, utopia with them, while the rest of the surviving world kept fighting for what they lost even though in her eyes, it was a necessary sacrifice, and she doesn't understand why people are still held back by the old world order even after it's destruction.</li><li> Barrel Bottom was basically a poor schmuck whose life utterly sucked, what with being constantly ridiculed by everyone because of his dwarfism, his coworkers and his boss constantly abusing him in addition of his boring and underpayed job, his unloving wife and insufferable (unwanted) children making his family life hell... And then he got abducted by Arcturus and made into a guinea pig for his horrible experiences. When he got freed from his predicament by the heroes, noticed he retained most of the dark powers Arcturus' experiments gave him, and gained a powerful magical artifact on top of everything else, he decided he had enough power to get a long-awaited revenge on pretty much everything at once...</li><li> Horizon can be seen as one, since he was originally the king of his kingdom/world/universe that got wiped out and replaced by the one where the campaigns take place, and his many attempts at destroying the current universe is so he can rebuild his own. The spirits that fight alongside the heroes are the same race as him and are essentially turning against their own master/king/god, but are also denying themselves the chance of getting their old world back and instead are protecting the new one, its inhabitants wanting to keep living in it just as much as Horizon wants his world back. The latter isn't really trying to destroy the universe out of being evil, but because he only wants something back.The fact that he is able and willing to kill an immeasurabble number of innocents to do so technically makes him a villain, but as far as his motives go, he was more of a mix of neutrality and selfishness.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: The main point of <em>Sombre</em>, a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role-Playing Game</a> Sombrax GMs sometimes. Characters can very easily die of either physical injuries or insanity, as their life/sanity points go down <em>fast</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>: There is only one "Space Hobo" in all the characters present across the four campaigns, it's Sombrax's character from Quiv's game, Sombrax often claims he's not actually a hobo, and he didn't come from space in the first place. He became the Space Hobo as well as one of the first of many ridiculous elements of the campaigns when he decided to go on a random space adventure with Jay's character at the end of the first quest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: Quiv's space scenarios were originally bonus/side missions for his first campaign, but it's now evolved into an actual full-fledged campaign. The fourth one to be precise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfPower">A Taste of Power</a>: Player characters in <em>AA</em> start off with little to no magical abilities, but are of course expected to develop immense magic potential. Maxwell, one of the ally NPCs, is set to be an example of what kind of things they can accomplish if they get strong enough, and they even get a temporary boost during a boss fight so they can fight on the same level as him.

For example: Arcturus' mind was weakened and unstable enough for Horizon to control him directly, Xeno Twilight wasn't controlled in any way but Horizon somehow contacted her through someone else and made her discover the Purge spell, and Terzial in the fourth campaign wasn't even supposed to exist, but Horizon's growing power allowed it to break some of reality's fundamental rules in order to create Terzial despite its sheer impossibility as a lifeform.</li><li> Arcturus (<em>both</em> versions of him) are also revealed to have been working alongside with Horizon almost from the beginning, and are apparently the brains to his brawn, especially Xeno Arcturus, who was the mastermind behind everything while the original Arcturus is more of an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a> who is as intelligent and scheming as his Xeno counterpart, but again, is mostly insane.</li><li> Alkali the Draconequus in Dinomax's campaign, who unlike most Draconequus, doesn't really create chaos, but instead <em>erases</em> things out of existence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Big Creepy-Crawlies</a>: The first boss in Quiv's very first campaign was a gigantic, insecto&iuml;d and/or crustacean monster.<ul><li> The Stamangra race in Quiv's fourth campaign are a race of sentient, human-sized insecto&iuml;d beings.

They aren't visible by the PCs themselves, but some other major NPCs can sense their presence, as well as Horizon's, a much more powerful and malevolent entity that indirectly manipulates reality, which the other entities are apparently trying to stop by taking control of random heroes wherever and whenever Horizon is up to something. They're ultimately revealed to having been Horizon's subordinates and relatives in their universe, but are now turning against their king and protecting the current universe, which Horizon is trying to destroy to rebuild his own world.<ul><li> Aries Stellmare, Jay's character from the first campaign, comes back during the last few missions leading to the final battle against Horizon, revealing he's been studying him, as well as the spirits, and has been trying to find a way to fight him.

For example, one of the villains owns and uses all three of the magic artifacts that appeared in the first campaign, where they seemed to have no connection with each other. The villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">obviously dies at some point and his artifacts are scattered all over the world</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a>: The Player Characters in Quiv's fifth campaign are the same ones as from the fourth one, but they have to adapt to the new universe they're exploring, which means they have to become Kamen Riders, and do so by basically becoming rip-offs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">palette swaps</a> of already existing Riders, but have to use different weapons, powers and forms than the official ones.

Also, most of the regular players frequently complain about the large amounts of in-game battles instead of exploration and storytelling, but at the same time, have a tendency to run into battle as soon as bad guys appear, or keep trying to find secrets where there aren't any, ultimately making themselves too noticeable and alerting enemies. Finally, most of them seem to think that his campaigns are completely fixed and nothing they do has any impact on the events of the story, when they actually do, which makes Quiv' constantly change or extend his storylines behind their backs because of their actions during the games, but he's apparently being too sneaky about it since the players still believe everything that happens is part of what was planned from the beginning.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">Continue Your Mission, Dammit!</a>: Quiv' had a lot of trouble convincing the players to actually try and fight the bad guy, because the way he explained his true intentions to them was so vague and confusing they were considering <em>joining his side</em>.

Videogame/Starbound characters were also available but weren't picked by the players. A character in the first main campaign is also both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Sunbro</a> and a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEldersScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEldersScrollsVSkyrim">Dragonborn</a>.

As in the whole entire franchise, potentially from Showa to Neo-Heisei.

The players had a lot of trouble defeating them and finding where they were coming from, which turned out to be a magic barbecue grill. The players were normally supposed to defeat the sorcerer using the grill and then interact with it themselves for the quest to continue, but Quiv's character Boris just ran up to it and smashed it to pieces right away, figuring it was the source of all their troubles. The quest technically ended at that point, just not in the way Sombrax intended.<ul><li> In Dinomax's campaign, Quiv, Sleeva and Yashn (respectively playing Twilight Sparkle, Rarity and Fluttershy) used their various persuasion skills to almost completely avoid every single fight Dinomax wanted to put in their way during an entire chapter, in contrast with the previous one where they had to fight pretty much from start to end.</li><li> In Quiv's fourth campaign, when the team's ship was being attacked by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Gravity Master</a> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBoss">Hopeless Boss</a> that was preventing them from taking off, they simply decided to fire a drill rocket. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">The kind that is used to destroy full squads of ships</a>.

At worst, people subjected to great amounts of it are no worse for wear than if they smoke a little bit of weed, and actually gain boosts from it since, again, it's more of a form of partially-magic energy than actual drugs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>: There is a surprising amount of those in Ouplas' campaign, including Quiv's character <em>boiling a lizardman's balls</em> with a spell.<ul><li> In Quiv's campaign, Sombrax's character got killed by Ouplas by way of <em>critical poisoned needle</em> straight into his crotch.</li><li> In Quiv's third campaign, Jay's character got kicked in the nuts by a female NPC who he called a bitch.

The team even considered helping the villain in Quiv's campaign both because they didn't care about anything and the villains intentions were pretty vague and confusing. Even when he clarified that his plans involved killing off pretty much everyone on Equestria, the team of heroes still didn't seem to care about the stakes that much, especially Jay's character who claims he's not from Equestria in the first place and isn't concerned with what happens there. They're still technically the only characters standing in the way of the bad guys and fight them anyway because Quiv' throws tons of railroading and justifications at them whenever they're stepping too close to stopping the story dead in its tracks because of their antics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>: Epsilon quickly shaped up to be one after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn">returning Dinomax's lightning spears back to him</a> twice in a row with seemingly no effort. The team opted to run away from him, but "defeated" him by stealing the item he was guarding before getting out of his room.<ul><li> Most of the villains are supposed to be this in Xeno Equestria, but since Quiv' doesn't like the idea of permanently killing player character, he somewhat nerfed his own bad guys, which actually made the players able to go toe to toe against them with very low chances of dying. Since it makes the players more eager to attack the bad guys right on instead of exploring, which is something some players would like to be able to do more, Quiv' is trying to make his bad guys <em>really</em> hopeless so that the players will actually try to avoid them and be able to explore like they were asking to.</li><li> Karmaxon in Quiv's fourth campaign seemed like that, but an anti-spaceship rocket combined with a magic boost from a powerful NPC made quick work of him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanCannonball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanCannonball">Human Cannonball</a>: Jay's character as well as half a dozen of non-fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> decided it was the best way to get to the <em>AA</em> Tower's top floor during a crisis, and all got shot across the sky in a row by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesAsMuchSenseInContext">giant, drug-powered cannon</a> just to get to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekick</a>: The team in Quiv's fourth campaign have <em>two</em>. The first one is Wat-Wat, Sleeva's familiar, who can do a lot of things that would not be expected from a sheep and/or a Pok&eacute;mon, like detecting bad guys, firing with a turret or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesMoreSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesMoreSenseInContext">turning himself into a table</a>.

The team members got separated from each other at the start and were supposed to get back together, but instead kept <em>running away</em> from each other because they were afraid of everything they saw or heard, even Ouplas's character didn't recognize Dinomax's character walking towards him despite the fact that he was wearing his usual and unique red dragonscale armor and was <em>holding a torch</em>. Quiv' had to throw the dungeon boss right at their faces in order to keep them in one place and stop them from fleeing from their own teammates.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">Immortality</a>: Arcturus was already around a thousand years old and extremely durable in Quiv's first campaign, but he was extending his own lifespan more than anything else and kept himself in a decaying, Deadpool-esque state with self necromancy. The Mask of Kompozyte increased his powers and stabilised his body, but he eventually lost it. He only achieved true immortality when his soul was bound to a mysterious medallion just as he was supposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">truly die</a>. Since then, he keeps the medallion on him at all times, which revives him and regenerates him so fast that even if someone somehow manages to kill him, it would only slow him down for a few <em>seconds</em>, minutes tops. The worse part is that no-one really knows where this artifact came from aside from Dr.Paradox being its original owner, the damn thing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">Made of Indestructium</a> and no-one knows how it actually works, not even Arcturus himself, so there's no way in sight to deactivate it or stop it from affecting Arcturus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink">I Need a Freaking Drink</a>: In Dino's campaign, Quiv', who plays Twilight, made her so incredibly frustrated at pretty much everything around her that she regularly need to chug Zap Apple Cider in order to be able to keep her morale up. It doesn't help that she regularly meditates by connecting her mind to the Harmony Tree and becomes able to see the very planes of magic, which makes the real world even more boring to her when she comes back to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome">Inexplicably Awesome</a>: Wat-wat the Mareep.

He doesn't regret any of the bad things he's done, but he doesn't really act maliciously either. All of his actions are either done towards a very specific goal he's dead-set on and doesn't care about the repercussions as long as he gets what he wants, and the only people he hurts or kills are those who willingly get in his way or whose deaths help him towards his goal in some way.

Technically, it's not exactly the same character, and the original is still dead.<ul><li> And now the replacement fell into a time paradox and officially disappeared from space, time and everyone's memory.

It then turns out that she was created in a Shocker lab and escaped before being completed, so not only did she not remember where she came from, she doesn't actually have any memories before that point.</li><li> Fayde in Quiv's fourth campaign, who sees a lot of things that remind her of her forgotten past, but she can't pinpoint what it is exactly, so she follows the heroes in the hopes that she'll find more clues about her own past.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>: All characters potentially have one in Quiv's campaigns.<ul><li> All the characters in Dino's campaign have several ones, that they can use one time-per-chapter each, can be used at any time, and most of the time don't even require rolling the dice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a>: Mage-type characters tend to have a bunch of spells very early in Jay's and the two Naheulbeuk campaigns. Quiv's half-elf mage in Jay's campaign had learned a good dozen of spells from a few different schools of magic after the first town while all the other players just had their own weapons and stats to use them, and a few blueprints and craft materials in the case of Dinomax's engineer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Living Shadow</a>: Epsilon, one of the many creatures held inside Arcturus' mansion, and the actual boss of the area.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue">Living Statue</a>: Cortexis of the Pyramids in Quiv's campaign, a giant sandstone golem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">giant stone swords</a> who was guarding the throne room in the pyramid.

His titular space hobo spent an entire fight against Tayek skipping his turns by staying as far from the fight as possible, even though he claims that his character's main ability is support. His character in Jay's campaign has the highest determination score, which makes him the de facto leader of the team, and therefore the one who speaks first to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a>; but tends to either offend them or ask inane questions.

He is constantly transporting bones of dozens of different creatures, and his most prized item is a salamander's <em>penis</em>.</li><li> Sleeva is quickly picking up the pace in this department when Jay isn't around. For starters, he was the first player in Quiv's fourth campaign to get himself a familiar, except it's even more absurd than Jay's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingSkull">Living Skull</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>: Three so far in Quiv's campaign: The Sword of Mathusalem, The Torch of Importance, and the Kompozyte Mask.

A few other NPCs help him give some more exposition, but he started it and had the biggest amount of information of them all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster">Multi-Melee Master</a>: Blade Hunter, an NPC, sometimes mini-boss character from Quiv's campaign, uses a wide array of swords, axes, halberds, shields and other weapons in battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiRangedMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiRangedMaster">Multi-Ranged Master</a>: Jay's character in Xeno Equestria has a wide arsenal of firearms on his person at all times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a>: Troll flavor in Sombrax's case. His Space Hobo character in Quiv's campaign did <em>absolutely nothing</em> during an entire quest, staying out of every fight and not using his support skills, which Sombrax himself keeps claiming are his forte. And in Jay's campaign, he keeps a higher Determination score than everyone elso just so he can be the leader and talk to NPCs first... and proceeds to ask irrelevant questions or make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a> comments that often leads to the team getting doors slammed in their faces.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">Mysterious Waif</a>: Fayde in Quiv's fourth campaign.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>: Xeno Equestria is doomed to fail as a campaign because the heroes are trying to fight the "villains" <em>too much</em>, as in, sure, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> caused a worldwide mass genocide, but is trying to create a new, better world with the good elements that survived.

And she's clearly out of the heroes' league battle-wise, even without counting her many subordinates. So basically, she can decide she's done with the old world and just go away <em>at any given time</em> with no-one being able to actually defeat her. Also, the Prowlers, invisible creatures created during the genocide that have a tendency to destroy those who are unfit but somehow survived, are ordered by the villain not to destroy everything until she goes away. And since the heroes are gradually making the villain lose her patience and faith in what's left of the world by pointlessly going after her when she's trying to be merciful and convince them to go with her, they are ultimately pushing themselves closer to being left alone on a dying planet with invisible giants trying to crush them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">Nostalgia Level</a>: In Quiv's fourth campaign, the heroes, and by extension the players, get a chance to visit the same version of Equestria where Quiv's first campaign took place, and only a couple years passed between the events and when the heroes get there.

But he mostly wants to take part in the story and give his characters a life of their own.</li><li> Ouplas is a mix of a Roleplayer and a Munchkin, since his experience in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a> make him interested in, well, actual role-playing; but it also makes him hard to impress and he will try to break the GMs rules whenever he sees an opening, mainly because he wants to teach the others how to avoid making mistakes, but ends up punishing less experienced players and GMs for things they didn't account for and were so minor they could've been left alone.</li><li> Sombrax is mostly a Munchkin, in about the same way as Ouplas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviousPlayerCharacterCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviousPlayerCharacterCameo">Previous Player-Character Cameo</a>: Announcing the quickly approaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade">Continuity Cavalcade</a>, Jay's character from Quiv's very first campaign appears as a major NPC during the fourth campaign, and basically explains the connections between the four different campaigns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a>: The Terzial race seems to use this, since the unknown metal their ships are made of seems to <em>breathe</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a>: Hon, who is mentionned a few times by Jay and Sombrax's one-shot characters as being their mentor.

This leads to a clash of styles when they try to invoke rules when playing Quiv's games, which have <em>no rules</em>, mostly because he doesn't know any and doesn't bother to learn them since so far, they always seemed boring and obstructive to him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Mainly because of Ouplas and Sombrax's many complaints and attemps at forcing him to follow them</a>.

In-universe, Regis didn't want to work with his current team anymore, and out-universe, Quiv' was fed up with playing a mage in Sombrax's campaign, where he was required to make up incantations on the spot everytime he wanted to cast a spell, while Ouplas doesn't ask for that.<ul><li> At the beginning of the last chapter of Quiv's first campaign, Sombrax decided to just quit because for the whole campaign, he didn't manage to do what he wanted to do with his character because of Quiv's way of mastering his game. <em>What</em> he was trying to do exactly is another story and was never clear to begin with, on top of his character constantly infuriating Quiv' because of how useless he was both in story and during fights, which made him even more hostile towards anything atypical Sombrax tried to do, which led him to just walk out before the ending. Again, without anyone, especially Quiv'; understanding why.</li><li> Quiv' himself does that during Dino's campaign, where the difference between his standards and methods compared to the other players', ends up slowing down the whole campaign by despite trying to rush through the main quest while the other players take more convoluted and morally ambiguous ways. He finally decides to simply abandon the story since his cynical character doesn't have any motivation to save the world or its inhabitants, and disagrees with the other characters' methods to actually work along with them even with a different character.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>:<ul><li> To Skyrim, both with Dinomax's character in Quiv's first campaign, who was a Dragonborn.

He did have to do some serious behind-the-scenes railroading when some players were having too much fun trying to sabotage his campaigns for no reason other than they percieved him as an unexperienced GM, which he fully admits he is, which is why he focuses more on storytelling and fun than actual rules and roleplaying etiquette in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixStats">The Six Stats</a>: Dino's campaign uses the six different stats for its characters. Quiv's stat system started with four but evolved into six that are a bit different: Strength, Dexterity and Speed are separated (a character can have high dexterity but still be slow, or fast but not very accurate), Magic and Mind as well (a character can be dumb as a brick but still have natural magic powers, or be really smart but have no supernatural powers), and Charisma. Some characters have a seventh stat depending on their race or even a unique one if their character is, well, very unique one: Robots have a Tech stat, which should replace Magic, but somehow magic-using robot are a possibility; Hydrusks have an Instinct stat allowing them to use their increased senses; and Jay's character has a Stupefaction stat. He's such a stoner he has a stat for getting high.</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingDownTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingDownTheSlipperySlope">Slipping Down The Slippery Slope</a>: Rarity (Sleeva) in Dino's campaign.

The first two are in regular Equestria, and the second one in a parallel version of it, but then the third is set in a world similar to the real world, only with magic and more advanced technology, and then the fourth is set in the same world as well, but in the future and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">IN SPACE!</a><ul><li> And then, the fifth campaign is set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a> universe.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClouds">Space Clouds</a>: In <em>S.P.A.A.A.C.E</em>, after their escape from an under-attack space station on-board of barely functional ship; the players accidentally end up in a cloud of cosmic dust created by the explosion of a nearby planet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">Space Police</a>: <em>S.P.A.A.A.C.E.</em> being set in the future of <em>AA</em>, the <em>AA</em> military forces, as well as X-Terra, essentially became a form of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation">Space Station</a>: The Phi Station, on which the players start at the beginning of the <em>S.P.A.A.A.C.E.</em> campaign. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">it quickly gets destroyed by an unknow alien invasion force</a> and the player characters have to escape on board of a malfunctional protoype ship.

And failing mostly because her friends are too busy being useless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>: Quiv's favorite type of character, even though his character in Sombrax's and later Ouplas' campaigns was formerly a farmer, and is relatively strong for his class. But he doesn't actually get to play this role very often since Sombrax's way of handling mages forced Quiv' to switch to a different class.<ul><li> He's finally allowed to properly play one in Dino's campaign, where he plays Twilight Sparkle herself. Naturally, she's got an amazing Magic stat, but can't really fight physically and has the lowest hit points of all the characters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a>: At one point in Sombrax's campaign, the players go to a shaman in order to help Jay's character with his were-mole curse. The shaman tells them to go find the mole who bit him in the first place, the players do so but don't get any relevant information and find themselves in a dead-end. After a lot of stupid antics due to the lack of directions, Sombrax finally told the players they were supposed to go back to the shaman because he had the cure from the beginning, but simply <em>forgot</em> that he did when the players went to talk to him the first time. Cue massive but justified groaning and complaining from the rest of the players.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>: Dinomax's character in Sombrax's campaign is a priest who can summon... sausages. But since Boris has a deep hatred of sausages after a quest that involved them, summoning them when he's nearby shows risks of making him go berserk.<ul><li> Quiv's character in Jay's campaign has the first two summoning spells of the game, which allow him to summon either a swarm of bugs... or an <em>ORC</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>: The heroes in Quiv's campaign gained a form of this during their fight against Horizon. Dinomax's character fused with Blade Hunter and became able to wield the Sword of Mathusalem without any drawback, Ouplas's character finally got the chance to use the Molestia Stinger and was boosted by its power, Jay's character fused with his giant skeleton familiar, and Casimir's character got an upgraded version of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, which is already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> in itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: The Prince in Dino's campaign, who protected Fluttershy from a giant flail attack and got crushed under it in her place.

Somehow, Jay's character himself exists because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">sent a Dudru in the past, who became his ancestor</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamKiller">Team Killer</a>: Ouplas' character Youun kills Sombrax's hobo by attacking him out of spite, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">accidentally scoring a critical</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers">The Last of These Is Not Like the Others</a>: Among the characters that Quiv' pre-made for his campaign in case players didn't want to create their own characters, are a few variations of the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">heroic-fantasy classes</a>... and a space-pony with an anti-gravity jetpack and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun">Ray Gun</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a>: Tends to happen a lot in Quiv's campaigns.<ul><li> Horizon is technically this for all four campaigns, being the evil entity that's been manipulating events from the shadows every time.</li><li> Xeno Arcturus was the true villain in the second campaign, what with being in league with Horizon and having manipulated Xeno Twilight to make her seem like the actual villain. She was technically a villain too, but she became one because of the very guy who pretended to be the leader of the good guys rebelling against her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> in Quiv's campaign was killed by a gigantic space anomaly caused by Jay's character, which made a lot of overly massive objects such as boats and <em>entire dungeons</em> drop on top of him as he was already weakened. If that didn't kill him, the random time paradox that made everything disappear afterwards surely erased him from reality.<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Gravity Master</a> is lifting tanks and preventing the players's spacehip from taking off?

All that because Jay randomly imagined him having a hidden robotic nature.<ul><li> Quiv actually seems to find this very interesting and fun, given the many stupid things that the players suggest to him, and his tendency to actually make them happen on the fly and if the dice rolls allow them (and they do surprisingly often), like a Mareep appearing out of nowhere just because Sleeva mentioned it, and letting him tame the Mareep, turning it into a major team member despite his improptu appearance being nothing more than a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowawayGag">Throwaway Gag</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Tome of Eldritch Lore</a>: Arcturus's books, which can be used to summon the most powerful and evil beings from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>.

The setting in <em>AA</em> is very similar to what the real world would be in a couple dozen of years, with more advanced technology, science and medicine than today, but not to the point of having flying cars or teleporters quite yet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Military-grade, superpower-granting battle suits</a> are a thing though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Ultimate Evil</a>: Horizon. It's never directly seen, but it's the source of most of the trouble in every single of Quiv's campaigns, as it somehow influences reality and is manipulating the villains in various ways to make them do its bidding while making them believe they're still following their own plans. However, some characters are aware of it's influence, like Xeno Twilight...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">Uplifted Animal</a>: Depending on the player, characters in Quiv's first two campaigns, set in Equestria; are either this or downright anthropomorphic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a>: Quiv's most recent campaigns are set in futuristic settings and even <em>in space</em>, but magic is still widely present and used throughout the universe, mostly as an energy source, but it can be used in the usual spellcasting ways, or even like Bending.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>: Sure, everyone considers Xeno Twilight an insane mass-murderer, but she only did what equates to a worldwide, instantaneous natural selection spell, leaving only whoever would be able to take part in creating a better world from scratch. The other Mane 6 happened to survive, but she used that spell without hesitation even when fully aware that her friends could potentially be killed by it, since if they were not fit to begin with, their deaths would be a good thing, no matter how close they were to her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: It's not a video-game, obviously, but at one point in Sombrax's quest, the players came across an obese man stuck in a well. The players were already tired of going through tedious fights with and had absolutely no idea what their quest was supposed to be due to the general cryptic and unhelpful attitude of the NPCs (and by extension the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GM">GM</a>), so they spent an incredible amount of time just throwing random junk at the fat man instead of doing what they were "supposed" to be doing, but couldn't care less about at that point.<ul><li> In Dino's campaign, the players sans Quiv' somehow decided to run with this trope and managed to create a split in the plot, one with the good characters, where only Quiv' (as Twilight) remains, helped by temporary allies, and one with the characters who turned evil, which is pretty much <em>everyone else</em>. While Twilight is trying to stick with the original plan of gathering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">the Goddess' Pencils</a>, the rest of the original team, led by Rarity (Sleeva) decided it would be a better idea to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>, eventually team up with <em>all</em> the villains and murder everyone else in cold blood.

The other players try to use the trop against him for his meddling, but he doesn't take any of it since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">they were the ones to deliberately derail the original plot and split it in two in the first place, laughing all the way</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: Rarity (Sleeva) in Dino's campaign joined King Sombra both to survive and to get more power in order to save the world...
