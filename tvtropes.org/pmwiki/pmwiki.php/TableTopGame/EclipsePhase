Despite the ecopocalypse and social upheavals on Earth, humanity had conquered the solar system and partially terraformed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mars">Mars</a>. Advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science transformed our lives. Everyone was wirelessly networked with the world around them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> processed vast amounts of information, and nano-fabrication enables people to print complex devices on the molecular level at home. Biotechnology allowed people to genefix, enhance, and clone their bodies, while others pursued body modifications to adapt to new environments or make themselves into something no longer quite human. People's minds and memories could be digitized, uploaded, transferred over long distances, and downloaded into new bodies (biological or synthetic). Death had been defeated... for those who can afford it.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>From within, disaster struck. Transhumanity reaped the rewards of its arrogance when conflict spiked between the battered nations of Earth, already weakened by decades of climate catastrophes and other disruptive factors. Rampant netwars soon exploded into physical conflicts with spiraling body counts. In the midst of these aggressions, a group of military <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> known as TITANs quietly achieved full sentience and autonomy, and rapidly began exponentially incrementing their own intellectual growth. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> spawned by this hard-takeoff singularity quickly turned against transhumanity, enveloping the system in unprecedented levels of violence, disaster, and warfare. What began as a whirlwind of conflict between political factions, revolutionaries, and hypercorps soon escalated into a struggle between man and machine.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In just a few years, transhumanity was nearly wiped out with nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, destructive nanoswarms, infowar attacks, mass uploads, and other unexplained singularity events, ripping the superpowers of old to pieces. Our planetary home&shy;&shy;&#151;Earth&#151;was transformed into a toxic and strange hellhole, while many major habitats were left frozen sarcophagi in the vacuum of space. Just as quickly as they came, the TITANs disappeared, taking millions of uploaded minds with them, leaving behind a network of wormhole gateways. Known as Pandora Gates, these poorly-understood devices allow instantaneous teleportation to distant star systems... often one-way and/or fatal. Though only a handful of Pandora Gates are known to exist&#151;each highly contested&#151;the foolish, brave, curious, and desperate are already risking certain death to enter and explore what lies beyond.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Fall, transhumanity lives on, divided into a patchwork of hypercorp combines, survivalist stations, transhuman faction species, and city-state habitats. Under the oppressive police states of immortal inner-system oligarchies, advanced technologies remain highly restricted, and refugee infomorphs are held in virtual slavery or re-sleeved in robotic bodies and forced into indentured labor. In the outer system, rebel transhuman scientists and techno-anarchists struggle to maintain a new society-from each according to their imagination and to each according to their need. On the fringes, in obscure crevices of the system, lurk networked tribes of political extremists, religious fanatics, criminal entrepreneurs, and bizarre posthumans - among other, stranger, and more alien things...</p><p>Though most claim the Fall was carefully orchestrated by the out-of-control TITANs, others whisper that the driving powers behind the wars&#151;both AI and transhuman&#151;were infected by a mutating virus with multiple infection vectors&#151;biological, information, nano&#151;dubbed the Exsurgent virus. Whatever its source, this virus has been known to sometimes transform its victims into something unexplainable... something monstrous and reality-altering. Whatever the truth, the remnants of the TITANs and this virus were left to the desolated ruins or driven to the edges of the system, where they remain hidden away in dark corners, quietly waiting to infect the minds of the scavengers and explorers who find them...</p><p>This game is brought to you by Posthuman Studios.

However, their given name comes from the that they claim to be the self-appointed representatives of other species out there, though they are not giving out any details, and the fact they can be very deceptive when they choose to be, just opens up more questions than putting this fully into doubt.

They had disappeared from the surface of their home world about a million years ago rather suddenly after the discovery of the Droplet gate. Very little remains of them, so it's hard to tell how advanced they became, but they appear to have achieved a level of technology similar to Transhumanity but for space travel. More concerning, another building/construct called the Toadstool exists on Droplet, having been made of a highly advanced, hardened, and self-repairing material, and it appears to predate the Amphibs themselves by a long time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: 10 years after, to be exact.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I.

The Earth was completely decimated 10 years before the start of the setting, leaving killsats, nanobot swarms and head-hunting bugs to greet anyone who is brave (or stupid, or flat-out insane) enough to go back. About 10% of humanity were off world or managed to evacuate before the TITANs simply disappeared. Many think they went underground for their own purposes, or started infighting and stopped the violence when they realized they were evenly matched and started a long cold war. The consensus of those in the know is that they may have built their own Pandora Gate and left, leaving their weapons and minions behind.</li><li> A school of thought among some ecologists and old "nationalists" want to reclaim Earth, though doing so would be impossible in transhumanity's current state, and the fear of the possibility of reawakening the Titans would effectively split the system if it were tried.</li><li> That all said, humanity isn't completely off Earth. There are still secret expeditions that bypass the killsats and infiltrate down to the surface for incredibly valuable pre-Fall relics, or other clandestine operations. There are confirmed settlements of subverted transhumans and exsurgents who oddly don't live in peace, and rumored settlements of surviving humans residing in the remote parts of the world, or underwater or underground, and rumors of entire vaults of survivors in cold storage.

Androgyny and hermaphrodism are options in both cases. Note that <em>gender</em> identity tends to be less mutable, and that people generally identify as male, female, or neuter regardless of what sexual organs they're wearing at the moment. Pleasure pods are made to be as mutable as quickly and easily as possible, for sexual purposes, though the fluff states some brinkers use them to encourage gender identity fluidity. Gender identity can also be flipped, either reversed or turned on an off, by psychosurgery. This takes longer than swapping bodies, but not by that much (a week or two versus a day or two). If you want to start messing around with forks, it's even easier than that, and that's before you get into things like using an XP to temporarily experience another mental identity, borrowing memories with psionics, the impersonation skill (which temporarily reshapes all your mental autonomic reactions), etc. Basically, there's almost no physical or mental aspect of 'identity' that can't be altered completely with a bit of elbow grease and some gear rolls.

Jovian tech (and, in general, tech made without nanotech or 3D-printers) are an aversion - being made deliberately without nanites and nanoengineering, they tend to be big and clunky, but work just fine - and don't require high-tech manufacturing or nanites that may be scarce, hijacked, or TITAN-infected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs">Everything's Better with Dinosaurs</a>:<ul><li> The Opteryx morph resembles a archeopteryx (hence the name) or some of the smaller dromeosaurs.

What the TITANs hoped to discover is unknown, and it's unclear if the experiment was successful or if it was abaondoned before completion, since the experiment and society were abandoned and left to its own devices.</li><li> Egonapping and Forknapping are known criminal hot spots for the outfits that are unscrupulous even by criminal standards. The Nine Lives and ID Crew cartels are some of the best known practitioners, and all it takes is an intercepted egocast or even darknet egocasting with somebody you can't fully trust. The egos that are captured are forked and sold off as slaves, sometimes pruned or psychosurgically altered to better fit a client's needs. This practice has earned these outfits a special place of hatred from the rest of transhumanity.</li><li> No less scrupulous but much more merciful, some organizations like high-security concerns or even Firewall will make a fork for a simulspace interview to get a better grasp of somebody before letting them into a habitat or organization. Most security organizations will conduct an interview and then delete the fork, allowing the main person to continue about their business without concern of complications. Firewall, as a matter of ruthless pragmatism, will occaisionally forknap a potential recruit and conduct a battery of tests to see how well they react to simulated field situations or hold up to stresses or interrogations.

Anything that can't be nanofabbed or requires more resources than a person is allotted (services, implants, spaceships, earth relics...) are either bartered for or obtained as favors from one's social network, which assign "rep" scores to people based on their actions.

They use really heavy anti-nanotech defenses, but everything else they use is analog and often mechanical rather than electric - the morphs they use for anti-TITAN ops don't even have mesh implants. The reason for this is because they've learned from hard, lethal experience that TITAN viruses can and will subvert any computer that they find and turn it into a nest of metallic tentacles; the best possible defense against that is to give the TITANs nothing to infect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">Sanity Meter</a>: Your Lucidity score functions like mental hit points.

Firewall thanks its lucky stars that as soon as things don't go its way or it thinks it's going to win, subtlety goes out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a> come in.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">Virtual Ghost</a>: Infomorphs, particularly the infugees who escaped the Fall as backups.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualSidekick">Virtual Sidekick</a>: Most characters have a semi-sapient AI called a "Muse" in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface">Brain&#150;Computer Interface</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>:<ul><li> The Autonomist Alliance is composed of every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism">anarcho-subgenre</a> around the sun, and not all of them get along. In particular, the Extropian anarcho-capitalists and the collectivists barely even agree that they're on the same side (with the mutualists sitting in a Switzerland position between them), and the scum have no use for anyone's laws but their own and embrace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnarchyIsChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnarchyIsChaos">Anarchy Is Chaos</a> on their own barges; conversely, Titanians and anarchists generally get along better, acting more like bickering siblings than true rivals.</li><li> The Barsoomian Movement agrees on one thing: Martians should decide their own destiny, and be governed by their own people rather than by the Planetary Consortium. Beyond that, they have nothing in common, ranging from the nomadic techno-libertarians to the "redneck" clanking masses in low-quality robot shells, and each group has a different vision for the future. Supporting the Barsoomian Movement is one of the few things that almost everyone in the Autonomist Alliance agrees on, but conversely, not all (or even most) Barsoomians are autonomists; some just want a new Martian government, an end to indentured servitude and a chance for economic success.</li><li> Firewall's decentralized and compartmentalized nature can lead to many conflicts between different Servers (Super-cells), made worse by the fact that Firewall was founded by the various anti-x-threat agencies/organizations with different ideas on how to combat said x-threats, from which came five major ideological factions:<ul><li> The Backups, who believe that the Second Fall is not only possible, but is inevitable, and so try to make sure that transhumanity can survive it by establishing more exo-colonies and building Arcships. Everybody else thinks that they leech resources from more immediate concerns, but on the other hand, they tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamSwitzerland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamSwitzerland">Team Switzerland</a> in internal disputes, and the rest of Firewall appreciates the resources that their research brings to the table. They also have the distinction of being the "original" ideology of Firewall, based in pre-Fall existential threat organizations.</li><li> The Conservatives, who believe that the only appropriate response to anything that is a potential x-threat to transhumanity is to destroy it, and that includes any kind of AI, including the AGIs. Many view them as overly paranoid, xenophobic and racist, but they have the most means to supply and finance Firewall agents, giving them substantial influence. These used to be the dominant faction early after the Fall, but an incident where a trigger-happy group of agents destroyed a ship with thousands of infugees on board because the captain happened to be an AGI kicked them out of their defacto leadership, which was snatched by...</li><li> The Pragmatists, who believe that you need fire to fight fire, and that includes the use of TITAN tech. They are also in favor of not killing Asyncs, AGIs, and Uplifts, which granted them a reputation of inclusiveness. Some, mainly the Conservatives, believe that they place Firewall at risk of infection and subversion.</li><li> The Structuralists, who believe that the ad-hoc, decentralized nature of Firewall hinders it more that it helps, and push for a more established, structured hierarchy in order to more efficiently respond to x-threats. They also believe that Firewall should go public and work with similar agencies across the solar system. Everybody else thinks that this will result in Firewall being subverted by governments or other competing powers.</li><li> The Mavericks, who are comprised of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> types who believe in Firewall's cause but don't like the strict regulations and procedures that Firewall operates with. Due to Firewall being decentralized, servers that predominantly trend Maverick have a reputation for abandoning all but the most basic operational structures and for being at risk of leaving Firewall entirely. The rest of the factions consider the Mavericks to be more of a problem than a legitimate faction, and want to keep them limited so they won't expose the organization as a whole.</li><li> Minor Firewall factions include Anti-Capitalists (hypercapitalism is the most pertinent threat to transhumanity's survival), Aggressive Reclaimers (perform an all-out strike on Earth and the Exhuman enclaves), Capsulists (lock all of transhumanity away in ego vaults, complete the singularity in simspace, and emerge as gods in a few million years), Mindcrafters (create a super-intelligent AI and do it right this time), and Negatists (destroy the Pandora Gates at all costs).</li></ul></li><li> Firewall also has to deal with external politics butting into the x-risk calculation. Firewall has proxies of nearly all ideologies <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4fvz1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4fvz1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4fvz1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ultimates have, so far, never made proxy</span>, and some proxies define other ideologies as literal x-risks in their own right; most notably, autonomists that argue that hypercapitalism is an x-risk. Some proxies want to try to get everyone playing by the same rulebook, but the consensus is that trying to force servers to leave outside politics at the door would risk a schism.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture">We Will Use Manual Labor in the Future</a>: Averted in the strictest sense, as most labor is done by robots.
