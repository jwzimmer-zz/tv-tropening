Players field teams of Humans, Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, etc. and roll dice to decide the outcome of passes, tackles, and dodges.</p><p>In its initial inception, the game engine was closely based on that for <em>Warhammer Fantasy Battle</em>, and the background was consistent with the established <em>Warhammer</em> setting. However, the rules tended to bog the game down in a series of mid-pitch fights and the 1994 re-release of the game reinvented the rules to produce a more free-flowing game, as well as starting to take the game in a different, lighter tonal direction: in an alternate <em>Warhammer</em> world, warring armies found that their battlefield hid an ancient temple to the god Nuffle, whose worshippers in the land of Amorica practiced a brutal but highly entertaining combat ritual called Football. The troops decided to give it a try, and soon they developed their own version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Nuffle's Amorican Football</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The pawns in the game are referred to as "players". Consequently, to avoid confusion, the real people who own the players are referred to as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigiousPlayerTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigiousPlayerTitle">"coaches"</a>.</p><p>Each team moves one player at a time, and if any player fails an action, then a turnover is called, and their entire team's turn is ended &mdash; this means that coaches quickly learn to prioritise actions and get very good at working out the best sequence of events to affect dice multipliers. That said, once a player is moved, the previous acting player will be inactive for the rest of the turn, forcing coaches to take risk quite frequently. This nature of the game is lampshaded by the named-in-the-fluff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a>, Great God of Dice "Nuffle" (a pun on the NFL), as entire games can turn on a single failed dice-roll. Experienced coaches sometimes refer to a spectacularly unlikely yet gravely devastating failed roll as being "Nuffled".</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>League play is encouraged, with players earning "star player points" for successful actions, which can lead to advances after the game at certain levels. Most commonly, players acquire extra skills, but can also end up with stat increases or, in the case of Chaos and Skaven players, mutations. Fans also come and go with the success of a team, and some dice-rolls during a game can be affected by how many fans have turned up (not to mention affecting the gate takings, and therefore the winnings generated). A handicap system ensures that weaker teams are given advantages to "even the odds" a little &mdash; this has been overhauled in the Living Rule Book and now includes temporary hire of Star Players, the ability to Bribe The Ref, numerous different Random Event/Special Item cards, and the like.</p><p>Originally released in 1986, <em>Blood Bowl</em> proved highly popular and went through a number of editions until it was discontinued, along with the rest of the <em>Specialist Games</em> range, in the early 2000&#146;s. In November 2015, it was announced that the <em>Specialist Games</em> division was to be resurrected, with <em>Blood Bowl</em> being the first game released (on 25th November 2016) due to its continued popularity. A 6th Edition, titled Blood Bowl: Second Season Edition, was released in November 2020 and saw the rules being revamped and streamlined far more than in previous editions.</p><p>There was a comic adaptation released by BOOM! Studios in 2008, and a series of novels by Matt Forbeck. There also exists an old, 1990s DOS-age game, rudimentary as far as graphics go, but highly entertaining due to multiplayer requiring only one computer. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bloodbowl-game.com/">A second video game adaptation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was released in 2009, developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CyanideStudio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CyanideStudio">Cyanide Studio</a>. <em>Blood Bowl 2</em> was released on September 22, 2015. The release of the 5th Edition of the game in 2016 resulted in the rerelease of the novel series in eBook format and has seen the release of a number of eShort stories.</p><hr><h2>The game and setting provide examples of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAthlete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAthlete">Accidental Athlete</a>:<ul><li> The Dark Elf Star Player Horkon Heartripper was once an infamous assassin hired by the Ashbane Vendettas to kill an opposition blitzer. Unable to take out the player before the game, Horkon launched his attack during the game itself and ended up taking out half his target's team and accidentally scored a touchdown in the process. Such talent was immediately in high demand and the Vendettas hired the assassin in the spot.</li><li> Anqi Panqi, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Saurus</a> Star Player introduced during 5th Edition, was the Temple Guard bodyguard of Xlu&#146;hotex, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrogMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrogMen">Slann</a> Head Coach of the Tlaxtlan Stegadons. This all changed when he took to the pitch in order to protect his master from a Pitch Invasion where, in the confusion, Anqi somehow managed to score a touchdown that gave the Stegadons a chance of winning the match. Finding he enjoyed life on the pitch far more than guarding crumbling ruins, Anqi embraced his new role as a player with an eagerness unusual for a Saurus.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: Griff Oberwald, Star Blitzer and captain of the Reikland Reavers, is said to be the most talented human to ever pick up a Blood Bowl ball with a plethora of awards, good looks and a massive fan following. Griff&#146;s game rules represent this by giving him the best overall stats and skills of any human player but at the cost of him being the second most expensive individual Star Player in the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>: Several teams have "keystone" players they pretty much need in order to handle the ball or use their primary strategy, and having these players leave the pitch is more or less a guarantee that you can't score any more. Lizardmen skinks are a good example, as are dwarf runners and vampire thralls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a>: While some races have a small number of female players and/or Star Players, the Amazons are the only team to be made up exclusively of female players, recruiting their members from the all-female human tribes of the Lustrian jungles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnouncerChatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnouncerChatter">Announcer Chatter</a>: The background material for the game often includes numerous humorous excerpts from the various Cabalvision sports announcers, most often from Jim Johnson the Vampire and Bob Bifford the Ogre but other announcers have been included in some material. The Cyanide Studio Video Games include Jim and Bob commentating on events during the game as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: In their background information, the Athelorn Avengers, the most famous Wood Elf team to ever play the game, have considered the Darkside Cowboys, the most famous Dark Elf team, to be their greatest enemies since their first match against them resulted in more than half the Avengers starting roster suffering career ending injuries and the rest suffering from years of psychological trauma. The fans of the two teams in particular seem to have taken this animosity to heart with augments between the two groups often resulting in violence that surpasses the game itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a>:<ul><li> The Claw mutation treats all armour over 7 as 7 when blocking players down (a knocked-down player must roll a number less or equal to his armour on 2d6 or risk injury, so Claw ensures a ~42% chance of armour break). This makes it a killer against highly armoured teams like chaos, dwarves, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">chaos dwarves</a>, but near worthless against low-armour teams like wood elves, amazons, and skaven.</li><li> The chainsaw (wielded by certain star players and the goblin loonie) adds a +3 to armour break rolls, making it superior to the Claw for anything with an armour lower than 10. The disadvantages are that the chainsaw is illegal and will be taken off-field at the end of a drive, and because it is a special attack and not a block, it will either pierce armour or do bugger all (as opposed to a block, which knocks players down for a turn even if they succeed at the armour roll). It also has a 1 in 6 chance of backfiring on the wielder.</li><li> Gang-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">fouling</a> adds a +1 to armour breaking per participant after the first one. A full eight-member pile on is all but guaranteed to break armour.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: The AI in the video game is infamous for this, to the point that veterans routinely warn new players to avoid playing any practice matches against the computer... copying its tactics is a sure-fire way to finding yourself on the receiving end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>, and even learning how to exploit its flaws won't help against human players, few of which would ever make such glaring errors. The only two reasons that the AI ever wins matches against human players are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Nuffle</a> and the fact that the AI <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">doesn't play fair</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:<ul><li> Most Big Guys are considered this. They're good at bashing and tough as nails, but it takes some effort to use them in circumstances other than blocking. These brutes are slow, clumsy, and commonly have a debuff that occasionally forfeits their moves, even losing their tackle zone. They are also expensive, and thus many coaches shy away from hiring them to avoid inflating Team Value.</li><li> Several of the Star Players are this as well, especially Morg 'n' Thorg (who comes at a whopping 430K for a single player). Their stats and skills are better than anything your players can develop into, but a lot of the time, you may be better off with a cheap mercenary and some other inducements like a wizard and an extra apothecary.</li><li> Vampires have one of the best stat lines of any non-specialist player in the game (starting with a 4 in strength AND agility as well as an above-average 8 armour), regeneration, can hypnotise enemy players, and to top it all off, can select skills from almost any discipline. Unfortunately, they also suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmBloodBagsAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmBloodBagsAreEverywhere">Blood Lust</a>, meaning that for <em>every action they try to take</em>, they have a 1 in 6 chance of either latching onto one of their nearby Thrall teammates and draining him (knocking him out of the game) or running off the field to attack a spectator (causing the action to fail, ending your turn, and moving the Vampire to the Reserves box). Additionally, Thralls themselves aren't very spectacular players.</li><li> Ogre teams can field up to six ogres. Six <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">OGRES!</a></em> Only the Khemri can even <em>approach</em> that kind of muscle! Unfortunately, while they don't have Loner like ogres on other teams do, they still suffer from Bonehead, making them painfully unreliable, they still don't get General skill access (meaning you need a doubles roll to give them even something as basic as Block), and their only other players are Snotlings, who are... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">weak</a>.</li><li> Almost all the players on the Khorne teams start with Frenzy. This ability allows you to block again if you got a "enemy pushed" result. While it does increase players' chances to get defender down results, it also increases chances of getting attacker down results, causing turnovers. Frenzy also forces the player to follow anyone they punch, possibly putting them out of position. Additionally, having the Frenzy skill means a player cannot take the Grab ability (they are mutually exclusive).</li><li> Chaos Pact can hire three Big Guys, a mutated dark elf to do ball handling, and their marauder linemen have <em>incredible</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> potential with their skill access. However, three Big Guys means three chances of going stupid each round (and unlike ogre teams, they aren't guaranteed to make the reroll), and the whole team has animosity.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a>: Turning opposition players into toads and frogs is a fan-favourite tradition for Hireling Sports-Wizards and one that has been present in a number of editions either as a spell or as a special play card.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellyMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellyMouth">Belly Mouth</a>: The Nurgle Star Player Guffle Pusmaw has been blessed with the mutation of a large mouth situated on his swollen paunch. Guffle has since learned how to use this drooling maw to receive a pass far better than he could when using his hands, becoming the most successful Nurgle Catcher in the history of the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>: The 5th Edition Wood Elf Spite Star Player Swiftvine Glimershard is said to get extremely irate if she even thinks someone has called her something such as adorable, small, delightful or fey. Using such insults in the presence of the shot tempered sprite can cause serious repercussions, as one Underworld Denizens team discovered when they were mysteriously slaughtered in their own locker room after a match.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">The Berserker</a>: Players with the Frenzy skill throw two blocks in a row (stopping only if they or the opponent is downed) and will always follow-up.

They tend to have good armour, the Mighty Blow trait (or alternately Claw in some Big Guys), lousy agility, subpar movement, the Loner trait, and some other drawback (Bonehead, Really Stupid, or Wild Animal), and lack of access to General Skills: Big Guys can knock your opponents' linemen senseless and little else. However, if a Big Guy somehow gets hold of the ball, it will be... quite difficult for the opposition to strip it away. The Ogre team is half made up of these players. Two specific subversions are Undead Mummies and Khemri Tomb Guardians. Both have strength 5 and limited numbers, and beginning players may think of them as Big Guys. However, they are not considered to be Big Guys, specifically because they do not have any major drawbacks (beyond low mobility and lack of general skills &mdash; and for Tomb Guardians, they have the Decayed trait and replace Mighty Blow with Regeneration) and therefore no reason not to take them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>: Mix satire of Football hooliganism with the worst stereotypes of Rugby and American football (and <em>their</em> supporters) and add to the already quite darkly comedic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>-verse.

These traps can range from simple tripwires hidden in the turf to more esoteric, magical traps such as a concealed Rune of Unwilling Flight. In-game, various editions have represented these traps with various Dirty Trick Special Play Cards that can be used by a coach during the game to hinder opposition players.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoozeBasedBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoozeBasedBuff">Booze-Based Buff</a>:<ul><li> Heady Brew, an Inducement that can be purchased by 5th Edition Halfling and Ogre teams, is a potent ale brewed by the Halflings of the Moot that can drive even the most placid Stunty to violence.

Take a player with the ball. Put one player in each diagonal corner around him. Run that formation to the opponent's end zone.

But they can go toe-to-toe with practically everything except high-level Chaos players and come out on top, and their (already very slow) cages described above are almost impossible to slow down (further).

They are replaceable with journeymen if they die, and usually cost as much to replace as an average match result. Elves and dwarves (whose players are really expensive) avert this, and the Lizardmen and Chaos Dwarves invert it as their 0-16 players are the only ones with a snowball's chance in Lustria of actually handling the ball with any rate of success.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a>: The Evil Gits team in the fluff.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a>: Injuries that lower stats and increase the chances of getting more and/or worse injuries.

In every actual aspect of the game, they are incompetent. However, they have the most secret weapons that have no use beyond wreaking as much havoc as possible before the referee throws them out. In addition, the Goblin team pays less to bribe the referee than any other team, allowing them to cheat without consequence more often.</li><li> In the fluff, the Skavenblight Scramblers are the only team to ever win the Blood Bowl twice in a row. The first time, they did this through guts, skill, and tenacity (well, as much as you'd expect from the average Blood Bowl team...), whereas the second time, they did it by sending slaves to die by their multitudes while the real team spent the entire season rigging their home stadium with booby traps, pitfalls, and other horrible ways to maim their opponents in the final!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a>: Halflings in the fluff.

Face the team with the strategy they lack - if you face a bashy team, play a clever positioning game; if you face a wimpy team, bash their heads in. The obvious weakness of course is everybody is better than you at a certain type of play.</li><li> Orcs: <em>Brute.</em> Orcs are the inventors of Blood Bowl and their teams are some of the most renowned in the league. Their playstyle favours bashing holes in the opposition's defensive line and exploiting those gaps with their excellent Blitzers. They are strong and well-armoured but relatively slow, and their ball handling skills could use some work. Overall a team for people who believe best defence is a good offence.</li><li> Dwarfs: <em>Elitist Brute.</em> Dwarfs would seem like the perfect Blood Bowl players - compact, tough and stubborn. They refuse to die or give up and this suits defensive play really well. Their blocking ability is extraordinary and any Dwarf who gets knocked down will be back up to fight again later. As you might expect their short legs make them terrible runners, barely as fast as the slowest members of other teams, so smart positioning is incredibly important when playing Dwarfs.</li><li> High Elves: <em>Elitist Ranger.</em> High Elf teams are often comprised of Princes, noble sons and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">Blue Bloods</a>, making them some of the most arrogant and best-outfitted players out there. Their ball handling game is absolutely first-class, they are hard to catch and pin down, and decently well-armoured as well; however they are still slight of frame and easy to injure, and this is a bad thing given the exorbitant rates some of them ask for!</li><li> Dark Elves: <em>Elitist Technical.</em> Dark Elves play quite similarly to their goodly kin, but prefer a more malevolent and direct game that goes through the opposition rather than around them. They are not as fast but they are stronger and able to survive and prevail in clashes that the High Elves could not. Any casualties on the pitch are going to cost the treasury big time, and likely will be the Witch Elves - anyyone familar with Dark Elves know what these ladies are capable of, so they are attractive targets for the other team.</li><li> Skaven: <em>Spammer Guerrilla.</em> They may be wimpy, they may be cowardly, but boy, Skaven are fast! Even the elves struggle to cover the gaps in their lines and prevent a lightning-fast rat touchdown. Skaven can even score a touchdown on the very first turn without giving the other team a chance to do anything, with a bit of luck and skill. Unfortunately their lack of muscle and armour mean any clash will go horribly for the rats and they are likely to be injured or killed. But Skaven life is cheap anyway.</li><li> Chaos: <em>Brute</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. "If all the opposing players are dead then scoring is irrelevant", sums up Chaos' playbook. Games with Chaos more resemble street brawls than ball games, as the horrifying ensemble drive up the centre pitch, maiming any opposition foolish enough to get in the way. Their mutations add new abilities to complement their raw power, but they still lack mobility and diversity; they don't even have dedicated catchers or throwers. Forget the ball and just look for fights!</li><li> Bretonnians: <em>Elitist Generalist.</em> In the fair land of Bretonnia, every knight dreams of the Bloodweiser trophy and they travel far and wide for the chance to one day lift it. With dirt-cheap linemen (incompetent peasants drafted to play with the knights) and excellent Blitzers, Bretonnia is a team that likes brawling. However the team is centred around these players; they need to well-supported or they will be crushed, and if they are crushed then you will lose. Their passing and running game is also impeded by their heavy armour.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>: The rulebook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshades</a> this, pointing out that any world where <em>Blood Bowl</em> is popular must really suck.

Natural scorers then get SPP from touchdowns, gaining extra skills that make them even better at it. Since every skill costs more than the one before it, these players can suck up nearly all their team's touchdown XP with relatively little benefit. Unfortunately, since any player can be hit by permadeath or a crippling injury, especially if they're a fragile scorer, over-relying on that high-level player can become a team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>.

AI vs AI matches being auto-resolved lead to hilarious score results that would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve for a human, and their skill gain is not bound to the same rules humans must obey and leads to teams with an ungodly high frequency of doubles and stat gains, while their number of touchdowns, injuries and MVPs recorded would make it impossible for them to be that high level. One AI team, the Lizardmen Itzi-Bitzi Blockers, seems to exist just to wave this fact in the player's face &mdash; it's a 10-man skink team (with a kroxigor) where <em>all the skinks have block as their first skill</em> (a doubles skill for them). 'Unlikely' doesn't begin to cover it.</li><li> The sequel manages to reign in some of the impossible skill combinations of the first, while managing to turn this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in other ways.

"Really stupid" is "bone-headed" on steroids and has an even greater chance of activating unless you've got a non-stupid player to poke the Big Guy in the leg.

In the PC version of the game, their cheerleaders are masses of writhing flesh, mouths, and tentacles, squeezed into an iron cage which is presumably there to stop them from slithering off and eating the spectators.</li><li> In the sequel, while the human and dwarf cheerleaders are largely the same, the "female orc" cheerleaders have also returned in full force.

The game itself represents this with random chances of riots, pitch invasions and other fan violence happening whenever there is a kick-off. Fans will also beat-up any player pushed into the crowed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a>:<ul><li> The famous Orc Star Player Varag Ghoul-Chewer, captain of the Gouged Eye, has an unusually tactical mind for a greenskin.

He is kind to children, (relatively) nice to his fans, and was used as spokesman for a successful road accident reduction ad campaign. On the pitch... Not so much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>:<ul><li> Dwarf Slayers start with two very good offensive skills (Block + Frenzy) and Dauntless, which allows them to go toe-to-toe with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> of other teams with a little luck. Like all dwarves, they are slow as heck, and have the lowest Armour Value in the dwarf team (which, granted, isn't saying much; the dwarves' <em>lowest</em> AV is 8, equivalent to most other races' linemen and blitzers). They also tend to operate solo a lot and are favourite targets for your opponents. Fluff describes slayers as berzerk warriors with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">death wishes</a>, so it only makes sense.</li><li> Similarly, Wood Elf Wardancers and Dark Elf Witch Elves are very good natural blitzers but are very expensive and very vulnerable to counter-attacks. Wardancers in particular are nightmares; a Wardancer built for taking the ball away will generally only fail to get the ball away if she suffers from poor rolls on the part of her coach (against a target without Sure Hands, a Wardancer with Wrestle and Strip Ball has a 98% chance of knocking the ball loose on a 2-dice block). Wardancers beginning with Block and Dodge is almost enough to elevate them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> status, but, sooner or later, a Wardancer is going to wind up prone, and when she does, a brutal multiple-player game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">Kick Them While They Are Down</a> is sure to follow.</li><li> To the great surprise of most beginning players, Amazon teams actually fall under this. A lot of people mistake them for a running or passing team, but they don't have dedicated runners, their speed is strictly average (6 on all players), and their passers and receivers are pointedly unspectacular compared to most races (they don't get any agility 4 players or any other special advantages). However, Amazon blitzers are one of the few classes in the game to start with Dodge AND Block (the infamous "Blodge" combo), they can have up to 4 on their starting lineup, and all their other players get Dodge, meaning they can get Blodge after their first level-up. Amazons actually play as a bashing team, relying on Block to let them stand up to bigger, tougher teams like Orcs and Chaos, but their armour value of 7 means that they're alarmingly fragile.</li><li> Norse teams are similar to Amazons in this respect, but all of them have Block as their starting skill instead, but still only have 7 armor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoKartingWithBowser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoKartingWithBowser">Go-Karting with Bowser</a>: Granted, everybody is still trying to kill each other, but people are still playing sports with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> factions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">Gradual Grinder</a>: Teams that predominantly feature low Movement/Agility, high Strength/Armour players (such as various flavours of Dwarf, Chaos and Undead team) rely on grinding down and injuring the opposition before simply walking the ball into the End zone to score.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Green Thumb</a>: The Horticulturalists of Nurgle, specialist Wizards available to hire by Chaos Chosen, Chaos Renegade and Nurgle teams, are able to cause the weeds and grass of a Blood Bowl pitch to writhe with life before they rot to nothing.

Unlike the bombs, chainsaws and steamrollers used as secret weapons by other players, these knives are easy to conceal from the gaze of the referee and so their use will not get the player sent off for using them during the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldYourHippogriffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldYourHippogriffs">Hold Your Hippogriffs</a>: The comic has a few, though in this case it's football terms rather than aphorisms that are being adapted.

Barring the attacker having its counter-skills (Wrestle, Tackle, Juggernaut), only one out of every six blocks (Defender Down) will affect them at all, with an equal chance of the attacker rolling an Attacker Down and going down instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood">Impossibly Delicious Food</a>: McMurty's Squig Burgers, which are so tasty and filling that eating one will mellow even the most bloodthirsty of beings. In the sequel video game, installing a McMurty's stand in your stadium <em>calms the fans down</em> to the point that you'll never suffer a Pitch Invasion or Get The Ref! on a kickoff. This is widely speculated to be the reason why signing a sponsorship deal with McMurty's includes a curious little clause that strictly forbids your team from eating there before a game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">In a Single Bound</a>: The Leap skill allows a player to make great jumps over the heads of opposition players.

Human teams thrive at flexibility and taking whatever it is their opponents do poorly at and using that strategy against them.</li><li> Also, although they're technically humans anyway, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazons</a> are even more average than the Humans &mdash; <em>all</em> their players have the same stat line (even their specialists) except for a few starting skills, and they don't have access to any "big guys" like Humans do.</li><li> Vampires are probably the best example of a straight Jack when hired. They have average speed, but hit as hard as any non-big guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> player and are as agile, if not more so, as any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> player. Vampires also have access to most of the skills naturally, though they can only take Passing skills 1/6 of the time. The only skill set they can't get is Mutation, which is specific to Chaos-based teams and the Skaven. They don't start with any skills specific to a particular role, though, so skill selection determines what role they develop into. Due to the high stats, they are still competent blockers, passers, catchers, and runners without the appropriate skills, but not as good at any individual role as most of the more specialized players.</li><li> Thanks to their mutation access, Underworld teams can quickly go from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> to a fairly good Jack team after a few levels.

This makes them rather inept at handling the ball; even the dwarves can do ball handling more reliably than Khemri. However, they can hire 4 strength 5 tomb guardians, more strength than any other team except the ogres, and while tomb guardians can't get block except on doubles, they don't have any Big Guy negative traits. A Khemri team can sail to a close victory over the broken bodies of their opponents, but if their Tomb Guardians go down, the team is practically nothing but (literal) dead weight.</li><li> Underworld consists of a rag-tag collection of the worst players from the skaven and goblin teams, who all suffer from animosity that means their ball handling never reliably crosses the species barrier. However, normal access to mutations and a very varied skill set (they're one of only two teams in the game to have normal access to <em>all</em> the game's skills, spread amongst their characters) means their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> is second to none when it comes to flexibility, even if their players are crap stat-wise.</li><li> The video game sequel introduces the Bretonnion teams.

Most significantly, they're the only Big Guy to actually get their own <em>team.</em></li><li> Beyond the ranks of the Big Guys, Lizardman Saurus are strength 4, move 6, and armor 9, and the team can field 5 of them at once as well as their Kroxigor. Sure, they're only agility 1, but skill them up enough and a Lizardman team can float like a butterfly and sting like a steamroller.</li><li> Chaos Dwarf Bull Centaurs have strength 4, move 6, and armor 9, can sprint, and are sure-footed, which means they can go up to 9 squares every turn barring some very unlucky rolling. They also have agility 2, making them viable (if less-than optimal) ball carriers. You can only field 2 of them, however, and they're expensive as heck.</li><li> As a general role, Blitzers have higher than normal movement and have the Block skill, making them very good right out the gate at hunting down ball carriers, whose specializations tend more toward the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> school.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a>:<ul><li> As in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, the <em>Blood Bowl</em> version of the Lizardmen are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec">Mayincatec</a> servants of the Old One with three main races: the man-sized Saurus that have thick scaled hides, viciously sharp teeth and fangs, muscular tails; the smaller, amphibian Skink that have slick-scaled skin, short tails and crested heads; and the ogre-sized, crocodilian Kroxigor. The Lizardmen are also very important to the historic backstory of <em>Blood Bowl</em> as they were the original race to introduce Nuffle and his sacred game to the world. In-game, the Lizardmen are a traditionally a Tear 1 team with a good mix of fast and tough players.</li><li> The Zoat were a race of nature-loving, centaur-like lizard people from early editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> that were later written out of the background material.

With some exceptions like Hideous Appearance, Tentacles and Claws, etc., many of these mutations aren't quite as potent as more standard skills, but they give otherwise limited players a lot of flexibility (for example, a Beastman is normally a mediocre catcher, as he just has average agility and no Catch skill, but if gains an extra arm, he gets a fairly hefty +1 to catching a thrown ball or picking a loose ball off the ground, and for his agility of 3, that +1 may be better than getting the extra re-roll from the Catch skill that he'll likely just botch again).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">My Species Doth Protest Too Much</a>: The Scarcrag Snivellers are unique amongst Goblin teams as they attempt to win their games fair and square without any trolls, fouling, chainsaws or any other secret weapons.

The Elven Union team, the Celestial Comets, are particularly adept at using these teleporters and when they switched to regular Blood Bowl they brought some with them that they would install on a pitch before a match. The 5th Edition of the game represents this with the Celestial Comets 2489-2490 Hall of Fame Squad that includes special rules allowing their players to make a special Teleport Action to move between the teleporters during a game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrainSculpting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrainSculpting">Terrain Sculpting</a>: The Slann Mage-Priests, hireable by Amazon and Lizardmen teams in 5th Edition as specialist Wizards, are able to use their world altering powers to affect the pitch a game is being played on.

In other words, the race is still in the rulebook, but no supplementary material, models, or mentions of the team exists in any Games Workshop-controlled media. In the second <em>Blood Bowl</em> video game, the Slann team shows up as Kislev Circus, which has the exact same stats and skill access but different models.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">Unnecessary Roughness</a>: This is basically the entire premise of the game, to be honest.

No Big Guys (models with base strength 5 or higher) have normal access to the General skills either, limiting access to the all-important Block. The sole exception is the vampires, who start with both good stats (four strength AND four agility) and a few great abilities (most notably hypnotic gaze) but come with their own issues...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UntouchableUntilTagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UntouchableUntilTagged">Untouchable Until Tagged</a>: Players with the Block and Dodge combos, coupled with high Agility, can weave in and out of tackle zones and easily fend off opponents going for a block attempt.

This means the enemy can't fight back against it, like a regular block attempt would. However, being unmodified means that no positive or negative bonus is applied to the roll. So Dirty Blow and Niggling Injuries don't apply and high AV opponents can easily shrug off a stab attempt. Even worse, because Stabbing isn't a block attempt, if the roll fails to damage an enemy, then there's no possibility of a knockdown. This makes Stabbing only effective against weak opponents like goblins or halflings, and against those, you can simply hammer them with a regular block.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>: Takes every bit of American league and college football (along with rugby) and amps them up.

Turn football into a wargame. Think the NFL's a huge megacorporation that enthralls a nation? Have it as a literal God. No one likes a player? Murder them. Think coaches are really old? Have them as literal zombies. Think certain football stars are prissy, overpaid primadonnas? Have an entire team of them that <em>refuse to play</em>. Hear about the bounty programs NFL teams would illegally use to knock out rival players from a season (or even life)? How about having it a staple of the game, and replace "knock out" with more murder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalKidnapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalKidnapping">Vertical Kidnapping</a>: During the 2459 Lustrian Superleague semi-final match between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen">Queekwell Queasers Skaven</a> team and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Tlanxla Terradons Lizardman team</a>, the great flying lizards that the Lizardman team was named for began grabbing Skaven players from the field and either dumping them into the crowed or taking them back to their nests for a snack.

This highly infectious disease corrupts its victim, body and soul, turning them into hideously mutated and utterly devout followers of the Plague God. Blood Bowl players who contract the Rot will be driven out of their original team to join those that infected them.

However, those two skills and their AV of 9 means they'll stay relevant as roadblocks even into long tournaments, even if (or perhaps exactly <em>because</em>) they hardly ever skill up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a>: One of the more specialised Hireling Wizards available for teams to hire are Weather Mages who are able to use their abilities to alter the weather to a limited degree. The 5th Edition rules for Weather Mages represent this by allowing them to attempt to change the weather effect for a single turn per game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar">Weather of War</a>: Most editions of the game include a table of random weather effects, generated at the beginning of the game, that can cause players may collapse in sweltering heat or find the ball too slippery to handle in snowy conditions. The 5th Edition of the game introduces a number of extra weather and environmental effects for the various race specific and additional playing field boards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">We Can Rebuild Him</a>: The 5th Edition (In)Famous Coaching Staff character Krot Shockwhisker is a Skaven Engineer who excels in combining flesh with technology and hires out his services to Blood Bowl teams to finance his experiments. During a game Krot can attempt to fix a seriously injured player so that they can take to the field once more. Given the nature of Skaven technology however there are often complications.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>:<ul><li> Skaven coaches, due to their race's cheap linemen, and tendency to get turned into a pulpy mess, often end up with this mindset.</li><li> Undead, Necomantic, and Khemri coaches due to their players' ability to recover from serious injuries.</li><li> Snotlings and Halflings are the cheapest and second-cheapest players in the game, and the easiest to kill. Do the math.</li><li> Finally, vampire thralls have very low life expectancy due to low armour value and being preyed on not only by your opponent but your own players. Vampire coaches tend to fill the rosters with them "for safety's sake".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">When Trees Attack</a>: Halfling and Wood Elf teams are both able to hire Treemen, large and ancient beings that take the form of animate trees. Why these supernatural creatures take to the pitch is a matter of debate in the background material, but many pundits believe it is due to their protective nature or, in some cases, the desire to get revenge for the trees killed to build Blood Bowl Stadiums. In all editions of the game, Treemen are slow but incredibly strong and tough, giving those teams they play for some much needed hitting power on the pitch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws">Wolverine Claws</a>: The Wood Elf Spite Star Player Swiftvine Glimmershard is able to grow razor-sharp claws from the ends of her fingers, a skill she is more than willing to use against anyone that she thinks has insulted her. In-game this is represented by Glimmershard having the Stab Skill in the same way as those players who carry knives onto the pitch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>:<ul><li> It is impossible to buy life insurance if you are a coach.</li><li> If you fail one of the obligatory missions in the "legendary edition" story mode, your coach will be abducted and eaten by some ogre fans.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>:<ul><li> The prevailing tactic for Halfling teams in both fluff and actual play &mdash; "After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team's end zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them won't be jelly by the time you throw the thing."</li><li> Back when Snotlings had their own team, each only counted as half a player. This meant they could field twice as many players on the pitch as another team. However, Snotlings are so weak that they deserve to be called half a player.</li><li> Skaven coaches tend to sacrifice their linerats by the dozen by making them block opposing players' pieces so their gutter runners and stormvermin can work unmolested.</li></ul></li></ul><hr>
