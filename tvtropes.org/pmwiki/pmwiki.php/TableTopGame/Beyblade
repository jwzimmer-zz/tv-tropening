<div id="main-article" class="article-content retro-folders">
<p>The anime and manga series are, like many other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> series, a vehicle to advertise toys and other products. Starting in 2000, the series has been around more or less in some form constantly since.</p><p>Inspired by the traditional <em>beigoma</em> tops, and as such the basic premise is the same as the much older toys. Two tops spin together in an enclosed area of some kind, and the last one left spinning is the winner. Other battling top games have existed throughout the world prior to the introduction of <em>Beyblade</em>, but it introduced a novel concept to the game - customization. This allowed for strategic play beyond "try to make your top spin faster."</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The series has gone through several iterations, usually with a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a>. Each version is considered to be part of a unified system, which has on occasion been updated to replace specific parts with others.</p><p></p><ul><li> Plastic Generation (<em>Beyblade 2000</em>, <em>V-Force</em>, <em>G-Revolution</em>; 2000 - 2004)<ul><li> Initial System: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">first system</a> of parts. Notable in that a screwdriver was needed to assemble the Blade Base. Additionally consists of the Attack Ring, Weight Disk, Bit Chip, and Bit Chip Cover. All tops released during this time were right-spinning. Setting a precedent for future lines, only a few Beyblades were made in this system before being upgraded to the next.</li><li> Spin Gear System (SG): The first major update to the line. The Spin Gear was added and the Blade Base no longer needs tools to assemble. The Spin Gear is made up of a plastic shell, a small metal ring, and a piece that depended on the Blade Base's tip. The Bit Chip was also lengthened, so that it wouldn't require a cover. The spin direction of the Beyblade is now determined by which Spin Core is included, but requires separate launchers for each direction.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Magnecore System: Added small magnetic pieces inside the Spin Gear and magnets into the base of the stadiums. This allowed for more dynamic play by having the magnets attract or repel the tops as they moved around the stadium.</li><li> Engine Gear System (EG): Replaces the Spin Gear and Blade Base. The tip has a wind-up motor built in, which will activate during battle. They can do so in a number of ways, including taking enough hits or immediately after landing in the stadium. This allowed the Beyblade to regain speed, which could help it recover but also potentially cause a spin-out.</li><li> Hard Metal System (HMS): The point where the the "Plastic Generation" name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">became less meaningful</a>. Unlike previous updates, this is a completely new system made up of a Running Core (or Running Tip), Weight Disk, Attack Ring (which now contains metal), and the Bit Protector. Some used a Customizable Weight Disk with included a plastic frame, which could either spin freely around the Disk or clip into the notches on the sides. The tops and winder were both designed to allow spin in either direction. Takara Tomy decided to call a hiatus while they reworked the franchise after this point.</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Metal Saga (<em>Metal Fusion</em>, <em>Metal Fury</em>, <em>Metal Masters</em>, <em>Shogun Steel</em> (<em>Zero-G</em> in Japan); 2009 - 2014)<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Metal System (MS): A completely new design, partly inspired by the HMS. Beyblades in this series are made of a Performance Tip, Spin Track (core), Metal Wheel, and held together by a Face Bolt. Tops in this series were only released in Japan and didn't appear in the anime, only the manga.</li><li> Hybrid Wheel System (HWS): Known as the Performance Top System (PTS) in Hasbro regions. Replaces the Metal Wheel of MS with the Fusion Wheel (main point of contact) and the Energy Ring (where the Launcher holds on). Besides this, all of the other parts are carried over from MS and new Spin Tracks and Tips were backwards compatible. Some Energy Layer/Fusion Wheel combinations could behave differently depending on which way the two were stacked, called "modes". Spin direction requires both the Energy Layer AND Fusion Wheel to allow the correct launcher to attach, though some very rare ones allow spin in both directions.</li><li> 4D System: Introduced 4D Wheels and 4D Bottoms. The main focus for the line is mode-change gimmicks. 4D Wheels could either have a single metal wheel which built-in mechanical gimmicks or have multiple parts that were only usable for that particular wheel. Some of the latter may have rotating rings or metal parts that could be flipped upside down; others might simply have a metal wheel with a plastic core that doesn't require an Energy Ring. 4D Bottoms could have automatic mode change, such as having a retracting or extending tip, or manual ones that the player could switch between battles in a match.</li><li> Synchrome System (Zero-G): Sold under the <em>Shogun Steel</em> banner. Replaces the Fusion Wheel and Energy Layer with the metal Warrior Wheel and the plastic Element Wheel. These two pieces can be attached to the Spin Track with either facing upwards, which could have an effect on the performance of the top. Also, the Element Wheel can be replaced with a second Warrior Wheel to make a super-heavy Synchrome Beyblade. The other main change is that the stadiums have round bottoms that allow the whole setup to rock back and forth, hence the series' Japanese name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremelyKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremelyKoolLetterz">eXtreme Top System</a> (XTS): Made up of a few series of non-customizable tops that all had a built-in gimmick.<ul><li> Tornado Battlers: Extra tall Beyblades. Supposedly to make them wobble more during battle.</li><li> Electro Battlers: Built in lights and sounds. The lights can be used to figure out how fast the Beyblade is spinning.</li><li> Stealth Battlers: Built in, spring loaded weapons. Weapons are deployed when a button on the Beyblade is struck in battle.</li><li> IR Spin Control: Uses an infrared remote control to control spin direction and speed. The controller also has battle sounds.</li></ul></li><li> BeyWheelz: a spin-off created to fill the gap between <em>Metal Masters</em> and <em>Shogun Steel</em>. The associated toyline involved rolling two wheels made of multiple interchangeable parts at each other, using ramps to create a mid-air collision. While not as popular as the main toys, it was moderately successful.</li><li> BeyWarriors: uses small monster action figures with gyroscopes built into the base to basically work the same way as regular Beyblades. While the main body was firmly attached to the base and therefore couldn't be changed, the arms of the figures could be swapped. While this was meant to keep the <em>Bey</em> name on the shelves, <em>Shogun Steel</em> sold well enough to continue distribution during most of this period.</li><li> BeyRaiderz: A spin-off of BeyWarriors, each player has a small, ripcord-powered car that moves forward a certain distance before automatically returning. The goal is to hit a target before the other player, knocking a disc off to score a point. Got a second wave under the name <em>BeyWarriors: Cyborg</em>.</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Burst (<em>Burst</em>, <em>Burst Evolution</em> (<em>Burst God</em>), <em>Burst Turbo</em> (<em>Chouzetsu/Cho Z/Super Z</em>), <em>Burst Rise</em> (<em>GT/Gatinko</em>), <em>Burst Surge</em> (<em>Superking</em>); (2015 - Present)<ul><li> Burst System: A three-layer system that uses a Performance Tip (or Driver), (Forge) Disc, and Energy Layer. Made of two layers of polycarbonate, one colored and one clear. The clear layer is the main point of contact between Beyblades.</li><li> Dual Layer System: Uses Energy Layers where both the colored and clear layers are points of contact. Besides allowing for more diverse designs with more contact points, mostly the same in terms of performance.</li><li> God Layer System: AKA SwitchStrike in Hasbro territories. Energy Layers have built-in moving parts, such as spinning rings or spring-loaded points. Forge Discs now include a plastic Disc Frame that can affect the properties of the Bey, such as increasing the number of attack points or making them harder to topple. New Performance Tips with gimmicks similar to those from the 4D System were also introduced.</li><li> Cho-Z Layer System: Energy Layers introduced in this system replace the clear polycarbonate layer with metal instead. Unlike previous <em>Burst</em> systems, there is no Bit Chip-like circle in the center, opting instead to have ornate designs that take up more area. In place of it is a common gimmick of the Energy Layers having a hollow diamond-shaped hole, meant to be filled in by a ring-shaped piece that fits underneath known as a Level Chip that would greatly improve a Bey's performance.<ul><li> SlingShock System (<em>Turbo</em>): Hasbro's release of this system however does not use metal parts, instead continuing to use polycarbonate in place of originally metal parts except in a small number of specific Beyblades. It also replaced many of the mostly typical Tips with variations that can either change height or contact points, allowing them to more easily connect with and grind on Rails on the edges of the Beystadium. These rails are typically oriented in such a way as to speed the Beyblade toward the center of the battle area for heavy clashes.</li></ul></li><li> Gatinko Layer System: Energy Layers are now split into 3 parts: the Gatinko Chip, the Layer Weight, and the Layer Base. Forge Discs with built-in moving parts were also introduced.<ul><li> HyperSphere System (<em>Rise</em>): The Hasbro adaptation of the the Gatinko Layer system, it removes the Layer Weight and replaces it with plastic details molded into the Layer Base. The GT Chip determines the spin direction of the Energy Layer, while the Layer Base determines Attack, Defense, and Stamina. Forge Discs with moving parts were replaced with ones that are compatible with Disc Frames. Unlike Gatinko, new, mostly rounded Hypersphere Tips are used to allow Beyblades to climb the walls of Beystadiums more easily. This allows deeper Beystadiums to be used than before, and also makes it easier to escape Ring-Out Pockets.</li></ul></li><li> Superking Layer System: Energy Layers of this system are split into 3 parts: the Superking Chip, the Ring, and the Chassis. Circular part in the center of the Bey has been reintroduced as the Chip Core, a part considered a part of the Superking Chip. Chassises have 2 variants; the Single Chassis that is compatible with Forge Discs, and the Double Chassis that does not allow Forge Discs to be used, integrating them into the Chassis itself instead. While the Superking Chip in general is compatible with the Gatinko Layer Weights and Bases, some Superking Chips have an additional ring or other features around them edges that prevent them from being backwards compatible. There is also a Sparking Core part that can be used with certain Beyblades, but offer little in the way of tactical advantage.<ul><li> Speed Storm System (<em>Surge</em>): The Hasbro release merges the Chassis and Ring, much like it did with the Layer Base and Layer Weight in <em>Rise</em>. In fact, the Chip and Frame design is mostly the same but changes how the Chip locks into the Base. Instead, the line focuses on new Performance Tips and Beystadium features. Tips are tall like with SwitchStrike but for the most part no longer change modes. Instead, they are meant to interact with "Surge Pockets" in the Beystadium - smaller round bowls on the edges of the larger main one, meant to encourage movement and speed of battling Beyblades. The taller tips also make them compatible with the Rails of SwitchStrike Beystadiums while still able to climb the walls of HyperSphere Beystadiums.</li></ul></li><li> Pro Series: Not a new system <em>per se</em>, but rather unaltered releases of the Japanese versions in Hasbro territories. Due to the relatively high demand from teenage and adult players for the more competition-focused features and gimmicks, this line was introduced to give an option for fans who would prefer not to pay the sometimes ludicrous markup for imports. The first wave included three Cho-Z Beyblades - Cho-Z Achilles, Cho-Z Valkyrie, and Orb Egis, with the metal, grooves, and decals for the Energy Layers included. They also include the Light Launcher, rather than the Starter Launcher that they were released with in Japan. Since Pro Series Beyblades use the Japanese molds, parts compatibility between the main line and Pro Series is the same as between TakaraTomy and Hasbro main line Beyblades. See below for details.</li><li> <em>Beyblade Micros</em>: A tie-in line with ~1 inch wide<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sbwm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0sbwm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sbwm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">about the same size as traditional beigoma</span> tops based on their larger brethren which consist of two parts, an Energy Layer and a Tip. The Tips are specialized like the larger ones but are smaller and more simple. The Energy Layers for the <em>Micros</em> tops can also be attached to the normal <em>Burst</em> Performance Tips to make a narrow but comically tall top. The American release of <em>Micros</em> was sporadic, with most retailers only having them available regionally for a long time. Others seemingly never picked up the brand.</li><li> For the international release of the toyline, Hasbro made a few changes, some of which had a fairly significant impact on performance. Changes made to the toyline as a whole include:<ul><li> No decals were included, instead replacing them either with more basic paint applications or replacing them with different details entirely. SwitchStrike was the first to try to stick closely to the Japanese designs for the "primary" release of a given Layer, which would continue with all subsequent series. Some minor visual differences still occur as a result of limitations in using paint, such as gradients being replaced with solid colors.</li><li> The grooves, or "teeth", on the underside of the connector ring in the middle of the Layer were replaced with a slope ending in a single, shallow groove. Rather than trying to lock the Tip in place and clicking into the next position with a hard enough hit, the slope would change the amount of pressure on the Tip's spring. Under certain circumstances, this design had the advantage of causing the Layer to tighten itself back down. While early Beys sometimes had different performance compared to their Japanese releases as a result of this change, later ones were very similar if not identical.</li><li> The center post on the Performance Tip and the connector ring on the Energy Layer were both lengthened very slightly, making Japanese Drivers unable to connect to Hasbro Layers. While they technically <em>can</em> connect if enough force is used, this slightly distorts the post on the Driver, which can affect how securely it connects with Japanese Layers. As a result, the WBBO fan group banned the use of Japanese and Pro Series tips that were forced onto Hasbro Layers.</li><li> Some Forge Discs, on a case-by-case basis, were altered slightly to have deeper grooves or divots to make them lighter. However, the majority were unaltered and even seemingly use the same exact molds as the TakaraTomy releases.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>The game's mechanics are simple. Each player can have up to three tops available to them. Two players each launch a top into a bowl-shaped battle arena, and the last one left standing is the winner. Winning can either be from knocking your opponent out of the ring (Ring-Out Finish) or making their top stop spinning (Survivor Finish). Each win earns a point, and the first to seven points wins. A Burst Finish, where a Burst Beyblade flies apart when it loses, nets the winner two point. Later <em>Burst</em> tops include instructions for a shorter 3 point match, mirroring the accompanying mobile game's mechanics - players try to score three points before their opponent but are only allowed one Bey. Another variation has the player select up to three tops, selects which order they will be played in, and the winner is whoever gets best of 3. The Battle Tower Stadium set introduces 4-player battles, having a standard 2-player Beystadium on one side and a 4-player one on the other.</p><p>There are 4 basic types of tops: Attack, Defense, Stamina, and Balance. Counter-intuitively, Balance means having bits of the other three types all put together, rather than having a top that's good at balancing on its tip.</p><p></p><ul><li> Attack: Fast and made for hitting. Strong against Stamina, weak against Defense</li><li> Defense: Heavy and hard to move. Strong against Attack, outlasted by Stamina.</li><li> Stamina: Light, with focus on spin time. Good against Defense, but usually knocked out by Attack.</li><li> Balance: Named as such due to being a mix of different types, thus having no weakness, but at the cost of having no specific strength as well. Hard to predict, and varies greatly based on actual parts used.</li></ul><p>Of course, there are exceptions to rules here; all types may be either Mobile or Stationary, and may act more like one of the other types as a result. Despite this, their main type will be evident in their performance.</p><p></p><hr><h2>Tropes specific to the tabletop game are:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: The names of the Hasbro <em>Burst</em> Forge Discs and Performance Tips are not mentioned on the packaging or in the instructions, which just uses their part numbers. However, they <em>are</em> given their proper names in the app/mobile game, viewable while editing a Beyblade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a>:<ul><li> The Hasbro <em>Burst</em> Master Set Launcher still includes the clips to attach multiple launchers together. However, there's no opening for the winder to pass through, so any attached launchers will be basically pointless. And since two String Launchers can't be attached side-by-side, it's not really easy to double launch using two String Launchers. It mainly seems to be there for the carabiner attachment. The same is true of the Dual Threat Launcher, except the Carabiner gets in the way of the mode lock switch.</li><li> The Sword Launcher and its recolor the Apocalypse Blade Launcher similarly have the useless clips on the sides, but also use a different ripcord - though a regular one can be used in a pinch. That said, there's still no openings to allow them to be used at the same time.</li><li> The launchers used in <em>Burst: Speed Storm</em> only include the male connector on the front of the launcher, with a rounded back end and no female connector. This effectively means you can't use the feature without owning older toys. The rerelease of the Super Grip Launcher means it kind of works with that, but also the second launcher will barely get any power since it has much less of the ripcord to work with.</li><li> To a lesser extent, compatibility with Disc Frames in <em>Burst: Rise</em>. No new Disc Frames were introduced, even when multiple Forge Discs were adapted to include compatibility<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1uo77');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1uo77" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1uo77');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">During the Japanese equivalent, <em>Gatinko</em>, there was more emphasis on Forge Discs with non-removable plastic contact points; these were removed in favor of notches to attach Frames when localized</span>. However, <em>no</em> Beyblades during this time were sold with Disc Frames, meaning you'd have to have older Beyblades that did include one to benefit from this change.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:<ul><li> Making the heaviest possible build results in the <em>technically</em> best possible Attack or Defense Bey possible, depending on what tip is used. However, it will most likely launch much slower than a lighter build and not last as long if your opponent doesn't ring out. This is most extreme with Metal Saga Beyblades, since they have a much higher maximum weight than others. That is, if you didn't get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Rev Up Launcher</a>.</li><li> Making the <em>lightest</em> build will result in a Stamina Bey that will launch easily and spin fast, as well as being able to stay away from the low center of the stadium. The downside is that it has no defensive <em>or</em> offensive capability due to its low mass, making it only occasionally effective against one build - the heaviest. Again, this is primarily a Metal Saga issue, since the original and <em>Burst</em> have a narrower range of weights to work with.</li><li> 4D Bottoms, as a general rule, are this. As fun of a concept as Cosmic Pegasus's Final:Drive may seem, you're better off with a Flat <em>or</em> rubber tip, rather than one that switches modes during play. And Diablo Nemesis doesn't really benefit from being stuck with one Spin Track with a 3 position tip when the individual tips are also available. Even though the tips can be switched between rounds in a match (otherwise against the rules), a single tip is still preferable.</li><li> Hasbro <em>Burst</em> launchers can clip end-to-end to launch two Beys at once for solo play or 4-way matches between two players. However, the added weight of a second top more often than not causes a slow start up. It also makes aiming into the stadium harder and more likely to land one or both in a ring-out pocket. Add that on top of the fact that the early Hasbro <em>Burst</em> Launchers have a tendency to slip off one side, it might take several attempts to get one successful launch.</li><li> Several Performance Tips in <em>Burst</em> and its sublines. Variable and its update Evolution are at their peak either mint or when their first set of spikes break, and become mostly unusable when their second set give out. This also means to a collector who also plays, they risk <em>damaging their toys.</em> Beyond that, much like with Metal Saga, Performance Tips that have three choices that can be changed between rounds in a match are less practical than any of the individual Tips they copy. At least they allow whatever Forge Disc the player wants now, compared to <em>Metal</em> where it replaced both the Tip <em>and</em> Spin Track, severely limiting what could be done with it. Reboot and Ultimate Reboot have the same issue Final:Drive did in <em>Metal Masters</em>, though Reboot doesn't use rubber which makes it somewhat more reliable.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops">Battle Tops</a>: The basic premise, obviously. The last one standing is the winner.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>:<ul><li> For Metal Saga, the most effective and utilitarian tips are the more simple ones (Sharp, Wide, Ball, Flat, etc.) compared to the more gimmicky ones (Quake, Right/Left Flat).</li><li> Among gimmicked parts, the less complicated ones are also the ones that tend to perform best. In Metal Saga, Rubber and Metal variations of basic tips tend to be more effective more reliable that those that can be flipped or rotated to change their battle properties - many have a tendency to move out of position during battle, or have their locking mechanisms break over time.</li><li> The very premise of the game itself can count, compared to many other toys that have come and gone. The very foundation of Beyblade is based on the very simple concept of spinning tops, a toy that can be traced back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">millennia</a></em>. Nothing overly fancy or 'futuristic' compared to many other toys out there, yet it was this simple premise that likely it gave it staying power when compared to other 'fad' toys like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Bakugan">Bakugan</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleBDaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleBDaman">Battle B-Daman</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLfsRi8DMFE">This video goes into it in more detail<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>:<ul><li> In every series to date, a tier list has been available from day-one and updated frequently. A large part of the metagame is buying specific parts (or the set they're released in) second-hand, mainly from eBay where they can go for as much as $100 US for rare or high-demand tops and launchers. Part of this was due to the extreme levels of scalping involved.</li><li> Better launchers, grips, and other accessories are often what determines a match. The person with the string launcher is pretty much guaranteed to win, if both players don't have one. The short-run Rev Up launcher (Only released in the US and Hong Kong during the Metal Saga) is one of the most expensive items on eBay due to it being both incredibly rare as well as the absolute best launcher for Metal Saga and Shogun Steel Beys.</li><li> In the plastic era the customized 10bBistool was practically invincible, especially in tournament play. Winning basically boiled down to if you had the money to get one, again second-hand because they did not stay on the shelf for long.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion">Combinatorial Explosion</a>: Even through the design of a given era of Beyblades is basically self-contained, just within each generation the number of possible combinations is insanely high. This tends to only jump in orders of magnitude as time goes on, as certain part types will be broken down into more parts. For example, the Japanese version of <em>Burst</em> went from 3 parts to at least 5 but as many as 7, depending on specific parts<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wtw4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2wtw4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wtw4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later Forge Discs have an optional Disc Frame, while the Energy Layer was reworked <em>twice</em> to have three separate parts, with the second time also giving a swapable Core to specific Beyblades</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>: Of a sort. Both the Metal Saga and <em>Burst</em> are designed in a way to combine elements of both the Spin Gear System and the Hard Metal System (both from the original series), but in different ways.<ul><li> The Metal Saga uses a "Spin Track" that all other parts are attached to similar to how the Spin Gear was the central connector but with the metal upper wheel and screw-on top piece of the Hard Metal System.</li><li> The Burst System has the tip as the piece that the central part with a metal ring fitting around it like the Hard Metal System, but with the Energy Layer twisting into it in much the same way as the Attack Ring did with the Spin Gear. The Gatinko and Superking Systems also added a Chip in the center, in much the same way as the Bit Chip of the Spin Gear System though also making it the part the holds the whole thing together similar to the Bit Protector of the Hard Metal System.</li><li> The ripcord for the left-launching L-Drago series in Metal Saga all had a dragon-shaped grip, just like Tyson had for Dragoon's various forms.</li><li> <em>Zero-G</em>, the Japanese version of <em>Shogun Steel</em>, had the assembly tools built into the launcher just like the Hard Metal System's launcher had the tool for the Bit Protector on the end of one of its ripcord slots.</li><li> <em>Shogun Steel</em> included Beys based on the original series, including one called Dragoon. The others - Garudas, Genbull, and Byakko - instead have names based on their original inspirations.</li><li> <em>Burst</em> included Beys based on the first and second forms of the main four from the original anime, but not the earlier versions used in both the toyline and manga. Wolborg also got a release in Burst form. In addition, several Metal Sage Beyblades<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3dw9o');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3dw9o" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3dw9o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Storm Pegasus, Lightning L-Drago, Rock Leone, Flame Sagittario, Earth Eagle, and Burn Fireblaze</span> got reimagined as Burst Beyblades.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>: Several packaged Beyblades are built specifically for one purpose, rather then being designed to be playable. Some are specifically designed to go against another specific Beyblade, and the two are usually packaged together. However, they are usually released this way to introduce new parts into the game rather than to be use as-is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsExplosion">Defeat Equals Explosion</a>: Not quite <em>explosion</em>, but the concept behind <em>Beyblade: Burst</em> is that defeat makes your Bey fly apart. Beyond that, it was fairly common for the Attack Ring or Blade Base of an older or improperly assembled Bey to fly off in the original. More distressingly, certain Metal Saga Spin Tracks were prone to catastrophic failure if the Face Bolt was tightened too much, which damage the threading.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a>:<ul><li> The Final:Drive included with Cosmic Pegasus F:D has a tip which retracts as the Beyblade loses spin. Once it fully retracts, it becomes a wide rubber flat tip meant to give one last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> before spinning out.</li><li> <em>Burst</em>'s Reboot tip is basically the same, but narrower and without the rubber. the sharp tip retracting gives the Bey greater mobility at the cost of depleting the last of its stamina. It's somewhat more effective than Final:Drive. Ultimate Reboot adds to that a rubber base with the same "stabilizers" that many <em>Burst</em> tips have, again meant for a last-second increase in mobility.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a>: <em>Metal Saga<strong>s Final:Drive and </strong></em>Bursts Reboot and Ultimate Reboot tips have a tip that retracts once the Bey equipped with them slows down enough. This causes a more aggressive second tip to connect with the stadium floor, increasing movement speed and hopefully turning a stalemate or close loss into a win. However, they are very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> due to the low velocity making for weak hits, while the increased movement speed from higher friction means it will lose stamina much faster. Reboot is slightly better than F:D because it lacks rubber and has a smaller secondary tip, but Ultimate Reboot more or less recreates F:D's impracticality to the letter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>:<ul><li> Balance types. Getting <em>juuuust</em> the right parts is really tricky, but can have awesome results. For example, a <em>Burst</em> Beyblade with a high stamina tip, heavy Forge Disc, and a good Attack type Layer or Frame results in a solid counterattack specialist that has minimal movement and heavy deflective power.</li><li> Ringing out a heavy Defense build, or most Stationary builds for that matter. Because they tend to stay near the center and return there as quickly as possible if moved, forcing them out of the ring can be a personal victory since it means making something with enough force to overcome its advantages. The worst culprits are those that use ball bearing bases like Fortress, Orbit, or Atomic, but in <em>Burst</em> the toughest is Liner due to its extremely niche feature of being the fastest to return to center at the cost of some stamina.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>: Extremely common.<ul><li> Starting with <em>Metal Fury</em> (originally <em>Metal Fight Beyblade</em>), every series except <em>Burst</em> has had a new name outside of Japan. <em>Metal Fight</em> became <em>Metal Fusion</em>, <em>Burst God</em> became <em>Burst: Evolution</em>, etc.</li><li> The names of several Beyblades, including <em>almost every single one</em> in <em>Burst</em>, are changed for different reasons. Sometimes it's marketing, sometimes it's cultural or religious sensitivity.<ul><li> <em>Metal Fury</em>'s Fusion Hades was mainly changed to avoid confusion: The Fusion Fusion Wheel sounds redundant, and there is a Hades Fusion Wheel, meaning it would be possible to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">Hades Hades</a> Bey. As such, it was changed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Fusefire Darkhelm</a>.</li><li> Almost <em>every</em> <em>Burst</em> Beyblade got a new name in the US for marketing purposes, as well as shying away from the mythological angle that most got their names from. Most of the few that didn't already had names altered from the mythological being they were based on. It would be a hard sell in America for a kid's toy to be named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>.</em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>:<ul><li> The first series had tops which were much different than anything after them, and had the greatest variety of part types. Some were only barely compatible with previous sets, to the point that Basic series parts became unusable. The first Blade Base had to be assembled with screws, and the second was also held in by clips that slid into the sides.</li><li> The first four waves of starter sets of <em>Metal Fight Beyblade</em> had used a single Metal Wheel rather than the Energy Ring/Fusion Wheel combo that came after them. They got replaced to add more variety to the game and also to address launchers having their prongs broken off.</li><li> At least for the Japanese release, the first several waves of <em>Beyblade Burst</em> had basic Energy Layers and simpler Drivers and Discs, with the Dual Layer sets released later and having a mix of gimmicked and simple types for other parts. Hasbro reworked several of these to follow a more straightforward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>, with some pushed all the way back to <em>Burst: Evolution</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>: <em>Shogun Steel</em> Beys have Crystal/Element wheels that show through the metal wheel as an "Element orb".

It has a more detailed appearance, but is still a large blue hybrid dragon with prominent claws.</li><li> The Wheel Forge Disc is based on the Libra Metal Wheel from the first set of <em>Metal Fight Beyblade</em> releases. This is somewhat odd as the Forge Disk is more equivalent to the Spin Track of the Metal Saga design than any version of the Wheel part.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionableAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionableAsymmetry">Fashionable Asymmetry</a>:<ul><li> The <em>Shogun Steel</em> wheels were <em>never</em> fully symmetrical. This was specifically so that none of them would be "overbalanced" to the point that they couldn't be knocked over. The hole and peg in each wheel guaranteed that no perfectly symmetrical designs could be made. The only way to get perfect weight distribution is to have two of the same Metal Wheel in a Synchrome configuration.</li><li> The Valtryek Energy Layer and its upgrade V2 both have a left-facing Valkyrie with three spikes on the edge of the wheel. Most other <em>Burst</em> Energy Layers have minor details that are different on one side than the other.</li><li> Doomscisor and Doomscisor D2 both feature left-facing grim reapers with the blade of his scythe forming the edge of their energy layers.

First, the all-metal construction of the Metal Wheel put more stress on the prongs of the launcher than the later Hybrid Wheel System did, resulting in broken launchers. The second was the Libra wheel, which had such effective defense and stamina that a Balance type build using it would be basically unbeatable and was banned from the very first official tournament.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a>: Most of the tops have English names in Japan. <em>Burst</em> in particular has all of the Dual Layer, God Layer, and Super Z Layer pieces include a common English word.

L-Drago Destructor LW105LF was the most successful of these. It has high weight, high mobility, and decent stamina that made it capable of quick ring-outs.</li><li> Luinor L3 Destroy continues the tradition, being very fast and heavy with little self-recoil and high Burst resistance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull">A Load of Bull</a>:<ul><li> Bull 125SF and Dark Bull H145D.

The entire franchise exists to sell toys, and the cross sell is particularly heavy since you can't just buy one top and be able to play.

Most types of wheels aren't even considered in the <em>Metal Fusion</em> tournaments, being severly outclassed. There's even a whole website dedicated to the meta, the World Beyblade Organization. It's better in <em>Burst</em> where most parts are usable in at least one combination. Fortunately, tier lists aren't quite as common anymore because of how debatable the utility of any given part has become. Many old metagame tactics have been beaten using parts combinations previously snubbed as being too niche or luck-based.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a>:<ul><li> Around the middle of each season, the anime gets an upgrade for the characters in the form of new parts, launchers, and other accessories. This is also the time that new equipment shows up on the toy shelf.</li><li> Starting with <em>Metal Fury</em> and continuing up through <em>Shogun Steel</em>, the characters have had their Beyblade evolve (either directly or through acquiring new parts) around the mid-point of the season, with corresponding toys at the same time. <em>Burst</em> bucked the trend by having the basic version as a Single Pack and the Dual Layer version for the first four available from the beginning, as well as having the odd distinction of not necessarily being an actual upgrade; some basic Burst Beyblade are actually <em>better</em> than their Dual Layer counterparts.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>: Defense Beyblades. They're heavy and ponderous, but designed to last against strong attacks. Their mass lets them turn an Attack Bey's momentum against it, as well as helping them stay near the bottom of the stadium.

This almost never happens because the fight ends when one of them stops spinning; rolling around on its edge is still considered active. Sometimes, though, they'll bump into each other while rolling and just stop, while other times they'll simply be too close for most people to be able to tell.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePanzer">My Little Panzer</a>: Granted, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">obviously nowhere near as bad as the anime</a>, always make sure the components for the Beyblades are on <em>tight</em> and <em>never</em> stand too close to the arenas while playing.

Both of the top tier L-Drago wheels got a significant weight reduction when Hasbro licensed them.</li><li> <em>Burst</em> takes the cake. The Japanese version has small grooves cut into the bottom of the Layers to accommodate the tabs on the Drivers. This made it a bit harder to Burst the Beyblade, while also adding some strategy to the game. The Hasbro version omits them entirely, using a nearly identical sloped surface on all Layers instead. This was primarily due to play wear greatly effecting performance. Despite this, some like Dark Deathscyther/Doomscizor D2 have nearly identical performance.</li><li> <em>Burst Turbo</em> has seen the biggest Nerf of all time with the removal of <em>all</em> metal parts on the Energy Layers, including in Beyblades whose selling point was their metal parts. Nightmare Luinor L4 is the first Luinor with no metal at all, and Galaxy Zeutron lacks the bearings that make its Japanese counterpart as good as it is. Additionally, mechanical gimmicks like Krusher Roktavor R4's blades are no longer moving parts but instead just static molded details. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">this isn't all bad</a>, since <em>Cho-Z</em> Beyblades had the distinction of rarely if ever bursting, despite this being the <em>main gimmick of the line</em>. <em>Turbo</em> Beyblades burst much more often than Takara look-alikes, and the lack of part gimmicks prevents newcomers from <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

It also skipped the String Launcher L in America, mostly because left spinners have an advantage over right-spinners (the majority of Beyblades) already.</li><li> <em>Burst</em>'s American launchers are based on the Japanese Entry Launcher, but are technically superior to it due to having more teeth in the ripcord. However, before the series was even localized TakaraTomy had moved on to the Light Launcher and Long Winder, which addresses issues with the Entry Launcher; namely, that the lack of a ratchet makes the tops prone to slipping off while setting them up to launch which results in "misfires". As a result, the Hasbro releases of the toys are prone to the same issues as the Entry Launcher despite technically launching as fast as the Light Launcher. The release of the String Launcher outside of Japan seems to have finally put them on equal footing, and <em>Evolution</em> introduced an upgraded two-direction String Launcher.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSeasonNewName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSeasonNewName">New Season, New Name</a>: The original became <em>V-Force</em> and later <em>G-Revolution</em>. <em>Metal Fury</em> became <em>Metal Fusion</em> then <em>Metal Masters</em>. <em>Burst</em> became <em>Burst God</em>/<em>Burst: Evolution</em> then <em>Burst Super Z.</em>/<em>Burst: Turbo</em>, and later <em>Burst GT</em>/<em>Burst: Rise</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a>: An Element Wheel available in <em>Shogun Steel</em> is called this.</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalCompatibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalCompatibility">Nominal Compatibility</a>:<ul><li> The connectors on <em>Burst</em> launchers to allow multiple launches from one ripcord are included on launchers that don't use ripcords or use different ripcords, or in some case only include the male connector but no female connector.

However, Left- and Right-spin Chips and Bases were mutually exclusive, meaning there were very few Left-Spin combinations in comparison to Right-spin.</li><li> Some Energy Layers and Performance Tips have their own built-in equivalent to a Forge Disk, meaning the resulting Beyblade will only have two main parts. However, this means that in both cases and especially with each other, they aren't able to use all of the other parts that should be available. For example, Nightmare Luinor can't use several performance tips because they won't fit its built-in Forge Disc, while the Generate-H Tip can't be used with certain Energy Layers because its own built-in Disc gets in the way.</li><li> For Metal Saga, Left- and Right-spin Energy Rings had to be used with the same spin Fusion Wheel. The first dual-spin Metal Beyblade, Gravity Destroyer, had an Energy Ring AND Fusion Wheel that basically only worked with each other.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>: Zombie builds.

Some have designed custom parts that let you omit Spin Tracks or allowing right spin tops to spin left. Launching them edge-wise to see how far they'll roll was popular enough to create a spinoff series.</li><li> Some spin-stealing Beyblades can be launched <em>by hand</em> and may actually do better that way than with a launcher. Spin-stealing relies on the opponent's Beyblade starting out faster than yours, so a weak launch can actually slow another Beyblade down faster than if the spin is close to equal.</li><li> On that note, an exceptionally fast spin-stealing Defense Beyblade can actually be used to <em>speed up</em> an opposing Beyblade. This may not sound very useful, but if the opponent Bey has a high mobility tip, this can lead to an easy ring-out.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Our Dragons Are Different</a>: Many of them spin left.

It looks mostly like an Eastern dragon but with huge claws and a stockier, more Western body. Strata Dragoon, considered a different Bit Beast than Dragoon, had a similar but white and gold design for its monster. Its actual Beyblade parts are generally purple and included mechanical gimmicks in its parts. It's also a right-spinner, which makes it stand out among Beyblade dragons.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5x1rg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5x1rg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5x1rg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The very first Beyblade, Spin Dragoon, was not particularly noteworthy compared to other early Initial System toys.</span></li><li> Wyvern DJ from the Hard Metal System incorporates the letters D and J into the design of its Attack Ring. The dragon heads sculpted into it appear to be based on Strata Dragoon. One variation included a free-spinning Weight Disc Frame that made it perform much the same as Strata Dragoon, as well.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Metal</em> Saga:<ul><li> <em>Metal Fusion</em> has two motifs. L-Drago's series all have three heads detailed into them and has more variations than any other beast. Omega Dragonis is the odd one out in that it is a <em>right</em> spinner and is themed on a Western dragon. They share similar design cues due to being based on the same constellation, and in the anime being Dragonis is used by Ryuga's younger brother Ryuto.</li><li> Dragoon in <em>Shogun Steel</em> at first appears to be a new version of L-Drago (including its counterclockwise spin), but has wings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionableAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionableAsymmetry">Fashionable Asymmetry</a>. It also got two stand-alone variations that both used the Ronin Element Wheel - one plain silver, and one painted black, with different Spin Tracks and Tips for each.</li><li> The Wyvern/Wyvang Wheel in <em>Shogun Steel</em> and Wyvron Layers in <em>Burst</em> are both based on the two-legged dragon variety, and both are right-spinning. Wyvron W3 is designed as a call-back to Gaia Strata Dragoon, having a free-spinning ring to deflect attacks built into its Energy Layer.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Burst</em>:<ul><li> Luinor L2 and its upgrade Nightmare Longinus appears to be an Eastern Dragon, with a fiery mane and long body. It also has bat-like wings and a horned crest on its forehead. The dragon-head designs (2 on L2, 4 on Nightmare) are made of metal, the first and only of its kind in <em>Burst</em> until <em>Chou-Z</em>/<em>Turbo</em>. Furthermore, Nightmare Longinus has a built-in Forge Disc, meaning only the Tip can be swapped out. Bloody Longinus, its <em>Chou-Z</em> version, has 4 dragon heads akin to Fight Dragoon from the original series with a larger fifth one in the center.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6cfs7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6cfs7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6cfs7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <em>Beyblade Burst Turbo</em> version released by Hasbro and its partners doesn't include any metal at all in its design, which is different in its own right.</span> Zwei Luinor, from <em>Burst: Rise</em>, stands out from its predecessors in that its dragon design is much less sinister. It has two metal heads on its default Layer Base (Zwei) and two plastic ones on its GT chip (Luinor), and appears to take more after the original than either of its prior updates. Rage Luinor has only two heads on the outer edges and one on its Superking Chip, but also has an extending "blade" that protrudes from under the Layer Base. It also lacks the ability to use a Forge Disk, and incorporates elements of all 4 of its previous incarnations.</li><li> Drain Fafnir is specifically designed to spin-steal, and the first to do so specifically for <em>Burst</em>. It's also three Nordic-inspired serpents in a striking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrangeBlueContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrangeBlueContrast">orange and blue</a> design. Its Bey Spirit design (seen in the app and anime) had 6 eyes. Geist Fafnir, its upgrade for <em>Turbo</em>, has even larger rubber contact points to improve its spin-steal ability. <em>Burst: Rise</em> adds Wizard Fafnir, which keeps most of the same design elements and abilities.</li><li> Balkesh B3 (Arc Bahamut) has a rotating inner ring that fills the gaps between its contact points as it gets closer to bursting. As a left-spinner, it also has a reduced burst rate against right-spinners. Dread Bahamut from <em>Burst: Rise</em> seems to keep this gimmick.</li><li> Salamander S4 has a moving set of spikes that can be locked in place or move freely, altering its Attack and Defense properties. It also comes with the fairly unique Operate Performance Tip, the only perfectly round tip without "stabilizers". Operate can also be pushed off-center to improve its attack potential and potentially <em>hop</em>.</li><li> <em>Burst: Rise</em> has the Dragon Gatinko/GT Chip, included in the Rock, Ace, Grand, and Command Dragon combos. Appearance-wise, it's a loose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Dragoon<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7wtay');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7wtay" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7wtay');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The anime and tie-in app give it red claws, but are gold on the toy.</span>. Command, though, is unique among Gatinko Beyblades in that it doesn't take a Weight, having an extra-heavy Layer Base. It also doesn't have a <em>Forge Disc</em>, due to its Performance Tip having one built in.</li><li> Leviathan is a water-themed winged serpent, and unusual as both a Hasbro exclusive Avatar and the first Western-exclusive left-spin chip.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Our Vampires Are Different</a>: Beyblades with the spin-steal ability, like L-Drago Absorb and the <em>Burst</em> Fafnir line. Beyblades that spin the opposite direction as their opponents tend to equalize spin, gaining speed when contacting a faster Beyblade. This means during the initial few clashes, a slower left-spinner will drain a right-spinner's stamina while speeding up and gaining balance. Those with soft rubber parts are better at it. A few rare right spinners can as well, but only against left spinners; otherwise, they actually <em>lose</em> stamina very quickly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Our Zombies Are Different</a>: Zombies are builds that have the "Life After Death" feature, which means that they're really good at spinning even when on their side. Since a Beyblade is only considered to have lost when it stops moving, they're still technically in the game despite being on their sides. They tend to have relatively smooth, round outer edges and Defense or Stamina parts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a>:<ul><li> For Metal Saga, Hasbro released most of their tops in a standard release and a Legends version. For the Spark FX version, they were recolored compared to the Japanese version of the same parts. The Legends version would be the show accurate version and more faithful to the TakaraTomy release.</li><li> Both sides of the pond love to make limited edition all-gold versions. Probably because they sell really well.</li><li> For <em>Burst</em>, almost every Hasbro Beyblade came in a single pack and a double pack, with different colored Layers and Tips between the two. The QR codes on them even unlock different colored versions in the app. The versions that came in Starter Packs and Starter Sets, as well as the special multipacks with several extra Performance Tips, also had their own coloration and QR codes. Additionally, several Energy Layers got rereleased in later sublines with new colors and their names updated to match the current gimmick. At first the app treated these as variants of their earlier versions, but later changed it to separate them. For example, Blizzard-X Gaianon G4 was originally treated as Gaianon G2 but now has a separate entry in the Beylocker.</li><li> Most Gatinko Beyblades&#146; Layer Bases and GT Chips have a golden variant, dubbed Gold Turbo<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8njqh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8njqh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8njqh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">dubbed as Hyper-Flux by Hasbro</span> versions. They are sometimes included in place of their normal versions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>: Every series has an escalating series of upgrades introduced as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a> or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a>. Several former top tier parts are now barely used except in really esoteric builds. Fortunately tends to reset with each new iteration of the franchise.<ul><li> <em>Metal Saga</em> was particularly prone to this. Libra was so common in the initial <em>Metal</em> metagame that Takara banned it from tournament play, but by the time Twisted Tempo came out was so outclassed that it was useless. Even then, while <em>Metal Saga</em> and <em>Shogun Steel</em> parts are technically compatible, the former are at a disadvantage even in a regular Beystadium.</li><li> A lesser example was with the <em>Evolution</em> upgrade for <em>Burst</em>. Since Discs and Tips are interchangeable with Energy Layer and Dual Layer Beyblades, there are still some uses for earlier parts.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note93ye7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note93ye7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note93ye7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Since SwitchStrike Discs are only notably differentiated by weight since they all use plastic frames, some players prefer the more varied gimmicks of early Discs instead.</span> However, the (re)introduction of Spin-Stealing with Drain Fafnir means earlier Layer pieces won't stand up to it. The delay in introducing Gyro and Orbit until <em>Evolution</em> in the US was a deliberate attempt at enforcing this.</li><li> <em>Beyblade Burst Rise</em> finally pushed <em>Burst</em> over the edge with the Gatinko system into full-on Power Creep territory. The ability to adjust the weight and burst resistance of an Energy Layer due to having multiple interchangeable parts and the reintroduction of gimmicked center parts. There's also the Hybrid and Ignition' Performance Tips, which have battery-powered spinning tips to extend spin time. While the remote controlled Digital Control Kits for Genesis Valtryek and Fafnir gave improved control to the player, the electric tips for <em>Rise</em> are able to overpower even those and are allowed to be used in tournaments, unlike the Digital Control Kits.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun">The Power of the Sun</a>:<ul><li> The Sol Fusion Wheel and Blaze Energy Ring are themed after the Sun, with the shape particularly inspired by prominences.</li><li> <em>Burst</em>'s Amaterios Aero Assault is based on the sun goddess Amaterasu-omikami, with the Forge Disc being shaped very similarly to Blaze.

As the series has progressed, more gimmicky parts have been introduced up to <em>Evolution</em> and the SwitchStrike system, which adds plastic frames to Forge Discs and Performance Tips with moving parts built in.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct">Shoddy Knockoff Product</a>: Rapidity.

When done right, it causes Beyblades Attack type tips to move in a flower pattern, while Defense or Stamina tips will circle the outer stadium or Tornado Ridge more easily before spiraling into the center. Learning to do it isn't difficult, to the point that more players than not use it frequently.</li><li> The Metal Sharp and Metal Ball tips in <em>Metal Fusion</em> are some of the best available, and only notably different because of material.</li><li> Free-spinning tips like Eternal Sharp, Bearing:Drive, and Gyro give a tremendous advantage even though they're not much more complicated than standard tips.

This allows players to switch between Mobile and Stationary which can make a Bey much more effective, especially when up against a type it's naturally weak to. This also makes it difficult to accidentally knock into the wrong mode mid-battle.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a>:<ul><li> For the original series, each new season was marked with a new build system being introduced.

If one considers <em>Shogun Steel</em> to be part of it, then it can be seen as a case since the anime is in-continuity.</li><li> The upgrade to SwitchStrike parts for <em>Burst</em> doesn't quite preclude the need for earlier parts, but any viable Beyblade needs at least one new piece to hold up.</li><li> Averted with <em>Turbo</em>. Many Beyblades are merely different from the early <em>Evolution</em> designs, rather than being objectively better.

Based on the special ability of the Running Core of the original series and a popular case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">Not the Intended Use</a> for the special spin tracks included in the Destroyer Dome Beystadium. Like <em>Metal Fusion</em>, the wheels are made up of several parts bolted together.</li><li> <em>BeyWarriors</em>, which used action figures with gyroscopic tops built into their bases. Like the other series, they could swap parts to create customized fighters but doing so had little effect on gameplay. Only the arms were swappable, with the flywheel, figure, and tip all part of the same piece.</li><li> BeyRaiderz, introduced as part of ''BeyWarriors. Small cars with large flywheels in the center. Players rev them up before sending them rolling towards a goal to try to hit a target and collect a token if it hit. It uses an odd number of tokens to prevent ties. The player with the most tokens wins. Lacked any customization but included an "automatic return" gimmick, where the cars would roll backwards once they slowed down.</li><li> <em>Beyblade Micros</em> uses extra small versions of the <em>Burst</em> Beys while retaining some of its customization features; the two-part <em>Micros</em> Beyblades can replace their tips with those from the main <em>Burst</em> toyline to make rather silly looking tall, narrow tops, in addition to being able to swap their own parts around.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">Tactical Rock&#150;Paper&#150;Scissors</a>: Attack &lt; Defense &lt; Stamina &lt; Attack, in general.

They were only released by Hasbro, seemingly to give an option with similar properties that was consistent with existing products.</li><li> The first version of several <em>Metal Fury</em> Beys, like VariAres and L-Dragon Destructor F:S, lacked the gimmicks of the Japanese version of those toys. The version released under the Hyperblades moniker used new colors but included the gimmicks left out of their initial release.</li><li> The Dragoon, Dranzer, Draciel, Driger, Wolborg, and Gaia Dragoon Attack Rings from the original series, as well as the Storm Pegasus, Lightning L-Drago, Rock Leone, Earth Aquilla, and Flame Saggitario combos from the Metal era were adapted into <em>Burst</em> Energy Layers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremelyKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremelyKoolLetterz">Xtremely Kool Letterz</a>: The way they capitalize "eXtreme Top System" is obviously meant to invoke this.
