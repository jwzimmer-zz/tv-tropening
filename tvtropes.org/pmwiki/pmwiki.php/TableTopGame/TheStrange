Prisoners translate into the forms of armless, eyeless, and legless versions of themselves and are wheeled into high-security cells, under both magical and technological wards, without the ability to interact with other prisoners.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">Alien Abduction</a>: Greys sometimes abduct humans for study and return the victims later after a thorough examination.

There are steam engines, electricity, the appearance of firearms in limited quantities and several time-saving machines, which would be anachronisms on Earth during the same historical period.</li><li> Ohunkakan was spun from the traditional stories of the Lakota people and the ever-shifting flood of modern anachronisms. The familiar freely mixes with the mythic, and elements of gone ages stubbornly persist alongside images pulled from modern Earth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a>:<ul><li> The New Kingdom is a recursion located along a Nile where pharaohs yet rule the land, and ancient Egyptian gods are revered, as is the Pharaoh himself. Pyramids of previous pharaohs contain elaborate traps and vicious guardians protecting the body and grave goods of the former rulers, ensuring their place in the afterlife.</li><li> An ancient recursion was seeded by belief in the ancient Egyptian afterlife and included the likenesses of many pharaohs waking into their promised heavenly kingdoms. It has since collapsed, and some of these dark energy pharaohs have fled to the Strange and still survive there.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>: Those who opt to be housed in Apoptosis-class battle chrysalides are in never-ending pain.

The fact that Lancelot has yet to submit to the infection is the only source of strength that Galahad's remaining humanity holds to, so the <em>m&eacute;canisme</em> controlling intelligence has made Lancelot's conversion or death its number one priority.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: Two of the more powerful elder spirits in Ohunkakan, the Thunderer and the Horned Serpent, have been at war since time began. Their continuous struggle, as regular and as unavoidable as weather, is terrible and awe-inspiring to behold.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Archmage</a>: Merlin is a wizard who has learnt so many spells and accumulate so much lore that he becomes incredibly powerful.

But whenever the Kavacha is taken from the archives and worn by a legitimate officer of the Eleventh Reich, the wearer inevitably dies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a>: Venom troopers are humanoids grown in large numbers in vats within mobile factories in Ruk, primarily by Zal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie">Artificial Zombie</a>: Singularitar zombies are living shells for the distributed intelligence calling itself Singularitar. The original minds have been burned out, and a copy of Singularitar has been installed in the meat as wetware.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology">Artistic License &#150; Paleontology</a>: Justified: the various "lost world" recursions are seeded by popular media and misconceptions as opposed to facts.<div class="indent"><strong>Dr Sybil Holloway:</strong> The actual paleontological record informs the look of <em>Deinonychus</em> as found in recursions, but the two don't usually match. Recursions aren't often seeded by factual leakage, more's the pity.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascended to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>: A free-roaming instance of the Singularitan AI is mounting an expedition into Microcosmica. This creature, a data sentinel, seeks the brain and believes that if it's successful, it will achieve an ascendant state as great as or greater than Singularitar itself. An ascendant state risks conferring planetovore status on the data sentinel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator">The Assimilator</a>:<ul><li> A hydra will incorporate the heads of victims with useful knowledge or skill. At first, such a head begs and pleads for release from the horror of its new existence, but eventually it seems to find peace as part of the collective.</li><li> A nezerek is driven to discover new experiences and knowledge, and to gain that experience, it tends to assimilate anything new it comes into contact with, especially living creatures.</li><li> Variokaryons have purchased banned grafts that allow them to harvest biological matter from other creatures and directly incorporate that matter into themselves.</li><li> A blob absorbs its prey, integrating a victim's tissue into its own. In essence, the victim becomes the blob, and all of the victim's knowledge is available to the blob. If it later desires, a blob can release a nearly perfect replicant of any creature that it has absorbed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster">Asteroids Monster</a>: An eosinophil in Microcosmica can split into smaller eosinophils that cannot split further.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>: This recursion originated with Darum Tal Alumust, the sole survivor of a world that fell prey to a planetovore. Escaping to the Strange, he later made his way to Earth, took some humans to his laboratory, enhanced their health and intelligence, then fled back to the Strange to avoid a planetovore. Over the next few thousand years, stories on Earth of these advanced people began to spread and over time created fiction that shaped Alumust's hiding place in the Strange. It grew into a recursion and became the Atlantis of myth, a myth inadvertently seeded by Alumust. Most of the recursion is open water, but at its centre lies a great city.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>: Laran-xi is a former agent of the Karum who killed many Quiet Cabal members during secret conflicts that occurred outside of Ruk. She has since left the Karum and regrets her actions and hopes that both factions have forgotten her, but she is prepared to face it if justice someday finds her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>: Elandine, ruler of the Queendom of Hazurrium, stands at level 7, the highest of all NPCs in the Queendom.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyPlanet">Baby Planet</a>: Each planet in Rebel Galaxy is only about the size of a city, or a city and its surrounding environs&#151;probably no more than a dozen miles across at most.

In the Hadean aeon, a small piece of a defunct alien intergalactic transport system called Aleph collided with it. Later, the evolving sapient life on Earth triggered a residual function in the Aleph component. The component released a unique quantum field energy that had many repercussions, the main one being that the Earth became connected to the Strange in a way few, if any, other prime worlds ever were. Earth is a rare planet, in that it has generated hundreds of recursions through fictional leakage and hosts paradoxes, spinners and vectors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthThatWas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthThatWas">Earth That Was</a>: A class of recursions known as the Dead Earths has a somewhat self-explanatory name: all (or almost all) life on Earth has been destroyed in a cataclysm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EgomaniacHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EgomaniacHunter">Egomaniac Hunter</a>: For Nimrod the Hunter, recursions offer a veritable bounty of things to kill.

Even if a recursor manages the almost impossible task of translating into R639, nothing is learned from context, as if entering it via inapposite gate. That dearth of information says something, implying that R639 breaks the fundamental rules of recursion travel. It is a glitch in the Strange.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">Elemental Embodiment</a>: Spirits of earth, wind, fire, water, thorn and bone inhabit recursions where the law of Magic gives them form.

Old slights and betrayals have not been forgotten: former associates of Arthur consider Mordred cruel and sadistic, leading through fear and intimidation, and he only shows sympathy to outsiders whose original loyalties didn't lie with Camelot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine">Eternal Engine</a>: The Grand Imperium controls many factory planets, entire worlds devoted to the mass production of goods needed by the rest of the Rebel Galaxy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Everyone Calls Him "Barkeep"</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">F&uuml;hrer</a> of the Eleventh Reich is never called by his real name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a>: Sometimes the vicious laughter of a zombie nightstormer that has just caught a victim echoes through the night for miles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble">Big Bad Ensemble</a> of Ardeyn.

His smile seems guileless, his declarations are from the heart, and his absentminded fumbling comes across as endearing. This is an act: Moriarty has a vengeful streak, and those who wrong him may eventually see his cruel side, right before they die in some painful fashion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FesteringFungus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FesteringFungus">Festering Fungus</a>: The cyphers from Crash carry an infection that slowly kills the victim with invading fungal growth, then mind-coring pods sprout and feed on the corpse. The fungi already have an odd awareness of the Strange, and could continue their evolution, gain a slow vegetable sentience or possibly the spark or even become quickened.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">Fighter, Mage, Thief</a>: The three character types: Vectors (action-oriented people with great strength, stamina and speed) are the Fighter; Paradoxes (people that bend the rules like mad scientists or sorcerers) are the Mage; Spinners (people that spin tales, lies or different versions of the truth to bluff and mislead) are the Thief.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside">Fighting from the Inside</a>: As is true of many victims of the <em>maladie de la machine</em>, remnants of Galahad's original personality persist within his electronic brain.

His name is Robot Lad, but Gearbox doesn't know it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">Nuclear Nasty</a>: The zombies infesting the Braidwood Nuclear Generating Plant in Zed Amrica are highly radioactive. When they swarm out of the facility every few nights, they glow with a flickering, greenish-blue light and leave a blackened trail of dead plants and animals in their wake, which is impossible to miss.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oculothorax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oculothorax">Oculothorax</a>: All-seeing eyes are flying, disembodied eyeballs with an unblinking stare.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousFog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousFog">Ominous Fog</a>: R639 resembles a Seattle in December without power and one where everyone has vanished. Cloud cover is constant, grey and oppressive, and a seeping damp chill pervades everything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneCharacterMultipleLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneCharacterMultipleLives">One Character, Multiple Lives</a>: Before the founding of Edo in Samurai Sky, Ieyasu Tokugawa and three others were attacked by an oni and a hundred brigands. The oni attempted to rip the life from the four and feed it to the brigands, but the spell rebounded: their life force was magically infused into Tokugawa and his three companions. Now, when any of the four die, that life is debited against the one hundred and one extra lives given to the group until they run out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganAutonomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganAutonomy">Organ Autonomy</a>: For years, the Ankaseri faction of Ruk sold a weaponised artificial heart graft called angiophage. Upon receiving a proper passcode, followed by instructions given audibly or while the recipient was connected by umbilical to the All Song, an angiophage would leave off its duties in a recipient's chest, dig its way out, and attack a designated target, killing the recipient in the process.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrpheanRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrpheanRescue">Orphean Rescue</a>: A possibility, if you die in Ardeyn.

When the Betrayal occurred and the Incarnations failed, the qephilim became mortal.</li><li> In Starship Heinlein, the angels are no more than humans living on a generation ship that consider themselves holy. They have retained some semblance of the knowledge required to keep a starship operational, which they consider rituals of worship, not science. Angels each have a revelation, which they see as proof of their divine heritage but in truth are merely drones that provide owners with basic access to certain functions provided by the starship.</li><li> Each of the golem-like angels of Eschatos appears like a different extinct terrestrial animal forged of silver. They serve Eris, a magitech entity who oversees the Last City, the home of the last humans in a universe that has undergone heat death.</li><li> Aviatars are warriors who appear to be lithe, muscular humans with feathered wings. Some think them angels, but do not work toward some benevolent ideal and are interested in their own sense of honour and justice. In some recursions, aviatars might be angels, doling out divine vengeance. In others, they might be the last of an ancient, magic race.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Our Demons Are Different</a>:<ul><li> In Ardeyn, demons of Lotan are the spirits that slip through the nets of umber judges and spirit magistrates and find their way to Lotan. Every good memory is cauterised and every slight, misfortune, snub, and pain is amplified. The resulting mind knows only hate and the desire to tempt others into the same state as itself.</li><li> Hell Frozen Over is home to a variety of terrifying natives who resemble visually and behaviourally a few popular conceptions of demons and devils.</li><li> The demons of Starship Heinlein are people who survive contact with the alien seeds known as sinroots and get turned into homicidal maniacs.</li><li> Abysm, the afterlife of the Sword Realms, is inhabited by all manner of demons, including sword demons and chain demons.</li><li> The demons of Wuxia City are not the same kind of Western demons. These Chinese demons are often spirits of vicious animals, the lost pets of deities, or other supernatural beings. Not all are evil, and most seem to have the goal of achieving immortality through apotheosis.</li><li> Purgatory demons are goat-legged, wickedly horned demons, skeletons and creatures that seem like odd combinations of different animals. Some of them are aware of the inapposite gate linking the recursion to Earth and seek to wreak as much death and destruction as possible.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Our Dragons Are Different</a>:<ul><li> Dragons of Ardeyn, creations of Lotan, are massive, feathered, exceptionally territorial and competitive. They love games of all sorts, especially ones that end with the nondragon loser being eaten.</li><li> Glass dragons of the Glass Desert are creatures of magic, spawned by the destruction of the Maker's Hall that also created the desert itself. Learned sorcerers suggest that other dragons of disaster probably exist in Ardeyn, having been spawned by various catastrophes. They are draconic only in broad outline, appearing as animate collections of shattered glass.</li><li> Demon drakes are the biggest, rarest and strongest demons in Hell Frozen Over. They refer to themselves as lords of Hell and play up their demonic role to the fullest, but are well aware of the Strange and enjoy the status as the biggest fish in their recursion. Their bodies are covered in scales that seem almost metallic.</li><li> A dragon resides in Oceanmist, and the resident pirates bring it booty and treasure as a sign of respect. The dragon is scaled, not feathered like those in Ardeyn. The dragon is nameless and doesn't currently possess the spark. Clinically depressed, it only rouses if forced to defend itself or its hoard, or if visitors suggest a game. Each of the prominent natives of Oceanmist with the spark independently concluded that it was necessary to win the dragon as an ally.</li><li> Tetsu are dragonlike creatures seeded by Japanese myth. Despite a lack of wings, a tetsu's magic allows it to fly and gives it a host of potential abilities. Even the smallest lake in Seishin Shore is usually guarded by a territorial tetsu that regards the mote as its home.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">Our Dwarves Are All the Same</a>: Dwarves are a squat, broad, and bearded race native to the Sword Realms.

The rest of the time, a giant is human-sized and appears (and may live) just like a regular human. Episodes of gigantism, when the giant is a house-sized rampaging monster, are forgotten by the giant, except perhaps only as a vague dream. The curse of gigantism is normally passed by blood, but usually doesn't strike until the age of 35.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">Our Ghosts Are Different</a>: A spirit of wrath is a bodiless spirit of rage and loss created when a spirit of a dead creature in Ardeyn fails to find its way to the Night Vault, escapes it, or is summoned forth by a necromancer. On occasion, a wrath still remembers its life and may respond to questions, seek to locate its loved ones or enemies, or attempt to finish a task it started in life. But in time, its mind will erode and it becomes a mindless monster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">Our Ghouls Are Creepier</a>:<ul><li> Ghouls in Halloween are goblins who have developed a taste for the flesh of their fellows. Hungry for flesh (even rotting flesh), they dig up about one in ten fresh graves in the Graveyard.</li><li> In Wuxia City, a ghoul is a person who sought the sacrament of the Darkness and willingly became a supernatural entity of endless hunger. Ghouls can see in the dark, are immortal unless killed, and understand the pleasure of gnawing human flesh.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">Our Goblins Are Different</a>: A Halloween goblin looks somewhat like the original recursor but is about 1 m tall, with green-hued skin and a predisposition for a pointy nose.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHydrasAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHydrasAreDifferent">Our Hydras Are Different</a>: They're creations of Lotan with five or more heads, and assimilate the heads of their victims into their collective self if these possess useful knowledge or skills. A hydra will shed excess heads if it gains more than it can easily manage, which will braid together to form a new hydra.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOgresAreHungrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOgresAreHungrier">Our Ogres Are Hungrier</a>: Sadistic, two-meters-tall, cannibalistic fiends that prey upon other creatures in the woods, mountains or other wilderness areas of recursions that operate under the law of Magic.

When left to their own devices, they turn on each other, the strongest oppressing the next weakest and so on. No two orcs look exactly alike, but all have stooped backs, crooked legs and a mean, ugly, shambolic facade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">Our Souls Are Different</a>: Living, thinking beings have souls... if they're in Ardeyn, or perhaps similar recursions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent">Our Spirits Are Different</a>: The spirits of Ohunkakan were birthed by the stories themselves.

The very nature and essence of the vampire is evil and anti-life, even as they revel in their own endless existence. The recursion known as Gloaming is home to many vampires.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Our Werewolves Are Different</a>: When not transformed, many werewikves seem like completely normal people. They usually transform into bloodthirsty, rampaging wolves at night in response to moon-related cues, except a few who can control their transformation. They often forget what they did while transformed or even realise that they are werewolves at all. The few that do either kill themselves before their next transformation or learn to revel in the butchery.

Little is known about them other than the evidence of their thefts, and the rumour that when the guild principals meet, they wear golden masks to hide their true identities from one another.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight">Things That Go "Bump" in the Night</a>: The bogeymen that hunt for children in the night and drag them away never to be seen again are real in Magic recursions, but when children come crying about such monsters to their parents, the narrative that created the recursion demands them to assume that the culprit is a pile of clothes or the wind pushing branches against the glass.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">Thrown Out the Airlock</a>: One of the possible fates of the heretics who speak the truth about Starship Heinlein (contrary to what the priestesses preach) and are subsequently branded as criminals is to be ejected to the Abyss (outer space).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a>: Someone who succeeds on the Intellect roll when entering the light in the Temple of Time in Mesozoica gains a limited and local mastery over time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Tome of Eldritch Lore</a>: The Zauber Maleficarum, discovered by the wizards of Dyranmar, is a particularly foul book of spells. Supposedly haunted by the ghosts of its authors, the book has gained far too much agency.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomTheDarkLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomTheDarkLord">Tom the Dark Lord</a>: The real name of the Betrayer of Ardeyn and former Incarnation of War is Jason Cole.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyMouths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyMouths">Too Many Mouths</a>: Green homunculi have a second, extendible mouth within their main one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a>: Citizens of Panopticon deemed to be dissidents are disappeared and rendered to Truthdroids well versed in torturing a confession of guilt from anyone, regardless of actual seditious activity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">To Serve Man</a>: Recursors that translate into Kiplingverse in human form are given over to the tiger Shere Khan, who harbors a long-running grudge against humans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>: New recruits to the Beak Mafia are trained in a brutal lost-world recursion that eats normal wise kro for breakfast. Survivors are slapped with the label 'kro goon' and become part of whichever family sponsored them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a>:<ul><li> The Theater of War has a way of drawing recursors of failed translation attempts, and some physical relics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> sometimes open brief translation gates that trap unwitting victims, usually not quickened. This leads to the main reason recursors might choose to visit the Theater of War: to rescue those who have become trapped in the 'past'.</li><li> Desktop Terrene, where recursors are translated into inanimate objects on a desk and the only available focus confers an increasing acceptance of the placid existence in the recursion, was almost certainly constructed as a trap for recursors unaware of its danger.</li><li> The longer a recursor stays in Night's Edge, the more likely they will become entangled with the natives and become unwilling to leave. In Night's Edge, recursors can actually <em>lose</em> the spark. That's what happened to Sam Johnson, owner of the town diner.</li><li> The trunk of a vintage Ford Falcon Coupe on Earth offers a one-way inapposite gate to Cannibal Wasteland, which also houses a translation anchor which turns the recursion into a magnet for translation attempts that fail, pulling recursors off course into Cannibal Wasteland. The background radiation makes it impossible to translate away, except in the radiation-free Grotto of Whispers, whose proprietor doesn't take well to visitors. Jamala Landers, the local mechanic, is actually a recursor who has been stuck for a while and become somewhat crazed in her time spent in the wasteland.</li><li> The Game of Screams is linked to Halloween and can draw people into the game, trapping them until the game is finished.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeTopTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeTopTown">Tree Top Town</a>: Greeneyes live predominantly in nest-like structures hidden in the jungle canopy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror">Tripod Terror</a>: Alien tripod walkers tower over most buildings in the War of the Worlds, unleashing rays of frightening heat able to devastate the best that twentieth-century science can throw at them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">Truly Single Parent</a>: A hydra is born when the "parent" accumulates too many heads and discards some of them, which braid together and crawl away as a new hydra.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TubeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TubeTravel">Tube Travel</a>: A rapid-transport system operates in the Veritex tunnels connecting Shome and the Shadowed City, where people ride in a kind of slime-filled pneumatic tube between the two stations. Transport takes only a minute, if one is willing to put up with being covered in mucus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterBase">Underwater Base</a>: The Estate established a base in the ocean world of Thyrul III in Rebel Galaxy, which is essentially a large submersible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity">Underwater City</a>:<ul><li> The city of Juvanom, submerged under the central basin sea of Ardeyn.</li><li> Octopus sapiens live in underwater coral cities that contain hatcheries, larva playgrounds, plankton farms, ink art academies, research labs and dry chambers for interrogating humans.</li><li> The city of R'lyeh is usually drowned at the bottom of the ocean, but sometimes rises partly to the surface.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterRuins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterRuins">Underwater Ruins</a>: Rumour has it that at the endpoint of the Hydra Cascade underwater current is a ruin rumoured to be rich in magic, treasure, and lost secrets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>: Heinrich Himmler has no loyalty to anyone except the F&uuml;hrer. He'll betray any trust, exploit any weakness, and trample over any principle if it advances him or the Reich.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a>: If a powerful telepath died in the midst of attempting an important mission or task, their mental energies give the need to accomplish that task a life of its own. These psychic remnants have no free will or capacity to do anything other than attempt to complete the task that drives them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a>: Entropic seeds are sometimes offered as 'gifts' from planetovores to those inside a recursion or on a prime world, especially to those who are not fully aware of a planetovore's and seed's true nature. Though using an entropic seed may bring about the user's desires in the short term, such a thing could spell a terrible end for a recursion, or even a prime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a>: Urban Fantastic is the term given to a class of recursions seeded by the plethora of urban fantasy stories. It includes a recursion called Urban Wizardry and others of a similar bent. An Urban Fantastic recursion seems just like modern-day Earth, but one where magic and creatures of the night, of myth and of magic are all too real.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter">Vampire Hunter</a>: The Van Helsings of Gothic Playground oppose Dracula and his clan of vampires.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianLondon">Victorian London</a>: Gothic Playground is an 1890s Victorian England where vampires are all too real.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Vigilante Man</a>:<ul><li> New Centropolis has developed a legal framework to deal with the issue of superheroes being charged as vigilantes. If a superhuman is involved in some sort of incident, the Department of Superhuman Affairs looks into it afterwards. If the efforts of the superhuman in that event are found to be in the interest of the public good, all is well. However, if the acts of the superhuman are found to be questionable or outright illegal, the DSA may issue a warrant for their arrest.</li><li> Lucy Shattuck, a quickened native of Silverwood, hunts down criminals across recursions and brings them to vigilante justice, six-shooter style.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOverride">Villain Override</a>: Most myriands are part-time shift workers who have a completely different personality and aspect when not patrolling. When their shift comes up, an attached biological pod activates, transforming that person into a battle chrysalid. While transformed, the myriand loses all sense of its former identity, becoming hypervigilant, without pity or fear, and unable to do anything other than obey the letter of the law.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a>: Supervillains in New Centropolis sometimes make alliances, the longest lasting of which was the Conquerors, assembled by Doctor Amazing. Like most such alliances, the team eventually fell apart when the villains turned on each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a>:<ul><li> Lambent is a shared intelligence hosted in a fungus that evolved inside a radioactive crater where a bio lab once stood in Cataclyst. It can spread itself into the bodies of living creatures by killing their brains and filling the inside of their shells with a fungal copy.</li><li> A group of semi-mechanical sacrosancts in the Graveyard of the Machine God called the Washed grow their numbers by converting others to be like them, whether those others are unconverted sacrosancts or visitors.</li><li> The <em>maladie de la machine</em> is a virus that turns living flesh into a cybernetic equivalent. An infection can take days to completely convert a creature, though the process can be accelerated to less than one minute if another <em>m&eacute;canisme</em> is the direct vector.</li><li> A bite from a zombie in Zed America infects someone with virulent HRV that converts the victim over the course of one hour into another zombie.</li><li> The bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of its own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the thrall of the one that killed it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaddlingHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaddlingHead">Waddling Head</a>: Gnathostomes have no torso and resemble a large head set upon a pair of legs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">Walking Wasteland</a>: Anyone who spends too much time in Mister Genocide's presence becomes ill, even if he isn&#146;t actively using his power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarElephants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarElephants">War Elephants</a>: The scarbacks of Mesozoica sometimes ride mammoths when they hunt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Warrior Monk</a>: A few monks of the Order of the Orb are battle-hardened warriors who seek peace after years of conflict.

After they offended the gods with their vanity, they were transformed into hideous monsters.</li><li> The ghouls of Wuxia City were originally people who committed to the Darkness and willingly became supernatural entities.</li><li> Ratliff Mason was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> scholar who plunged straight away into the fiction he'd spent so much of his life studying once he found out he was quickened. He should have paid closer heed to the regrets penned by almost all of Lovecraft's fictional characters, as he ended up becoming a deep one.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">Weakened by the Light</a>:<ul><li> A vampire is burned by sunlight and any source of strong UV light.</li><li> Bogeymen have no power in the light. Even when fully manifested, as soon as the lights are on, they become undetectable and can do nothing but moving.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a>: The Dynamic League in the Borderlands of Sol made a deal for a quantity of antimatter normally impossible to gather in a Standard Physics recursion. Now the Dynamic League holds the balance of power, if they're willing to use their doomsday weapon; or they might simply be trying to build engines with beamed core antimatter technology that would give them easy access to Sol's outer system and all the riches in the Oort cloud.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a>:<ul><li> Calandria claims to be the Priest of Storms, and for a price, she will either quell a storm raging somewhere else in Ardeyn, or start one.</li><li> In addition to its brute strength, the naga imprisoned in the Temple of Time in Mesozoica has power over the weather.</li><li> Ariel can call up a tempest on the sea to draw mariners to wreck upon Sycorax Island.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdCurrency">Weird Currency</a>:<ul><li> Halloween currency is counted in individual pieces of wrapped hard candy.</li><li> Bullets are used as currency in Cannibal Wasteland.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo">Wendigo</a>: Cannibals in the Thunder Plains suffer a terrible curse that strips them of their humanity, turns them into monsters with an appetite for human flesh and causes them to hibernate in the hinterlands until the winter, when they become wendigos and prowl the darkest hours in search of human prey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">The Western</a>: The recursion Silverwood is a town in the American Old West, in the last half of the nineteenth century. Silverwood sees its share of bandits, Marshals, Native Americans and cowboys who'd be right at home in a western. As described by one Estate operative, Silverwood is where westerns go to die. A recursor might visit it to experience romantic notions of the American West; however, he had better be quick on the draw.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU">Wetware CPU</a>:<ul><li> Each crucible is a living supercomputer where polymers and alloys seamlessly fuse with flesh and blood.</li><li> In Singularitan, both electronic and flesh avatars run a distributed intelligence that calls itself Singularitar. The wetware in a sentient creature's mind is just large enough to hold and run an instance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">When Trees Attack</a>:<ul><li> Sapient trees look like normal trees until they reveal their true nature, with faces and limblike branches. With effort, they can uproot themselves and walk about, but usually only when no one is looking. Although the fighting trees in Quadling Country of Oz are among the most well known, many Magic recursions have intelligent trees.</li><li> The veridials of Ardeyn are intelligent, animate trees with several massive, rootlike legs and two nasty claw-branches. Veridials spend most of their time asleep and indistinguishable from normal trees. They appreciate the gentle sounds of nature, but any sound foreign to the forest or anything excessively loud will awake a very angry veridial.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoEvenNeedsABrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoEvenNeedsABrain">Who Even Needs a Brain?</a>: The brain of Microcosmica can never be found at all. This mythical organ, if it exists at all, would presumably be something like the god of Microcosmica.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">Wicked Witch</a>: Hazel Jenkins, the owner of the House on the Hill in Halloween, turns caught trick-or-treaters into slaves, food or test subjects, and fashions monstrous creatures. Some covens in the Forest Hills are also looking for fresh meat for their stew pot, as does the hungry, cannibalistic witch of Gingerbread House.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange">Winds of Destiny, Change</a>: Calamity has the ability to affect probability in his own favour. He can't usually decide what's exactly going to happen; instead, he concentrates on the task at hand, and that's when his luck kicks in, which is probably bad luck for anyone attempting to stop him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>: The heights of psychic ability are too much for some in Atom Nocturne to manage. Their minds collapse inward into evil knots where self-aggrandisement and personal gain push everything else aside, including any shred of moral behaviour. They are known as the Fallen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatPerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatPerks">With Great Power Comes Great Perks</a>: The supervillainess Nightmare Chill seems most concerned with living the good life. She always says that if she scores big enough, she might retire her name and take up yachting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel">Womb Level</a>: Microcosmica is the interior of a human-sized living creature, but recursors who visit it are translated down to the size of bacteria.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldInTheSky">World in the Sky</a>: Mandala Zero is a collection of city skyscrapers and smaller buildings, each floating on a separate mote of crumbling earth that holds the building's framing. The buildings float through an apparent starry void.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWormThatWalks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWormThatWalks">The Worm That Walks</a>: A collective is a mass of psionic grubs worming through a slush of salty ooze. Individually the grubs are harmless vermin, but together they're a sentient entity, a single psionic mind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>:<ul><li> The Citadel of the Harrowing is surrounded by a shambling city of bandits, raiders, ruffians, slavers, glass pirates and worse. Without the rule of law to tame the passions of the residents, the Citadel is a dangerous place to live.</li><li> Shome is a lawless city of dangerous criminals and mercenaries. Its black markets make all manner of rare and obscure goods available, particularly those that the major factions of Ruk don&#146;t want to be available.</li><li> Shome criminal organisations thrive in the Shadowed City, offering various illegal items, favours and other services that most citizens of Harmonious would rather know nothing about.</li><li> The hidden spaceport of Haranbar in the jungle planet of Aranolis in Rebel Galaxy is a hideout for smugglers and criminals looking to lay low from the eye of the Grand Imperium. Press gangs, pickpockets and bandits are common, and smart travellers watch their back at all times.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">You Killed My Father</a>: The father of Maria Simons, a Defense Grey Investigation Service agent in New York Grey, was once abducted by the greys before they publicly revealed their presence to the world. He never recovered from the experience and eventually took his own life. As a result, Maria can be a bit quick with a pistol when investigating secret grey activities.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">You Kill It, You Bought It</a>: The heads of a hydra's victims with useful bits of knowledge or skill are incorporated onto a hydra.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters</a>: In New York Grey, radical group of humans calling themselves the Green Hills Society believes they must rise up and eject the greys from Earth, the sooner the better, and no matter the cost. This ideology makes them terrorists, though many human sympathisers secretly agree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>:<ul><li> Zed America is one of several recursions that hosted a zombie apocalypse. Most of America now belongs to the shambling hordes of the undead, except for the rare high-security fortress enclaves and lonely keeps where the American way of life continues.</li><li> A zombie outbreak struck Castle One some time in the past, leading to the abandonment of the recursion. In the aftermath, Castle One remains a sealed, zombie-infested place.</li></ul></li></ul><hr>
