Some characters and creatures, while not MDC, are able to take a little mega-damage anyway due to having massive amounts of SDC, such as Titan Juicers and weaker True Giants.

The <em>Free Quebec</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> and a couple other books tried to address this by creating variant Glitter Boy models which serve various functions, but most remain heavy support units, designed primarily to be used in large-unit maneuvers.

Unfortunately, the implants also wear down the mental stability of the recipient, hence the nickname "Crazies" (a less common nickname is "Momma's Boys", in reference to the M.O.M. implants, but it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">unwise to call a Crazy that to his face</a>).

It's a barren planet with surface temperatures ranging from 90-150 degrees Fahrenheit, oceans of lava rather than water, and rampant volcanism. The atmosphere is so tainted with volcanic gases that it rains sulfuric acid and some sort of blazing hot sulfur-methane mixture far more often than it does water, and in some places the air is toxic enough to kill non-natives. Sometimes the sulfur-methane cocktail forms into a massive wave of fire that rolls across the landscape, incinerating everything in its path.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumDuJour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumDuJour">favored form of human enhancement</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">bionics</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Juicers</a> and Crazies (brain implants) as somewhat more-unstable technologies. That said, the technology is there and has been employed in a lot of places; it's just that nobody is doing eugenic work on humans right now, and most humans are still baseline. Some examples of genetic engineering:<ul><li> The Coalition States in particular has done some fairly impressive things with the genetic engineering of animals, creating entire races of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDetectingDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDetectingDog">Evil Detecting Dogs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Supersoldier</a> dogs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Supersoldier</a> cats of two different kinds, Chimpanzee lab assistants, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Supersoldier</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">bears</a></em>, to name a few. Aside from major toughness improvement for the "Kill" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a> and Ursa Warriors, and obviously raised intelligence, they are more of an "optimized version" then granted superpowers.</li><li> The Mutants from South America's Project Achilles, on the other hand, are what happens when you take all the brakes off a bunch of people like Lone Star. Many mutated animals are there with actual superpowers, as opposed to just the optimizations done on Lone Star animals. Ironically, the <em>most</em> powerful mutant animals are the Neo-Humans, who are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Human Subspecies</a>.</li><li> The Lemurians long ago optimized their DNA using biomantic magic, as well as adapting to an amphibious life.</li><li> There's also the Gene Splicers, amoral aliens who can be found here or there across the globe, though they're concentrated in Eastern Europe. Gene Splicers, as the name would imply, have mastered the art of genetic engineering and like tampering with it for experimental purposes. Their motivations are a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>.

Whether it's actually self-aware or conscious is anyone's guess, most of the time it seems to act more like an organic computer that's been programmed to provide for the needs of the humans living on it. For instance, when humans move into a new area, the planet starts shaping that portion of itself into a city for them to live in, and creates pockets of water and food caves nearby. Unfortunately, the fact that it seems to act on instinct means that the Unholy and his demonic minions have been able to pervert portions of the planet, bending it to their own evil will.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">Genre-Busting</a>: <em>Rifts</em> is not part of any genre, it's an amalgam of so many genres that it is practically a genre unto its own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">Genre Roulette</a>: It's hard to pick a genre that <em>Rifts</em> hasn't covered in one or more books.

He's a lesser demon who looks like a scaled humanoid with tusks coming from his lower jaw, and three eyes lined vertically. He's wearing a ten-gallon hat and other cowboy gear, and carrying a six-shooter in each hand. In this case, the trope is invoked in-universe, with the demon purposely dressing and acting in a ridiculous manner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">so that others will underestimate him</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germanic Efficiency</a>: Triax and the New German Republic have this going in full force.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOutOfJailFreeCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOutOfJailFreeCard">"Get out of Jail Free" Card</a>: The Night of Forgiveness was a general amnesty announced by the Coalition after the start of the Minion War.

They're ungodly tough and entirely invulnerable to anything meant to affect something with biology or a mind &mdash; they cannot be charmed, hypnotized or sent to sleep, or harmed by most harmful spells &mdash; and are highly resistant to physical and energy damage.

Bonus rolls are awarded if you happen to roll a 16, 17, or 18, and some classes and skills will give an attribute bonus (usually to physical attributes), but otherwise, you're stuck with what you roll. Most GMs allow house rules along the lines of D&amp;D's "roll 4D6 and discard the lowest die roll" rule. For the most part, though, attributes aren't as important in Rifts as they are in d20 games. High attributes will grant the player bonuses, though they're generally not penalized for low attributes (though it might limit the character classes you can choose from). At least until the Ultimate Edition came out, which added new rules for characters with low attributes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Hope Bringer</a>: One of the classic themes of the Glitter Boy (outside of Free Quebec and the NGR).

Until this is done, the morphworm reverts to a primal, instinct-driven beast seeking nothing more than to feed, and becomes unable to view humanoids or large mammals, even its friends as allies, as more than food. This is an issue for morphworms seeking to live in civilized society as, although they do not wish to eat their allies and regret their actions after feeding, they can do nothing to stop themselves once their hunger rises.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse">Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a>: They're in Africa.

Their favored rides are the giant reptilian ostrosaurs, but they also ride rhino-buffaloes, dinosaurs and a variety of large and normally intractable creatures.</li><li> The world of Dr'myr is home to two species associated with exotic steeds. The br'talb ride kr'talpa or "demon hounds", horned predators with whom they formed a symbiotic relationship in order to better catch shared prey and evade their common predators and share a close psychic link. Simvans, notably, are the only species beyond the br'talb who can form empathic links with demon hounds. The sky riders instead prefer flying steeds, especially the hammerhead shark-headed flying serpents and the horned insectoid beasts known as skelter bats.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Hot Scientist</a>: Invoked by the New German Republic. When Erin Tarn traveled there, she found out that her books are very popular. Also, whoever did the marketing for said books decided to portray her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">well-built</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes">knockout</a> in her early twenties.

It's intentionally created with no balance to speak of, and each power, spell, and piece of technology is written without considering how it interacts with the rest of the system. Most of the rules were initially created for other Palladium games that focused on human (or human-ish) characters: Ninjas &amp; Superspies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Robotech, etc. Since Rifts has everything from super-powered humans to giant mecha to demons to gods in it, there aren't any guidelines for, say, when your martial arts stop being effective. (6-foot human throwing a 7-foot insect with Judo? Not mentioned, but probably okay. 6-foot human throwing a 25-foot demon? Still not mentioned.) For bonus points, the rules are (intentionally?) just slightly vague. For extra special bonus points, the entire Palladium game system (of which Rifts is a member) is supposedly cross-compatible, but each particular game uses slightly different rules. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a> to the rescue! Reportedly the creator of Rifts uses house rules in his own campaign.

For unknown reasons, a being's P.P.E. is doubled at the moment of death, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a> an attractive option for evil spell casters looking to power an energy-hungry ritual. This is actually the basis for the setting, as an outgrowth of <em>Beyond the Supernatural</em>; when the nuclear war happened, the nearly-instantaneous death toll supercharged the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine">Ley Lines</a> so much that they opened up rifts to other worlds, allowing monsters to come through.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>: For all the evil monsters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>, and alien invaders roaming the land, it's the human supremacist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Coalition States</a> who are the most hated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">In universe, at least</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a>: When rolling attributes for a character, Humans have a special rule that applies only to them. If you roll a 16, 17, or 18 for any attribute, you can roll an extra die and add that amount to the total. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">As of the new Ultimate Edition of the game</a>, if you roll a 6 on that bonus die, you get to roll another extra die. This means that with enough luck, a Human character can start off with an attribute score of 30 for one or more of his stats. Note that 10-12 is considered average.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">Human Resources</a>: The "blood" of Cactus People, called their life fluid, is a sweet and highly nutritious liquid that can sustain humans and other creatures even in the absence of regular water, and which is also an excellent ingredient for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion">Healing Potions</a>.

The now-defunct Myrmidon Press was given permission to use Palladium's Megaversal Rules System in making <em>Manhunter,</em> and the <em>Rifts</em> title was tacked on almost as an afterthought. About the only parallels this game has to any other Rifts product is that magic and science exist side-by-side, and infrequent, awkward mentions of rifts in time and space suddenly appearing in the setting. The book has been out of print for a very long time, and extant copies are so rare most Rifts fans have never even heard of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens">Insectoid Aliens</a>: England is home to two such species, the dabugghs and the mantaz sectles; the former look like humans with a single arthropod body part, while the latter are straight-up gigantic mantis-like insects (although they're also warmblooded and more similar to birds in terms of internal anatomy).

Very rarely will you see it actually called simply <em>Ishpeming</em>.</li><li> Chi-Town is always referred to as a Mega-City, possibly because Siembieda didn't realize that a term already exists for cities like Chi-Town. Even later books by other authors that use the correct word (arcology) will still include "Mega-City", usually combining the two as Mega-City/arcology.

Each of these elements was put into the "race" for a reason, and the combination comes across as completely believable, so their sudden appearance doesn't make anyone suspicious.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithWater">Kill It with Water</a>: Vampires can be harmed, even killed by running water. This apparently means any water in motion. That means water hoses and squirt guns are effective weapons when vampires attack. This is less of an issue for them than it sounds, since plumbing is non-existent in most places on Rifts Earth and, while squirt guns aren't rare, they're not a dime a dozen like in real life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>: Several of the more powerful organizations on Rifts Earth, like the New German Republic and the Coalition States, have attempted to launch satellites for a variety of reasons. So far, all attempts have failed, and the assumption is that there are Pre-Rifts killer satellites programmed to destroy anything that is put in orbit. They're partly right, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWhatAboutTheAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWhatAboutTheAstronauts">But What About the Astronauts?</a> above for more details.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">Kinetic Weapons Are Just Better</a>: In general, no, but they scale up better than energy weapons do.

They're a group of colonies who rebelled against the evil Transgalactic Empire, and are waging a war to free other planets from the tyranny of the Kreeghor. Depending on how one interprets the information given on the group, they can be played as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVilified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVilified">The Revolution Will Not Be Vilified</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized">The Revolution Will Not Be Civilized</a>. Also, since the conclusion of the Siege on Tolkeen, freedom fighter/terrorist cells of surviving Tolkeen sympathizers have set up shop in the Chi-Town Burbs.</li><li> An interesting version exists in the form of the Vanguard. They are mages descended from a time when Chi-Town (head of the Coalition States) had a fledgling army of magic users. When they were booted out, they went underground and continue to fight for the Coalition to this day. Sadly, the Coalition is unaware of their existence, and even if they did, they'd shoot them dead like any other mage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blade</a>: Cyberknights and Mind Melters wield these puppies, which they can create with their minds.

While some of their experiments involve tinkering with DNA to see how a creature might have evolved under different conditions, their name comes from the fact that they like to combine genes from disparate species to do things like give people wings or tentacles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine">Ley Line</a>: <em>The</em> source of supernatural power, the cause of the cataclysm that ended civilization, and the key to a great deal of magical workings. In this setting, they are "rivers" of pure magical energy which crisscross the Earth. Even the smallest ley lines are miles long. The Coming of the Rifts was precipitated by a sudden and massive influx of magic energy, swelling the ley lines to the point that the largest can be seen by the naked eye as lines of blue glowing energy, even by day. Magic users can use ley line energy as a quick and easy source of magic energy. This is one way for wizards to pull off powerful ritual magic. Also, Techno Wizards can build devices which tap a ley line to power it. A conjunction of two or more ley lines is known as a ley line nexus.

By the time the Atlanteans had done all they could to undo the damage, the magical levels of Earth had dropped so low as to be almost non-existent, and Atlantis itself had been shunted into a pocket dimension.</li><li> See also the Ancient Nazca civilization, which managed to create entire cities out of pure magic energy.

The latter is often mixed up in human-supremacism, but not always (El Dorado, prior to joining the Coalition, welcomed D-Bee citizens despite being firmly against the use of magic).<ul><li> Japan in particular has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> essentially limited to tech-ninja clans (who don't play by the rules anyway) because of this; the main technological faction (the Republic of Japan) has little access to magic (though they're not necessarily <em>against</em> it, they don't use it) and the main magical faction (the New Empire) is firmly anti-tech. There are non-ninja factions that use both magic and technology (most notably Takamatsu), but they don't headline the book.

The Coalition wouldn't have hated Tolkeen quite so much if they weren't so close to Chi-Town.</li><li> Much to the Coalition's ongoing annoyance, the New German Republic has not actually outlawed magic. They don't see the point. Their well-educated, technology-centric society simply doesn't have much interest in it. Why summon a demon to serve you (and risk getting eaten) when perfectly reliable robots can be bought or leased from Triax?

Mystics are mages who develop their ability to use magic through psionic development and have access to both Major Psionics and magic; they're considered mages in North America, but interestingly, they're seen as more like psychics in Europe (and thus they're the most accepted magical OCC in the New German Republic and the New Soviet).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>: Outside of the more puritanical factions, most people use magic and technology fairly interchangeably, alternating between them and using them boost each other as needed.

The Cyberworks Aerospace Networks likewise holds this position on the Moon, where their moonbase was the first offworld community to declare nationhood after the Great Cataclysm.

Power armor/vehicular combat training and the appropriate suit/vehicle stacks a couple more on top of that.)

Wooden stakes to the heart will not kill a vampire, however, but only put it in a state of suspended animation. Remove the stake, and within 15 seconds the vampire will be back to full health, hungry as hell, and biting at the neck of anyone within arm's reach. However, once it has been incapacitated by a stake, the vampire is vulnerable, and can be killed by separating the head from the body and burning both to ash.</li><li> There's also three varieties of vampire: Master, Secondary, and Wild.

The Amazon R.C.C. is superior to a human being in every way, and surpasses even True Atlanteans by a country mile, while still looking human. And most of the Felinoid cat-people are powerful MDC fighters with many options in combat.</li><li> South American Biomancers' powers are almost laughably weak compared to Lemurian Gene-Mages (a couple dozen worldbooks later). Some of this is justified by Lemuria having more advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> than the Jungle Elves, but that doesn't really explain Lemurian mages having over <em>three times</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> of the South American variety.</li><li> <em>Triax and the NGR</em>, a book with tons of advanced hardware, released an updated version in the 2000s with universally-better gear.</li><li> Kevin Siembieda, humorously, actually <em>really hates</em> this tendency, and has blamed it on some of his early writers (who apparently didn't get edited properly). He is quoted in many World Books as hating the "Power Gaming" aspect of the hobby, believing that versatility and roleplaying are more important. A very frustrated rant was included in <em>The Federation of Magic</em> book about how fans were complaining about Mages being "wimpy" &mdash; he disagreed...

Some Atlanteans go even farther, covering their bodies in magic tattoos that can conjure magic weapons, create animal or monster companions, or grant them other supernatural powers. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Splugorth</a> have also discovered the secrets of magic tattoos, and create their own T-Men to be sold as slaves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a>: Vampires are inherently drawn toward evil, and Master Vampires are always evil &mdash; full stop.

One quick adventure based around the artifact is basically a gag, where the adventurers hear of an old man who has The Mobius.

One notable case is the book <em>Mystic Russia</em>. Siembieda poured over many volumes of Russian Folklore to create the magical creatures and mortal magicians in the book, to ensure an authentically Russian flavor.

Their giant robots, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank">the Spider-Skull Crawler</a>, also carry this motif frequently, as do vehicles such as the Death's Head Armored Transport.

They feed on the blood and liquified organs of mammals, and Spinne females are much larger than the males. They're divided into two distinct bloodlines: the Starke are descended from web-builders and tend to be even-tempered, staid and clinical, while the Schnellig, descended from hunting spiders, are much more aggressive and outgoing.

In the field, given how vulnerable a human is without MDC bodyarmor, it's rare to see someone take off more than a helmet or faceplate.<ul><li> The Glitter Boy class, however, does mention that the character should at the very least get out of his suit and exercise for a couple hours every day to avoid muscle atrophy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Cosmo Knights</a> from the Phaseworld/Three Galaxies setting are this played completely straight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable">The Unpronounceable</a>: The Xiticix race comes pretty damn close.

In an essay he wrote about naming things, he flat out called it a "terrible name". The name is so unwieldy that Siembieda's father referred to them as "City Chicks". For those of you who are wondering, the correct pronounciation is "zeye-TICK-icks".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">The Usual Adversaries</a>:<ul><li> Tolkeen was a peaceful, accepting, integrated kingdom in a mainly magic-based society.

Similarly, Free Quebec was actually a member of the Coalition, but felt they were getting sidelined, possibly lied to, and quite frankly getting tired of having their doctrines dictated to, by the Coalition's leaders. All their suspicious were absolutely true, resulting in a costly war between what should have been natural allies. Even for those who think the Coalition might be right, they're hard to love.</li><li> At the same time, Chi-Town (founder and seat of power for the Coalition) was pretty tolerant and open (they even had their own magic military unit at the time) until Nostrous Dunscon decided to declare war on them and fling hellish magical <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> would be total flops, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">The Room</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigli">Gigli</a></em> would have people lining up for repeat viewings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter">Vampire Hunter</a>: Reid's Rangers is a famous group of vampire hunters operating in the American Southwest.

Based on designs the Coalition had been sitting on for years, they were finally mass-produced for use by the Dog Boys, since the human supremacist Coalition was wary about handing guns to mutant animals. They proved so popular that they're now a standard part of just about every character's starting equipment and available just about anywhere that claims to be civilization. Pretty much every conceivable kind of bladed weapon has been made into a vibroblade, from knives to halberds. Many suits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>, and even some suits of body armor come equipped with vibroblades built into the arms for melee combat. Curiously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">according to the sourcebooks</a> vibroblades don't actually vibrate the blade but are surrounded by a vibrating <em>energy field</em>, making them a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blade</a> with a solid core.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>:<ul><li> There's a whole lot of these in Rifts, but the biggest one is probably Emperor Prosek. Within the Coalition States, he is considered to be incapable of doing any wrong. He gave a live televised speech announcing that he was plunging the nation into a series of unprovoked wars, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> against one of their own states, and he was cheered on for it.

The sourcebook mentions that even Alastair Dunscon, heir to the "True" Federation of magic, only controls about 15-20% at any given time, and even his father was only able to rally a little more than half for his war against Chi-Town.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">We Can Rebuild Him</a>: One of the most successful tactics the Coalition has in the Minion War is to take soldiers who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">Only Mostly Dead</a> and immediately shunt them into the CS Combat Cyborg program, allowing them to return experienced soldiers to the battlefield and mitigating the effects of the Minions' attrition warfare.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDidntStartTheFuhrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDidntStartTheFuhrer">We Didn't Start the F&uuml;hrer</a>:<ul><li> One downplayed example: Some of the atrocities committed by Spain in South America were actually driven by the undead <em>ellal</em> in the bodies of dead Spaniards. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">But not all</a>.</li><li> A journal snippet indicates that Hitler may have been a puppet of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Aerihman Clan of Atlanteans, who were trying to take control of Earth for their return</span>. The journal in question is ambiguous enough that it's a maybe, though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseLasersInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseLasersInTheFuture">We Will Use Lasers in the Future</a>: Most modern weapons are energy-based, and there's a variety of them. Pulse, ion, plasma and particle weapons are all a thing. Lasers in particular are common enough that there's anti-laser armor, and anti-anti-laser-armor lasers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Before joining up with the human-supremacist Coalition, the population of El Dorado was 15% D-Bee, and the local D-Bees lived without prejudice. After <em>Coalition War Campaign</em>, El Dorado had accepted Coalition membership and the D-Bees were...never mentioned at all in future books. You'd think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">unpersoning</a> 15% of your population might cause a little unrest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMightHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMightHaveBeen">What Might Have Been</a>: In the early days of the Coalition, magic was a valid military and civil tool, but was abandoned after a brutal war with the Federation of Magic.

This, combined with the fact that it happened at midnight during the Winter Solstice, caused the ley lines to surge with a level of energy that hadn't been felt on Earth since the disappearance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. The instantaneous death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">several million people</a>, their own mystic energy pouring into the ley lines, resulted in the magical equivalent of an overloaded circuit, creating the Coming of the Rifts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>: It's a deliberate theme in the game. All the forms of human augmentation come with a price tag. Crazies, as the name would imply, become more and more mentally unbalanced as time goes on due to the implants in their brains, Juicers only live on average five years after taking the augmentation (provided they don't die by violent means first), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsWillEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsWillEatYourSoul">cyborgs find themselves becoming removed from humanity as they lose their human bodies</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsFromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsFromOuterSpace">Wizards from Outer Space</a>: Most especially in the <em>Three Galaxies</em>, where the United Worlds of Warlock is a major power and a number of other factions such as the various Splugorth domains and the Transgalactic Empire also make extensive use of magic. There are even a sizeable number of spells specifically designed to be useful in space.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassPeopleAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassPeopleAreMorons">Working-Class People Are Morons</a>:<ul><li> And the Coaltion States are just fine with that, since they need <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> is actively encouraged and CS propaganda (all delivered in audio-video format or live speeches naturally) goes so far as to suggest that things like reading can lead to mental instability. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutedIntellectuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutedIntellectuals">Persecuted Intellectuals</a> are therefore the norm, except for the CS technocrat elite, who thanks to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a> (see above) are kept safely separated from the proles that live in the lower levels of CS fortress-cities.</li><li> This is a major point of contention between the CS and its erstwhile "allies" Free Quebec and the New German Republic, both of whom believe in having an educated working class and prefer to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">cultural pressure</a> to validate their more morally-dubious positions such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. The Germans find this especially problematic, because they have no idea how to hold a conversation with people from the CS, since the latter are generally so uneducated and pumped full of propaganda by German standards that even topics like history or politics are beyond their understanding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldTree">The World Tree</a>:<ul><li> Millennium Trees are immense plants &mdash; generally as tall as hills &mdash; found growing in places of intense magical power, typically where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine">Ley Lines</a> intersect. They never wilt or go dormant, leading some to speculate that their lives work on cycles centuries or millennia in length, and as long as the ley line energy is strong enough they can grow lush and green anywhere, including the middle of scorching deserts or barren tundras. They're found worldwide, but most are in England. They also grow complex, hollow and perforated boles large enough to serve as apartment buildings and can create supernatural storms and send them rocketing down their ley lines.</li><li> <em>Pantheons of the Megaverse</em> has Yggdrasil, <em>the</em> World Tree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>. The section on Yggdrasil includes a description of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">godlike</a> powers a player character can be granted by impaling himself on the tree for nine days (a la Odin). As one can imagine, the rolls required to survive the ordeal are pretty rough.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWreckingWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWreckingWave">World-Wrecking Wave</a>: The Great Cataclysm which kick-started the whole setting. A nuclear war, during a planetary alignment, on the Winter Solstice, equaled a massive burst of magical energy akin to millions of human sacrifices. Every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine">Ley Line</a> on Earth surged with more power than they'd had in tens of thousands of years, creating a catastrophic surge of natural disasters... which meant more people died, which meant more power flooded into the ley lines, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">which meant more disasters</a>. Ninety percent of humanity was killed, literally overnight. In the end, humanity was left standing in the ruins of civilization, with aliens, other-dimensional beings, and demons all dragged onto Earth by the newly-opened Rifts, wondering what the hell just happened.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames">Wreathed in Flames</a>:<ul><li> The Burster class. They are psychics who specialize in pyrokinesis. They get their name for their most impressive psychic power, which is to surround themselves in a flaming aura. There's also a mutant jaguar race in the first <em>South America</em> book which can do this.</li><li> The Kittani, an alien race who enjoy making plasma weapons, have created a technological variant of the Burster's ability. They're mostly used by races/classes who are resistant to fire (such as Bursters) because the Kittani never quite worked out how to keep the person wearing the plasma harness from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">burning up</a> while using it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">As one might expect</a>, Rifts Earth is fairly overflowing with these.<ul><li> The ones that get the most press are the 'Burbs of Chi-Town. They are an unofficial sprawl of shanty towns and slums surrounding the arcology of Chi-Town like a besieging army. The 'Burbs are filled with rejects, criminals, and scum. The older areas, typically those closest to Chi-Town, have been around long enough that they're become fairly affluent communities, and are mostly populated with people on the waiting list to become Coalition citizens. The Coalition refuses to recognize any authority that might pop up in the 'Burbs, and usually only makes its presence known when it instigates a purge to wipe out trouble too big to ignore (and they don't care who they step on along the way). The Coalition does employ some Dead Boys to patrol trouble areas to keep an eye on things, but these "peacekeepers" are completely biased towards humans, and mostly corrupt as well. It's not uncommon for one to step over the body of a dead D-Bee with a knife in his back without so much as a "What happened here?"</li><li> In the description of Ciudad Juarez, it's explicitly stated that the place is like the cantina scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> throughout the city. One illustration in particular shows a policeman walking his beat, casually stepping over a guy who has been stabbed while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">ignoring all the mayhem happening around him</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>: Dragon hatchlings used as player characters are usually <strong>very</strong> young. There's a random roll table for determining a dragon hatchling's age at the start of a campaign. The oldest possible age is 48 days old. The youngest is six hours old. This, as well as the fact that dragons don't become adults (and become more powerful by a couple orders of magnitude) until they're 500, was likely done to make it harder for players to make adult dragon characters via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>:<ul><li> This is how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Xiticix</a> handle threats.</li><li> The Coalition tried this in the opening months of the Siege on Tolkeen. They discovered to their misfortune that rolling over a small village with a few practitioners of magic, and attacking an entire Kingdom composed almost entirely of mages, are two very different things.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
