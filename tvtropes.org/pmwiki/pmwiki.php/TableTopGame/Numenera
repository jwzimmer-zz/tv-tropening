Although the current civilization is at a medieval level, the eight previous civilizations have left behind innumerable technological artefacts &mdash; machines collectively called <em>numenera</em>. To most people, the numenera are curious remnants of the past that are rarely understood, sometimes useful, often dangerous and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw">usually thought of as magic</a>.

As the player's guide itself says: "The key to playing Numenera is the story. The way to "win" this game is to come away with a great tale." Using the Cypher system, characters are created by having the player fill in three blanks in a simple sentence: "I am a (<em>descriptor</em>) (<em>type</em>) who (<em>focus</em>)." The descriptor is an adjective that describes the character, the type is the character class, and the focus is a verb that also describes the character in some way. Each of the three variables have their own effects on the character; for instance, a <em>Tough</em> <em>Glaive</em> who <em>Rides the Lightning</em> gains various bonuses to defensive stats, is skilled at physical combat, and can control lightning in various ways. Every challenge in the game, including combat, is treated the same way mechanically: a d20 is rolled against a set difficulty level, and if the die beats it, the player succeeds at the task. The player can influence the difficulty level by expending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> can intrude on player actions and cause unforeseen difficulties; the intention is to allow storytelling to flow organically from the system in this way.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A series of sourcebooks titled <em>Arcana of the Ancients</em>, funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign, serves as an official conversion of <em>Numenera</em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 5th Edition.</p><p>Has a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.numenera.com">website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This game provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedMine">Abandoned Mine</a>: Guran's old bauble mines are no longer used and are firmly boarded up at each of their two main entrances.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor">Absent-Minded Professor</a>: A textbook case in the form of Sir Arthour Torein, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATrueStoryInMyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATrueStoryInMyUniverse">in-universe author</a> of the (out-of-universe) <em>Technology Compendium</em>.

If visitors use some kind of marking technique, the marks often turn up missing or moved, due to the schemes of the pyths that occur on a level of reality that most creatures can only sense indirectly.

With its triple walls (made of redstone, limnelwood and electrified synth), interconnected walkways between buildings, and guard towers at every corner, Jyrek might be one of the best-protected places in the Steadfast.</li><li> Urzat Zarteri is a fortress-city built on a high plateau and surrounded by a tall wall of artificial stone. The place is stark and functional, its primary function being defence.</li><li> Arxil is surrounded by a 61 m tall wall that incorporates some of the surrounding terrain (or perhaps the terrain has incorporated the ancient wall), although the city itself is only about a quarter of the area enclosed by the wall.</li><li> There are still fully functional satellites orbiting the Earth, only reachable by means of teleportation or space flight. Because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> setting, a satellite sitting in orbit is functionally a nigh-impregnable fortress.

This means that visitors must practice exceptionally strict control over their imaginations, lest they accidentally allow the concept of their own existence to be corrupted.

Your digital dataform can visit pseudo-geographical locations called nodes and their roomlike frames, each of which might have different environments and qualities. The Aeon Priests who study it believe that much of the datasphere was built by physical beings who wanted using it to be a familiar experience, so the datasphere was designed to allow physical beings to interact with the virtual world in a physical-seeming manner.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>: <em>Everywhere</em>. A few major NPCs have cybernetic parts, and a couple are essentially just brains-with-life-support in metal shells. The character focus <em>"Fuses Flesh and Steel"</em> allows players to be subtly biomechanical or openly cybernetic, and grants significant boosts to the character's Might and Speed, along with innate Armor. Cyborgs require regular repairs and maintenance however; unlike normal characters, they cannot rely on Recovery rolls alone.

And even with tech that provides immunity to radiation, they must beware of the catastrophic storms, where ocean spray and clouds above are sometimes hard to distinguish, and which are deadly whether visitors are floating on the sea or inside a submersible.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefaceOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefaceOfTheMoon">Deface of the Moon</a>: Earth's moon is smaller-looking than it would be in our time, thanks to having a wider orbit (with corresponding effects on day length), and sometimes a wide green band can be seen around its equator.

Anyone else entering a domain would be giving complete power over themselves&#151;how they look, how they react, what they think, and even the continuity of their own existence&#151;to the domain owner.

New frames, either singly or as part of many making up an entire node, find their way to Tourbillion to be consumed by the deletion zone in the center after weeks, months, or years of orbit. Nearly anything might be found in Tourbillion, but most last for only a few weeks or months before being deleted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a>: A full build focus, "Wields Two Weapons at Once".

It has a reputation for being infested with dangerous spirits and monstrous beasts &mdash; it's a fact that it's inhabited by jiraskars, ferocious predators resembling colorful tyrannosaurs &mdash; and as such has been completely uninhabited for most of its history. Recently, Navarene has begun settling it and building towns and roads within it, which has brought it in conflict with the spider-like culovas that live within it and viciously ward off trespassers.</li><li> The Ba-Adenu Forest is an enormous wilderness in the Beyond, large enough to be divided in three distinct biomes &mdash; dry forest, jungle and muddy swampland.

The larders are always full of excellent food and drink, and the environmental conditions are always comfortable. Sleep is always restful.

Unless you have an army on your side and are willing to lose a large portion of your forces, fighting a dread destroyer is unwise.</li><li> Warstrikers are giant war machines difficult to control or influence.

No one develops new ideas, tools or methods. Everyone seems content with the way things are, and no one can remember when things were significantly different. A thousand years ago, the iltegu tried to spur the people out of this stagnation, but failed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity">Mega City</a>: The city of U-i-Nstor is home to only a million people but stretches for 483 km from end to end, because it is very spread out, with huge tracts of open land between city sections, vast parks and expansive campuses of large buildings. U-i-Nstor might be regarded as many cities in close proximity, but is united under a single government, a single lawkeeping force, and a mass-transit system that ties everything together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalPictureProjector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalPictureProjector">Mental Picture Projector</a>: The mind imager shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld">Mental World</a>: The Thon Iridescence is a massive psychic construct containing millions of realms constructed of dreamlike psychic matter, home to quintillions of individual creatures living out immortal lives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantPrince">Merchant Prince</a>: When the royal line died out, power in Draolis was seized by a council of wealthy plutocrats who didn't want another hereditary monarchy to take control.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">Military Academy</a>: The Knights of Durranet use knowledge of the numenera and extensive physical training to create exceptional scouts, spies, and officers.

It ceased functioning long ago, however, and was already immobile and half-buried when its current inhabitants found it centuries ago.</li><li> The city of Joira is built on, in and beneath the carapace of the granthu, a titanic crustacean that lives deep beneath the sea. The creature itself migrates along an endless circuit of the abyss, periodically coming close to shore before heading back into the deep, and the Joirans have adapted to this perambulatory nature and periodically trade with other underwater cities as Joira passes them by.</li><li> The Scuttling City is an octopus settlement off the coast of the Lands of the Dawn. It consists of a large number of spheres constantly shifting in position respect to each other, and which have mechanical tentacles on their undersides. The city is always in motion, using the tentacles of whichever spheres currently happen to be low enough to move across the sea floor.</li><li> The town of Umdera is periodically disassembled and hauled to a new location where it is rebuilt. The longest the elders recall the village ever staying in one place is ten years and the briefest just a few months.</li><li> Several living cities crawl, float, or fly across the landscape of the Liminal Shore. The Windborne City of Nera is a flying example and always on the move, stretching across the sky in a vast train visible from a few hundred miles away on the surface.

Little grows in Vralk, and what lives there consists of vicious monsters, poisonous animals and deadly plants.

Nothing grows in Dessanedi, and only a few scavenger birds live there.</li><li> The ground in Sor Rumnar is often stark, twisted (often impossibly), and filled with chaotic and unexpected chasms and ridges. Earthquakes and weird weather are routine. Creatures found nowhere else haunt this dread land, and familiar creatures are perverted, with extra limbs, eyes or heads. For most people in the Lands of the Dawn, Sor Rumnar is more myth than reality.

The one exception are humans, which are still practically unchanged. However, the game hints that humans have not been around the whole time and somehow remained unaffected by evolution, but actually only reappeared a few thousand or million years ago.

This crest also contains an organ that helps them fly, but no one is really sure how it works. They are intelligent and can read minds, and are extremely long-lived.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">Our Ghosts Are Different</a>:<ul><li> Living biological creatures that pass through the Vendav Ring usually disappear, but sometimes their ghosts show up later, flickering into and out of reality like two-dimensional projections, unable to make a sound or affect anything solid, but sometimes cognisant of the events occurring around them.</li><li> The eulm are incorporeal creatures that inhabit and are the namesake of the Haunted Cloud, because they seem very much like ghosts. They might appear within a starfaring vessel passing through the cloud and take up residence within the same space as an existing creature or object.

They wear no clothing, use bone weapons and make no shelters, instead burrowing beneath the ground by day, and will eat anything they can catch &mdash; and are cannibals to boot, eating both human travelers and their own young, elders and feeble ones to survive in the waste they call home.</li><li> Syzygy ghouls are abhumans who feed upon the dead, and spend almost as much time beneath the ground as corpses. Their bodies are hairless and so porcelain-smooth that their faces are sometimes mistaken for emotionless masks. Syzygy ghouls come to the surface at night to gather humanoid remains or steal those recently interred from their graves, and are said to know what any of their past meals knew. They are later revealed to hail from Dhizrend, a dimension filled only with corpses, and to be ruled by an elite that does not feed on corpses and instead dines on living human captives.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Our Gods Are Different</a>: The Ninth World has many gods. Some are mere constructs of faith with no substance, like a tribe of abhumans worshipping fire. A few are mysterious objects, usually numenera items with strange abilities. Others are entities left behind by the prior worlds, sleeping, dreaming, half mad, or desperate to fulfil their ancient purpose. Others are powerful contemporary mortals, from advanced extraterrestrials, ultraterrestrials, mutants, to humanoids. Yet others are so strange as to be uncategorisable. Philosophers and Aeon Priests debate whether any of them truly deserve being called gods, but generations of intelligent beings have worshipped gods with no proof of their existence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreWeird">Our Monsters Are Weird</a>: Blue-skinned mandibled abhumans addicted to increasingly-difficult murders, white-skinned humanoids with no eyes and far too many mouths, flying snakes made of electricity, purple tetrahedrons that refuse to shut up or understand that people might not be interested in playing...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Our Orcs Are Different</a>: Everything you need to know about Margr in five words: goat-men with orcish souls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Our Vampires Are Different</a>: A gaunt humanoid creature, possibly a mutant, haunts the Ba-Adenu Forest, draining the blood of its victims and leaving their desiccated corpses for others to find.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Our Werewolves Are Different</a>: For some reason, some technological strangeness creates what can only be called a bog-standard fantasy horror werewolf.

Human civilization &mdash; and likely the human species &mdash; has only recently reemerged, and is both very fragmentary and constantly in the shadow of the ruins of the prior worlds and the plethora of technologies, entities and creatures left over from their reigns. Even in civilized lands such as the Steadfast, Lostrei or Augur-Kala, settlements are often very isolated and separated by vast stretches of wilderness home to ferocious predators, incomprehensible and usually dangerous machines, vicious abhuman raiders, and good old-fashioned bandits; it's very common for distinct towns to have very unusual quirks not shared by others or to even be unaware of their nation's nominal capital. In the wildernesses of the Beyond, villages and cities are often tiny islands of civilization in vast seas of dangerous, uncharted land, and having arisen in complete isolation tend to be wildly different from one another &mdash; one town might be home to peaceful farmers, the next one over to insane cannibals, the next to exotic people riding strange machines, and the next one still not even home to humans.</li><li> The Gloaming is an <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk">Alderson disk<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a flat habitable structure built around a star placed within a hole in its center, and the text puts a great deal of emphasis on the impacts of its immense scale.

They can speak in the native language of whomever they talk to, but their explanations for things rarely make sense, and the questions they ask seem unrelated to anything going on around them. Philethis are meant to be an enigma: players should never fully understand them, and if they believe that they do, something should happen to show that they are wrong.</li><li> A nameless man lives in Tuleer's understory among the lux, though they give him a wide berth, whispering that he is Zhoh cursed. He lives alone and rarely emerges. When he does, he never shows his face, hiding it under a scarlet mask. Both human and lux children say that he is so hideously scarred that one look at his face would kill one alike.</li><li> Enigma, called as such by the other members of the Four, is a creature that defies understanding, except that it shares a passion for games with its colleagues. However, nothing it says ever makes sense.

They prefer lairs enshrouded by darkness, such as a dark cave near a well-travelled path where they can string their webs to trap prey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>: The ruling council of Milave does little but bicker over petty matters while the Pytharon Empire grows in military might. If war does come, this loose union is likely to collapse, each state fighting for itself and no other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWeather">Weird Weather</a>:<ul><li> The welkerwind is a fierce, angry blow that storms down off the Black Riage to the Slant Milieu almost constantly, day in and day out, to the point that the trees bend sideways, the mountains point their tops toward the ground, and creatures become stooped and hunched.</li><li> The Westwind is a corkscrewed tornado that constantly moves in the Caecilian Jungle and carries trees, animals and all manner of debris, changing its size depending on what it holds.</li><li> When the winds rise in the Jagged Wastes, they gather the glass shards on the ground and carry them along like tiny razors and needles. After such a storm, one can found the skeletons of unlucky travellers, covered in tattered, bloody flesh.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareBody">Wetware Body</a>: Ghru are humans with machine minds. When a ghru child is born, its brain is ritually removed and replaced with a biomechanical brain built by the ghru in a processing plant. Ghru brains are designed with knowledge and skills already in them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenDimensionsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenDimensionsCollide">When Dimensions Collide</a>: Transdimensional bleed allows emotions, memes, sounds, smells, light, visions, and other intangible things to seep into an affected dimension from one or more origin dimensions. Bleed can be intermittent and minor, or as in the case of certain fixed, small areas (like the Titanic Ridge), constant and sometimes significant, resulting in actual objects, organisms, structures, landforms, and even variant cosmic laws bleeding from one dimension to another. This sort of bleed is actively dangerous for creatures native to all affected dimensions&#151;some find their possessions, structures, and even themselves fading away into some other dimension, and others must deal with ultraterrestrials appearing from thin air.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">When Trees Attack</a>: At night, the elders (a species of rooted trees) of Trytherhon animate, burrow up from the ground, and hunt vermin (including humans), if any happen to overstay their welcome.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWilderness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWilderness">Wild Wilderness</a>: The Beyond. Far less settled than the Steadfast, with fewer roads and paths and vast stretches of wilderness between population centers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace">Won the War, Lost the Peace</a>: Thaemor was once part of a three-way war between Navarene, Draolis and Malevich until claimed as a kingdom by Goldguard Landon, a fearsome warrior who knew everything about how to defend a region from multiple enemies but absolutely nothing about running a kingdom himself. Under his rule, Thaemor's borders were always well protected, but its residents and places within were not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos">World of Chaos</a>: Although the Ninth World is a weird and dangerous place, it is mostly grounded in Earth-like physics. Even when the numenera creates a localized change to those parameters, the result is usually just a variation of a constant. In contrast, the datasphere is an entirely different and even weirder realm that operates under its own laws of reality, where laws of physics can be turned on and off like a light switch, distances are meaningless because information travels at nearly the speed of light, and perception is what the network transmits directly into the explorer's mind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWormThatWalks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWormThatWalks">The Worm That Walks</a>:<ul><li> Naiadans are a species of beings whose bodies are entirely composed of thousands of tiny creatures called dyremmi, all acting together to form a larger individual being. There are also naiadapts, the descendants of humans who modified themselves or who were modified to have colonies of dyremmi living in their bodies and acting as extensions of their beings. Both naiadans and naiadapts have the ability to alter their bodies and abilities by simply removing some of the dyremmi currently making them up and exchanging them for new ones carrying a desired trait, altering themselves by manipulating the balance of their component creatures. "Wild" dyremmi also exist, some of which are reported to have developed individual intelligence and see the naiadans and naiadapts as horrific conglomerations that must be destroyed to free their "enslaved" dyremmi.</li><li> Each clure is a colony of tiny creatures, all dwelling within a humanoid-shaped, transparent field of force.</li><li> The massive, waving yellow shapes billowing across the sky of New Yenth are not clouds; they are membranes filled with buoyant gas created by colonies of tiny insects that live inside, called dalds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Ingwald is a town of cutthroats and thieves. The de facto ruler of Ingwald is a lattimor named Gravish-Morel, who commands a band of river pirates that operate on the Welbyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>: Transdimensional portal mouths may deposit users in Surynx. These connections can last a few days, but sometimes only hours or even minutes, which can strand visitors in Surynx.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>: The Whispering World described in <em>Into the Outside</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a> where the Ninth World was devastated by a nanite plague that converts humans into "whispers": biomechanical dopplegangers that do not need to eat or breathe whose only purpose is to convert remaining humans into whispers by shouting a trigger phrase that activates the nanites in their person. It's speculated that the nanites are a weapon meant to quickly raise an army and that the whispers are waiting for orders that will never come, instead falling back on the default "make more whispers" protocol.</li></ul><hr>
