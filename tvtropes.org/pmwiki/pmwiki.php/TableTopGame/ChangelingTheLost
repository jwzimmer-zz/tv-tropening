The player characters, and many non-player character Changelings, are those who managed to fight, sneak, run, or trick their way back to freedom and the mortal world, but even when they return they bear the scars of their experience. Their very bodies have been changed into inhuman shapes. Their eyes have been opened so that they can see the truth of things, but they are also beset by hallucinations and tricks of perception. Worst of all is the constant, nagging worry: <em>what if I never escaped? What if this is all a trick... or if I was <strong>allowed</strong> to leave?</em></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Even if it isn't the bleakest thing White Wolf has included in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> (that honor goes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em>), it is almost certainly among the most melancholic and a stark contrast to its idealistic predecessor. There is no redemption, no way to go back to what you once were. The True Fae are infinite, their sorcery unstoppable, and their appetites impossible to slake. The Changelings can either resume their old lives knowing that they could be helping but aren't, or they can take on their new lives, safe in the knowledge that their endeavors will be at best a moist towelette on the raging bonfire of the Fae. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">If, by some miracle,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">they do become powerful enough to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie">truly take on the True Fae, the results aren't pretty.</a> On the other hand, there is a deep emphasis on relationships, interconnection, and <em>wonder</em> that isn't there in other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> games. Being only slightly better than humans, Changelings must rely on others&mdash;their Motley, their Freehold, their Entitlement&mdash;to help them take on most threats and maintain their hold on what sanity remains to them. In addition, several sourcebooks note that for all the horrors of the Changeling existence, they also experience incredible beauty and fantastic marvels that most mortals can never see.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Changeling was the second "limited cycle" game after Promethean, with a set number of sourcebooks, but proved popular enough that the line got extended for a few more books. The original five sourcebooks shared the same "seasonal" motif as the Changelings themselves: <em>Rites of Spring</em> gives more details regarding the specifics of Changeling life, the Hedge, and Fae magic, <em>Lords of Summer</em> elaborates on each seasonal Court, its place in a Freehold, and the noble Entitlements Changelings can join, <em>Autumn Nightmares</em> gives specifics on enemies and antagonists a Changeling might face, <em>Winter Masques</em> describes the Seemings and Kiths in more detail, as well as listing new potential Kiths and Courts from around the globe, and <em>Equinox Road</em> gives rules for high-powered and endgame play, including the dread truth behind the origins of the True Fae. The secondary sourcebooks were <em>Swords at Dawn,</em> which gives examples of change, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality">Narrative Causality</a>, and war amongst Changelings, <em>Dancers in the Dusk,</em> which describes endings, dreams, nightmares and fate, and <em>Grim Fears,</em> part of the Night Horrors mini-line of World of Darkness antagonists, focused on Fae-themed monsters and enemies.</p><p>There have also been some PDF supplements: a set of <em>Ready-Made PCs</em>, <em>Goblin Markets</em>, a guide to those strange, peculiar markets where virtually anything is for sale, if you're willing to pay the price, and <em>Victorian Lost</em>, exploring changelings in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">Victorian Britain</a>.</p><p>As of GenCon 2014, a 2nd edition of Changeling was announced, eventually being released on January 16th, 2019.</p><p><span class="asscaps">The various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Splat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Splat">Splats</a> of Changeling are as follows:</span></p><p><strong>The Seemings:</strong> The inborn classification of the Lost, representing the scars of each Changeling's time in Faerie and the manner of their keeping. Each Seeming is associated with a number of Kiths or subgroupings.</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Beasts:</strong> Those who were transformed into animals by their keepers. This Seeming includes those who are associated with real-life animals such as hounds, lions, and eagles, as well as those associated with fictional or mythical animals such as griffins, mermaids and sphinxes. Beasts gain supernatural composure and animal magnetism from their Seeming, but lose some of their mental ability as they have had trouble regaining their human faculties.<ul><li> Beast Kiths vary from outright embodiment of specific animals to embodying animals as they are associated with certain traits and qualities. From the corebook; <em>Broadbacks</em> (those of great endurance... and stubbornness), <em>Hunterhearts</em> (predators and other creatures with built-in weaponry), <em>Runnerswifts</em> (creatures of remarkable speed), <em>Skitterskulks</em> (creepy-crawlies or other creatures with jittering reflexes), <em>Steepscramblers</em> (climbing animals), <em>Swimmerskins</em> (aquatic and water-loving creatures), <em>Venombites</em> (poisonous animals) and <em>Windwings</em> (flying animals). To these, "Winter Masques" added the <em>Cleareyes</em> (representing creatures renowned for their senses), <em>Coldscales</em> (reptiles), <em>Roteaters</em> (carrion-eating beasts) and <em>Truefriends</em> (representing pets, pack animals, or others emphasizing loyalty to others). They also got one extra kith in "Grim Fears"; the <em>Riddleseekers</em> kith embodies animals as representatives of wisdom and cunning (sphinxes, spiders, snakes, owls, etc).</li><li> Culture-based Beast Kiths (Also from Winter Masques) include: <em>Chimeras</em> (mix-and-match creatures who get along with hobgoblins), <em>Coyotes</em> (clever and greedy beasts), and <em>Nixes</em> (watery beings with intoxicating voices).</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Darklings:</strong> Often taken for breaking some obscure or arcane law of the Fae, Darklings were taken to lands of nightmare to become nightmares themselves. Boogeymen, face-changers, gargoyles, succubi, and scholars of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">lore mankind ought not know</a> make up the ranks of this Seeming. Darklings are witty and adept at lying and hiding, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">but find their magic less effective during daylight hours, due to their bond to the darkness.</a><ul><li> Corebook Darkling Kiths are the <em>Antiquarians</em> (keepers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">ancient lore and forgotten knowledge</a>), <em>Gravewights</em> (those with ties to death and the undead), <em>Leechfingers</em> (soul-suckers, breath-stealers and blood-drinkers), <em>Mirrorskins</em> (shapeshifters and face-changers) and <em>Tunnelgrubs</em> (things that crawl and squirm below the ground). "Winter Masques" added <em>Lurkgliders</em> (gargoyles and flying... things), <em>Moonborn</em> (children of the moon and madness), <em>Nightsingers</em> (players of "the music of the night"), <em>Palewraiths</em> (spectres, shadows, and the like), <em>Razorhands</em> (serial killer-style nightmares) and <em>Whisperwisps</em> (spies and rumor-whisperers). "Victorian Lost" offers up the <em>Lurkers</em> (master thieves and pickpockets).</li><li> Culture-based Darkling Kiths (Also from Winter Masques) include: <em>Illes</em> (Icelandic trolls with illusory beauty), <em>Pishacha</em> (Hindu cloud spirits that induce madness), and <em>Skogsra</em> (animal-controlling forest-dwellers).</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Elementals:</strong> Humans taken and transformed into inanimate 'things' - statues, snowdrifts, pools, streams, puffs of air, dolls, and other, more obscure items and substances. Connected as they are to the "bones of the earth," to the most primal, basic, and often durable of substances, Elementals have the ability to endure stunning amounts of punishment and damage, but they have trouble dealing with and understanding humans. How do you identify with standard-issue mortals when you've spent time as a tree, or a bonfire, or the sky itself?<ul><li> The Seeming whose kiths are most straightforward; the corebook Elementals are <em>Airtouched</em> (air), <em>Earthbones</em> (earth and stone), <em>Fireheart</em> (fire), <em>Manikin</em> (man-made items), <em>Snowskin</em> (cold), <em>Waterborn</em> (water) and <em>Woodblood</em> (plants). "Winter Masques" introduced the <em>Blightbent</em> (pollution), <em>Levinquick</em> (electricity), <em>Metalflesh</em> (metal) and <em>Sandharrowed</em> (sand) kiths.</li><li> Culture-based Elemental Kiths (also from Winter Masques) include: <em>Apsaras</em> (watery tarts who induce lust), <em>Ask-wee-da-eed</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp">will-o'-the-wisps</a> who bring bad luck), and <em>Di-cang</em> (jeweled Bodhisattvas who ease pain and... uh, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">break into things</a>).</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Fairest:</strong> Of Them All. Mortals taken by the Fae and sculpted into images of beauty (or, at least, of intriguing attractiveness), then kept in torturous ecstasy by their keepers. The Fairest were often used as pleasure slaves or concubines by the Fae. Others were singers and dancers, or cast as statues to be viewed and enjoyed by the Gentry. A rare few (especially of the Draconic kith) were warrior-artists or magical monsters like dragons and chimeras. Due to their preternatural beauty and grace, Fairest wield advanced presence, persuasive skill, and social poise, but their separation from humanity (and, in some ways, from other Lost) tends to hasten their descent into madness.<ul><li> Fairest have the greatest variety of kiths. <em>Bright Ones</em> embody light. <em>Dancers</em> used their grace and agility to amuse their Keeper. <em>Draconics</em> embody the glory of the Great Beasts; dragons, chimerae, manticores and the like. <em>Flowering</em> Fairest were used as literal pieces of horticultural art or scent to use their seductive musks upon others. <em>Muses</em> were used to inspire, be it admiration, disgust or fear. Of their "Winter Masques" kiths: <em>Flamesirens</em> represent the entrancing beauty of fire. <em>Polychromatics</em> are living embodiments of the shifting rainbow. <em>Shadowsouls</em> show how darkness can be beautiful as light. <em>Telluric</em> Fairest are bonded to the stars and the celestial bodies. <em>Treasured</em> were living trophies to be admired and coveted by their Keeper. "Grim Fears" adds another set: <em>Minstrels</em> amused their Keeper with music and/or song. <em>Romancers</em> were the idealized lovers of the True Fae, and punished terribly for being anything less than perfect. <em>Larcenists</em> stole for their Keepers, and often stole their freedom from their Keepers. Perhaps worst of all, the <em>Playmates</em> were taken to be the "best friend" of a childish True Fae.</li><li> Culture-based Fairest Kiths (also from Winter Masques) include: <em>Gandharva</em> (eloquent androgynes), <em>Succubus (or Incubus)</em> (beautiful seducers), and <em>Weisse Frau</em> (gentle protectors).</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Ogres:</strong> Victims of monstrous brutality, Ogres had to become brutal monsters to survive. Often, but not always, big and imposing, Ogres can be cunning cyclopes, massive giants, nimble and bloodthirsty redcaps, or surly trolls. Their strength and fighting skill have been boosted by their Durances, and they can be terrifying when they wish, but the workings of the Others can leave them gullible and sometimes dull-witted, often with short tempers.<ul><li> <em>Cyclopeans</em> are Ogres with preternaturally accurate senses, though the ogres are often maimed or handicapped in some way. <em>Farwalkers</em> are bestial Ogres of the wilderness. <em>Gargantuans</em> are giants even among Ogres. <em>Gristlegrinders</em> are gifted and cursed with gnashing maws (and often a matching hunger for flesh). <em>Stonebones</em> display the toughness of a mountain cliffside. <em>Water-Dwellers</em> are amphibious Ogres. Of new Kiths introduced in "Winter Masques": <em>Bloodbrutes</em> are survivors of Arcadian gladiatorial arenas and wrestling rings. <em>Corpsegrinders</em> were fed on death. <em>Renders</em> can destroy almost anything they touch, a legacy of their time as laborers with no tools save their hands, or as living siege weapons. <em>Witchteeth</em> are Ogres who have proven more receptive to the mystical side of their Faerie nature, embodying the cruel man-eating witch and the magic-wielding giant of old lore.</li><li> Culture-based Ogre Kiths (from Winter Masques) include: <em>Daitya</em> (giants who rend and tear with supernatural ease), <em>Oni</em> (demons who gain power from the blood of the sinful), and <em>Trolls</em> (manipulative brutes).</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Wizened:</strong> The Wizened endured endless tortures, then lives of undignified, often pointless drudgery, at the hands of their Keepers. They cleaned the houses, dens, or lairs of their Fae captors, crafted tools and machines, healed (or helped to alter) other Changeling captives, and sometimes served as butlers or cooks in the Fae households. Each Wizened has been 'reduced' in some way - height, weight, size, or sheer physical presence has been shrunk. Some are dwarfish, others unnaturally thin, and still others seem less 'real' than other people. Wizened are clever and nimble, often able to dodge attacks with unbelievable skill, but most are spiteful, shy, or otherwise have trouble dealing with people.<ul><li> The Wizened kiths all relate to the tasks they performed. <em>Artists</em> (obsessive craftsmen), <em>Brewers</em> (creators of heady and potent potables), <em>Chatelaines</em> (impeccably-mannered valets and diplomats), <em>Chirurgeons</em> (unrivaled doctors and surgeons), <em>Oracles</em> (fortunetellers), <em>Smiths</em> (forgers of magical tools), <em>Soldiers</em> (battle-scarred swordsmen), and <em>Woodwalkers</em> (survivors of alien wildernesses), "Winter Masques" adds: <em>Authors</em> (master polyglots), <em>Drudges</em> (swift but overlooked workers), <em>Gameplayers</em> (clever masters of trivial pursuits), and <em>Miners</em> (telegraphing without the telegraph). "Victorian Lost" adds <em>Inventors</em> (makers of technological wonders). "Swords at Dawn" adds <em>Fatemakers</em> (those skilled in Talecrafting better than others).</li><li> Culture-based Wizened Kiths (from Winter Masques) include: <em>Gremlins</em> (tinkerers who render equipment useless), <em>Pamarindo</em> (greasy but sustaining epicures), and <em>Thussers</em> (mesmerizing musicians).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Second Edition modifies the Seeming/Kith setup: your Seeming is based on what happened in Arcadia, how you escaped or how you approach the world now, whereas your Kith is a specialization your Keeper imposed upon you or something you gained through the Hedge. Any Kith can belong to any Seeming, and will manifest in an appropriate fashion. A seventh Seeming was introduced in <em>World of Darkness: Dark Eras</em> during the development period, before the book was completely developed.</p><p><strong>The Courts:</strong> Half political party, a third support group, 5/7ths ruling body, and .75 masonic lodge, the Courts are the chosen Splats of Changeling. The various court systems offer protection from the Others by confusing Them with the sharing of power - or, at least, this is the theory.</p><p><strong>The Seasonal Courts</strong> - The most commonly-followed Court system in Europe and the Americas, this court system changes power with the seasons, the Spring Court handing over rule of the Freehold to the Summer Court on the Solstice. These courts tend to have "splinter" courts, in those areas with slightly different takes on the seasons &mdash; an equatorial country may have Dry Season and Wet Season courts as the only courts, both splitting off from Summer.</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Spring Court</em> - After being twisted and stunted by the Gentry for so long, Changelings should have the ability to grow again. The Antler Crown is all about growth, healing, and rejuvenation. They dive into life, often developing a strong presence in the mortal world. Their court emotion is Desire. Variants include Short Spring<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0b8dy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0b8dy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0b8dy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Like the land itself, the Changelings grow swift and verdant, but tend to be fickle and indecisive. The Growing Season Court is about the time of greenery outpouring, fast rains, animals breeding. Their court emotion is Desire's shade: Lust.</span> and Whirlwind Spring<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10wzx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10wzx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10wzx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> These Changelings allow their desires to run rampant, dark and mad urges and whims dragging them unpredictably here and there. This utter lack of control makes them mavericks, and they are often outside the court system proper.</span>.</li><li> <em>Summer Court</em> - If the Gentry return, we'll be ready. The Iron Spear is focused on martial prowess and strength (or skill) in general, and often stands as the freehold's army. The ranks of Summer also include generals, scouts, and the occasional diplomat or lawyer. Their court emotion is Wrath. Variants include the Dry Season<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25i87');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25i87" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25i87');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Summer is a time of brittleness, dryness, bitterness, cracking. These Changelings explode into frenzies of hate and wrath at unpredictable intervals that can scour those who oppose them like a roaring conflagration. Their court emotion is Rage.</span> and the Monsoon Season.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jew2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3jew2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jew2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Revenge is not a dish to serve cold, but piping hot, fresh and <em>bloody</em>. These Changelings clamor and howl vindication of broken hearts and betrayed pledges &mdash; their wrath is personal to them. <em>Always</em>. Their court emotion is Sanguine.</span></li><li> <em>Autumn Court</em> - The best way to beat the Gentry is to understand how they work. The Leaden Mirror consists of occultists, Hedge wanderers, and sorcerers. They learn and develop powerful Contracts, catalogue the weaknesses of the True Fae, and even study the other strange denizens of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>. Their court emotion is Fear.</li><li> <em>Winter Court</em> - We drew the attention of the Gentry once, and we sure as hell won't do it again. The Silent Arrow deals in stealth, secrets, and obfuscation, with the main goal of keeping the Lost safe by keeping them secret. Members serve as spies or scouts and often create safe houses for others of their Court or Freehold. Their court emotion is Sorrow. One variant is the Dead Season<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4eksb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4eksb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4eksb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> in the depths of the Long Winter, sorrow and grief lose all of their passion, becoming so deep and all-consuming that one can barely muster any emotion at all. The court emotion of these tundra-like Changelings is Despair.</span>.</li></ul><p><strong>The Directional Courts</strong> - Wide portions of Asia, including Japan, China, and surrounding countries, follow this system, which divides the Freehold into quarters, each ruled by an Emperor.</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>North Court</em> - The best way to resist the depredations of the Gentry is to guard one's self against the burdens of the world. The Court of the Tortoise consists of ascetics and disciplined scholars who expose themselves to pain and exposure, believing that the Others won't take them again if the courtiers have nothing to lose. Their court emotion is Suffering.</li><li> <em>East Court</em> - The best way to shore one's self against the Gentry is to build power and influence. Businessmen and manipulators, the Court of the Serpent uses wealth and notoriety to maintain their kingdoms. Courtiers often develop sprawling webs of influence and status. Their court emotion is Envy.</li><li> <em>South Court</em> - The Gentry opened our mind to new senses, and the best way to adapt is to lose yourself in them. Artists and Ecstatics, the Court of the Phoenix throws itself into its interests with passions unmatched by others. They believe that the strength of their emotion grants them power with which to defend against the Others. Their court emotion is Ecstasy.</li><li> <em>West Court</em> - We will stand against the Gentry and protect the others of the freehold at all costs. Warriors and generals, the Court of the Tiger stands firm against all threats. Unlike the less controlled Summer court, the West Court tends toward rigid, almost obsessive discipline. Their court emotion is Honor.</li></ul><p><strong>The Diurnal Courts</strong> - Followed in areas of Eastern Europe, this system changes power at twilight and focuses on balance and equal opposition, each court seeking to overcome and undo the works of the other.</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Sun Court</em> - One must stand against the sins of the world and serve as a beacon to others. The Court of the Day is dedicated to serving as paladins, priests, and moral figures to the rest of the freehold. Much as the Others cannot understand the sharing of power, they say, They cannot understand true virtue, and so living virtuously offers a defense. Their court emotion is Shame.</li><li> <em>Moon Court</em> - The world is a sinful place, and sin can give you strength. The Court of the Night consists of malcontents, criminals and radicals who deal in vice and laugh in the face of unyielding righteousness. After having been controlled by their Keepers, Moon Courtiers refuse to allow society to dictate their actions. Their court emotion is Disgust.</li></ul><p><strong>Other Courts</strong> - Some freeholds follow court systems even more obscure than those listed above. The Dawn and Dusk courts, for example, change power depending on the whims of fate and the welfare of the Freehold itself.</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Dawn Court</em> - There's always the chance things will change, if you're willing to sacrifice, and things can always get better. The Court of the Dawn is made up of visionaries, martyrs, and others who believe that with hard work and change, things can improve. Their court emotion is Hope.</li><li> <em>Dusk Court</em> - Everything's going to Hell in a hand-basket - the Freehold, the world, everything. 'Course, that just means you've got to work, fight, and party like it's your last day alive, 'cuz, heck, it probably is. Dusk Courtiers are warriors, seers, and others with the strength to accept that a dark fate was coming but face it nonetheless. Their court emotion is Fatalism.</li></ul><p>The 2nd Edition corebook features several sets of alternate Court systems. One calls itself a single Court with three "Societies" (Morning, Day, and Night), while the others are the four Tidal Courts (High, Ebb, Low, and Flood) and the four Traders' Courts (Coins, Barter, Favors, and Shady Deals).</p><p><strong>Terminology, with translations:</strong> Every <em>Changeling</em> (Character) was once a perfectly normal (or at most mildly exceptional) human taken by one of the True Fae, enduring a <em>Durance</em> (length of time) in Arcadia, and frequently replaced by a <em>Fetch</em> (almost-twin) created by their True Fae abductor to fill their place in the real world. Surviving in Arcadia shapes the abducted into a member of one of six <em>Seemings,</em> (class) probably with an associated <em>Kith</em> (sub-class). Once they have returned, most Changelings choose to join a <em>Court</em> (faction) of like-minded Changelings, which gives the Changeling extra power and an infrastructure to draw upon. Changelings enact powers known as <em>Contracts</em> (spells), which represent clauses in ancient deals brokered between the Fae and aspects of reality itself. A city full of Changelings is known as a <em>Freehold</em> generally made up of one or more <em>Motleys</em> (parties), small groups of allied Changelings. Some Changelings further join an <em>Entitlement</em> (prestige class) for more power, allies, or what have you.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This game features examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">Alien Abduction</a>: Some of the True Fae are said to be the source of modern-day abduction myths, bearing the grey skin, bulbous heads, and almond-shaped eyes of the mythical extraterrestrial Greys. In a way, those who believe folks are being abducted by aliens are <em>right,</em> except that rather than being extraterrestrial, they're extradimensional. And magic. And to confuse the issue, it's <em>also</em> stated that the True Fae are idea thieves, meaning that they didn't come up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a> image themselves (hell, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a> version that has them as mortal cryptids, completely unrelated to Fae)... and that some disappearances have nothing to do with the Gentry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienFairFolk">Alien Fair Folk</a>: As mentioned above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a> are implied to be one of the forms of the True Fey. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Probably.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>: Somewhat exists in the game.

From Hindu lore comes the <em>Gandharva</em> (Fairest), <em>Daitya</em> (Ogre), <em>Apsaras</em> (Elemental) and the <em>Pishacha</em> (Darkling). American Indian stories give rise to the <em>Coyote</em> and <em>Ask-wee-da-eed</em> kiths of Beasts and Elementals. The <em>Weisse Frau</em> (Fairest) and <em>Nix</em> (Beast) are both Germanic in origin. Italy gives the Wizened the <em>Pamarindo</em> kith. Scandinavian (specifically Norwegian and Icelandic) and Swiss stories of <em>Trolls</em> (Ogre), <em>Thussers</em> (Wizened), <em>Illes</em> (Darkling), and <em>Skogsra</em> (Darkling) take a life of their own beyond the Hedge. The <em>Di-cang</em> is an Elemental kith based on Buddhist lore, while the <em>Oni</em> is a Japanese version of the Ogre. Even more modern cultures aren't immune, with Wizened who bear the kith of the <em>Gremlin</em>... and there's classics like Beasts of the <em>Chimera</em> kith and Fairest who represent the <em>Succubus and Incubus</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles">All Therapists Are Muggles</a>: Invoked, played straight, and defied. Having a psychotherapist who isn't a Changeling (or at least Ensorcelled) does give a penalty to therapy rolls, but there's an entire Prestige Class based around the idea of changelings becoming therapists to help out their own kind.<ul><li> It's also noted in the core book that many Changelings find attending group therapy for abuse survivors to be helpful, if only in a limited fashion. The experiences aren't <em>exactly</em> the same, and while the Changeling can't talk openly about their experiences, knowing that there are completely normal people who've suffered at the hands of other completely normal people is still somewhat cathartic.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a>: All Courts, seemings, and entitlements have a official character traits and several official alternative character traits in universe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: The True Fae. Well, it's more like Always Chaotic Neutral, but the distinction is academic given their behavior. As <em>Autumn Nightmares</em> says, the True Fae are "fiends" with a totally narcissistic and solipsistic worldview. Any True Fae that acts "good" or "in love" is doing just that: acting, in an ultimately doomed attempt to understand the human condition that they will almost certainly get bored of one day. Any True Fae that does something helpful for a person does so either because it's within their own interests or on a whim, not out of any true altruism. Not even the "Charlatans" (True Fae who have gotten stuck in the mortal world and forgotten they are not human) are an exception to this rule, as they're still just Fae even if they don't know it and therefore just as soulless as any other True Fae... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">though ones that can develop some small degree of genuine empathy</a> and a Clarity gauge (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">in all books not Autumn Nightmares</a>, that is).

All Knights de Cuisine smell like food, but what <em>sort</em> of food they smell like depends on both an observer's attitude towards the changeling and their own association of food with pleasant/indifferent/nasty. For example, if two people like the same Knight, she may smell like apple pie to one and buttercream icing to the other. Likewise, if they hate her, she may smell like boiling cabbage to one and Brussels sprouts to the other.

Clarity is based on things that will cause changes in perception as well as "sins." The main difference, historically, between Changelings and the True Fae are that the Changelings try to keep a grip on conventional morality and help people when possible. True Fae help people whenever they want to, and even then, they often can't bring themselves to really care.

Under their Mask, though, a changeling is still recognizably inhuman. Imagine being, for example, a Blightbent, and having skin that constantly seeps oil, or toxic chemicals, or who exhales clouds of chemical smog, or whose body is covered in glowing, pus-seeping tumors. Or a Manikin who has had the flesh flayed from their ribcage, which now unhinges to reveal the clicking clockwork organs that fill their innards.<ul><li> Some Entitlements can actually warp a changeling even further.

Technically, Loyalists work directly for one of the True Fae (whether out of misguided loyalty or just in order to avoid a horrible fate for themselves).

A character might be able to talk to dogs, remain comfortable in any temperature, enhance her performance skills, seem to be a celebrity, and interrogate the landscape of a parallel dimension. When you bring in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">goblin contracts</a>, the platter can get really overloaded.<ul><li> Point in fact, the mechanics of the game <em>itself</em> tend to encourage this, as Changelings pay less to purchase/upgrade their "affinity" power sets than any other denizen in the World of Darkness, and have far, <em>far</em> more of them as well &mdash; a vampire has affinity to three Disciplines (four if of a Bloodline), but a Changeling has Affinity to nearly every type of Contract except the specialty Contracts of other Courts and Seemings.<ul><li> Considering how outright weird most contracts are, you kind of need a lot of them to have even a shot at having one useful for a current situation.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Compelling Voice</a>: There are Kiths, Merits, and Contracts all out there to represent this archetypal Fae power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel">Cooking Duel</a>: Duels among the Lost aren't always decided via combat. <em>Swords at Dawn</em> details the various types of duels the Courts use to resolve disputes, split along lines of Physical, Mental, Social, and Mystical. Sure, two members of the martial Summer Court could engage in a fist-fight to first blood... but they could also easily decide on a duel where each argues a case before an impartial judge and tries to make the best argument.

Truth is, it's heavily implied that most Keepers don't even notice their slaves are missing, much less care, and part of the point of the game is that while horrible things were done to you, you gained something more than what you lost, even if what you lost was something you dearly valued. This is one of the two games (the other being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a>) where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a> is explicitly an option.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>: It doesn't get much more corrupt than Baron Fairweather, a True Fae <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">personifying capitalist greed.</a></em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">Creative Sterility</a>: The True Fae are incapable of bearing children, creating art, or even feeling like humans feel. Changelings are better off, but still suffer from very low (almost nil) biological fertility. There is also some flavor regarding making items through magic, or using luck magic to succeed at a creative task, which always seems less good than work done mundanely.<ul><li> Some True Fae do spawn "children", either on their own or impregnated into human women, but these are hobgoblin creations rather than more True Fae. An already-pregnant human woman who sleeps with one of the True Fae has her unborn child affected by it; they will have the Unseen Sense Merit and often mental problems as well.</li><li> Fetches, by default, can't have children because they're nothing but pale imitations of human life. <em>Autumn Nightmares</em> offers the possibility that they can have a child if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove">truly love the human they're courting</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">don't know that their pretense of humanity is a lie</a>.

Certain goblin-beasts in the Hedge reflections of the tundra bear a goblin fruit called "pedicle velvet", which causes the eater's next heterosexual encounter to produce a pregnancy. It explicitly doesn't safeguard the embryo from miscarriage or abortion, but it's still a conception. A more difficult and dangerous option is granted by the final Clause of the Contracts of Shade &amp; Spirit, a charm called "Opening the Black Gate", which opens a doorway to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Underworld</a>. The Underworld has a river called Eresh-ki-gala, the River of Dead Seed &mdash; "drinking" from this river will cause the drinker to be able to produce a pregnancy through their next heterosexual act, even if his partner (or her partner) is infertile. A soup made from the comb of Fenghuang, a phoenix-like hobgoblin with the power to bring the recently killed back to life, will grant the drinker fertility akin to the other options, so much so that ordinary contraception will fail to prevent the drinker from producing a pregnancy. Finally, the Goblin Contract "Goblin Midwife" once more offers the guarantee that the target's next heterosexual act will generate a baby - but the child will have some fae flaw, and the changeling who enacts the Contract will lose the affection of someone he loves. Nothing comes free, though a child conceived by any means other than the Goblin Midwife contract will be a normally person, or at most Fae-touched. Arcadian characteristics are not inherited.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>: Fetch-children.

Depending on the Storyteller, Fetch-children fall into two categories: strange, fae children, created from nothingness and a wisp of a soul, anathema to both mortals and Fae, or truly alien creatures who have no connection to the Wyrd, no compulsion against killing to get what they want, and no understanding that other beings exist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuriosityCausesConversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuriosityCausesConversion">Curiosity Causes Conversion</a>: This is a central mechanic for the True Fae. As primordial chaotic beings, they can't understand human things like altruism or love; they just view them as passing fancies to be tossed aside when convenient rather than defining forces. In trying to understand these bedrocks of humanity, they <em>become</em> human, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">cutting themselves off from their fae memories and a good chunk of the powers.</a> Of course, in most cases, that only lasts as long as they don't start getting curious about fae existence...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Curse</a>: As is only proper in a faerie tale.

You're a dead Changeling if you aren't ready to run as soon as the Contract is invoked. Most Goblin Contracts have drawbacks (one that unlocks any door for you has the drawback that the next person to break into your home gets the same benefit, and sends out a subtle beacon to that kind of person just to make sure it happens).

They're totally unable to relate to other human beings on an emotional or social level. They tend to kill things... just because. This is all exacerbated by the fact that their touch automatically opens all doors and springs all locks, they cannot be bound or imprisoned, and people tend to ignore them, so they're able to slip around without notice. They are immune to Changeling powers, and their touch drains the Lost of magical energies. Oh... and did we mention that at the age of 21 they get sucked back into the Hedge, likely to become Gentry themselves?<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">On the other hand</a>, the other kind of fetch-child, supposedly created when a Fetch who still thinks he's human has biblical study of a person he truly loves is almost always psychologically healthy.

Because the realm runs on Contracts, if you aren't part of them, the very elements of nature have no reason to behave rationally towards you. Water won't slake your thirst and fire won't warm your body, but you can still drown or burn. The only way to survive is to either get back out before you die of exposure or other unpleasantness (far harder than it sounds), or get included in the Contracts that make the realm function... which is done by entering service to a True Fae.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a>: The True Fae are, by their very nature, utterly sociopathic, incapable of seeing other people as anything other than toys or pets, at best. Their inability to understand humans is vital to the True Fae's power. If one <em>does</em> grow to understand humanity, its power is drastically reduced, and it may very well lose its memories and find itself permanently exiled to the Mortal world. Changelings base their government on sharing power to take advantage of this, because the idea of voluntarily choosing <em>not</em> to possess all the power throws the True Fae off. (Unfortunately for Miami, however, the local Summer King decided to throw that particular idea out the window. Oops.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>: Nearly all Changelings are replaced by a Fetch, a construct made from whatever's lying around, along with a piece of the original's shadow, when taken. This fetch looks and acts exactly (or nearly exactly) like the original, and in many cases believes it <em>is</em> the original until a creature with its face and wood for skin shows up. Some Fetches still serve the True Fae, or are simply emotionless monsters.

Some freeholds make it a point of law to kill fetches, perhaps even using it as an initiation rite &mdash; some changelings will even hunt down and slay any fetch they can find, not just their own, though even in fetch-killer thresholds this is looked down on. Because it robs the fetch's changeling of the chance to kill the fetch of their own accord, and thusly denies them an important part in returning to the human world, not because of any sympathies with the fetch. As mentally shattering as it can be to kill a fetch, it's still an important milestone and can bestow a number of supernatural benefits.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>: There's generally no such thing as "the spirit of the agreement" when it comes to pledges, especially not when the True Fae are involved.

Firstly are the True Fae, which are creatures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Lovecraftian power and alienness</a> who abduct humans for their own reasons. Secondly are Hobgoblins, fae creatures from the in-between realm of the Hedge that range from plantlike to superhuman. Finally, the player characters themselves have been transformed into fae creatures by their time among the True Fae. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that lots of fairy tales about antagonistic faeries were based on the True Fae; tales of benevolent faeries generally recounted the actions of Changelings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a>: Fetches live out the lives of the people they've replaced, oblivious to the fact that their whole life is a sham... until the taken human, now a Changeling, escapes from Faerie. Most Fetches aren't aware anything's amiss until this happens, and most take the news that they are fakes with memories stolen from a small piece of a person's soul poorly. Of course, sometimes the Fetch's memories are imperfect to begin with...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Familiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Familiar">Familiar</a>: Changelings (and other fae creatures) sometimes take Hedge Beasts as pet/sidekick/companions. These are Hobgoblins who look exactly like a mortal animal, except that they can speak and have human-level intelligence.<ul><li> They can also use Changeling Merits and Contracts. So its entirely possible to have an Ogre based around smashing things to have a Hedgebeast Buddy that's really good at research and packing Wizened contracts.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a>: Goblin Fruits in general have the potential to be like this; the corebook even contains a plot hook for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em> crossover in which a goblin fruit called "bloodroot" is being sold on to the local kindred. Bloodroot is harmless to changelings, but to vampires, it's a powerful narcotic &mdash; and one they can actually feel wholeheartedly and without needing to use through human blood to enjoy.<ul><li> In addition, <em>Rites of Spring</em> lists rules for Glamour intoxication, letting Changelings who indulge too strongly get drunk on the essential power of human emotion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFragility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFragility">Fantastic Fragility</a>: Every contract has a catch, and every oath wriggle room. Breaking them is no less catastrophic, though.<ul><li> Notably, the True Fae are terrifyingly powerful, but suffer from varying weaknesses that clever changelings can mercilessly exploit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a> being the foremost.</li><li> When a Changeling's Wyrd raises to 6, they start taking Frailties which could range from having to count spilled grains of rice to pain from the sound of church bells. In 2nd Edition, they instead start getting these Frailties at a mere Wyrd <em>2</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFruitsAndVegetables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFruitsAndVegetables">Fantastic Fruits and Vegetables</a>: Goblin Fruits and oddments.

Several high-power spells and special effects put out a beacon for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">True Fae</a>. Using these in a fight is considered worse than killing the target- worse even than breaking a Pledge with your best friends.

The Changelings, human slaves abducted to act as servants, have to enter pacts with every element in order to even survive. The world changes according to what a Faerie thinks is entertaining. The True Fae are powerful outside their home realms, but have nowhere near this level of control over other domains.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKingdom">Fisher Kingdom</a>: If the True Fae and their Contracts don't directly alter captives themselves, there's also the fact that they're living in a Faerie domain, eating Faerie food, drinking Faerie water, and doing Faerie work.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackNightmare">Flashback Nightmare</a>: Changelings often dream incomplete memories of their Durance... dreams which become clearer and more accurate the more powerful the Changeling gets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingDutchman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingDutchman">Flying Dutchman</a>: Jack o' the Lantern, of Grim Fears.

Also, some of the fluff indicates that humans transform into Changelings in Arcadia, in part, by eating the food, drinking the water, and breathing the air.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a>: the Directional Courts of China are patterned off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a> and supposedly embody associated values (the North Court is made up of ascetics who use suffering to escape memory of their durance at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, the East Court values material wealth and draws power from envy, the South Court consists of artists and other creatives who value ecstasy, and the West Court is made up of honor-bound warriors).<ul><li> Every area in which the Directional Courts take hold are subject to an unpleasant extra facet - a "Demon's Gate", usually a particularly nasty Trod, somewhere in its northeast. Closing or destroying one just means another one opens elsewhere.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a>: Many Wizened, especially those with high levels in the contracts of Artifice, Animation, or both.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster">Gargle Blaster</a>: Wizened Brewers get the ability to turn any beverage, whether initially alcoholic or not, into this with the expenditure of a point of Glamour.

Some people, and all fae, can see through this Mask, however. In addition, the more powerful a Changeling is, the more likely it is that some of his true nature will bleed through - a bristling beard turns rootlike, an underbite looks like tusks out of the corner of the eye, that sort of thing. Some mortals also have a chance of seeing through the Mask, specifically children, madmen, those under the influence of drugs, and others with "altered" states of mind. Whenever the Changeling is in the Hedge, an otherworld between our world and Arcadia, his true shape is visible to any who are looking. A Changeling can "turn off" his Mask by burning any Glamour remaining in his system for the effect, revealing his true Mein to the world. Finally, Changelings can intentionally allow others to see beyond the Mask by Ensorcelling them, imbuing them with Glamour (usually through a Pledge) so that they can see through the Mask. A Changeling can also use Glamour to strengthen the mask for a few moments against those that are trying to see past it, but even then his shadow will reflect his true face and not the Mask he wears.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassWeapon">Glass Weapon</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptureAndReplicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptureAndReplicate">Fetches</a> can learn to pull a glass blade out of any pane of glass they can touch, with mirrors giving the best result.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: Or so say the members of the entitlement known as The Lost Pantheon. And considering the fact that they get more perceptive and long-lived the more delusional they get, they can derive Glamour from being worshiped, and they get bonuses versus the True Fae and their servants, well, they <em>may</em> have a point.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>: The Aurochs Horn and Call the Wild Hunt summon the True Fae. It takes absolute desperation to see this as a good idea, although it is JUST possible enough to use this as a trick to kill the Fae summoned. But you'd also have to be very desperate (or vengeful) to want to attempt that either.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">Go Mad from the Isolation</a>: A Changeling who spends too long without human contact must roll to check for Clarity loss - by avoiding others, he finds himself stewing in his own twisted perceptions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>: The expected result any time a Changeling uses Call the Wild Hunt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification">Grimmification</a>: The Home Game!!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks">Growing Up Sucks</a>: Arguably inverted as opposed to the old Changeling; which the focus is no longer on keeping your innocence and naivete in a harsh and dark world but rather about finding the way back from the loss of innocence and the pains of life and learning how to put yourself back together and discover what comes next.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauteCuisineIsWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauteCuisineIsWeird">Haute Cuisine Is Weird</a>: Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the Knights of the Knowledge of the Tongue, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Entitlement</a> for whom perfect food is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">everything</a></em>.

Bridge-Burners try to close down all doors between the real world and the Hedge, despite the utility (verging on necessity) other Changelings find in it. Militia members seek to "enlist" other members into probably-Pyrrhic battles against the Others. Even members of the standard Courts who don't fall in with one of the extremist groups can become oppressors themselves in order to develop power with which to fight or avoid the Others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedgeOfThorns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedgeOfThorns">The Hedge of Thorns</a>: The... er... Hedge. There are Thorns in it. Yeah.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellGate">Hell Gate</a>: From the eyes of most folks a Hedge Gate would definitely apply. Not only is the Hedge a dangerous, soul-tearing place, but Arcadia, on the far side, is much, much worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">Hobbits</a>: Probably the closest analogues in this game would be the Wizened Drudges.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a>: Disturbingly common. Not only are there Gristlegrinder Ogres and some Hunterheart Beasts whose teeth and mouths have become deadly weapons and who often spent their Durances chowing down on whatever or whoever they could catch, but some Kiths, such as the Darkling Leechfinger or Ogre Oni, can heal themselves by eating their foes. Any of these could face cannibalistic urges. And this isn't counting those driven to cannibalism through the workings of their steadily-worsening psychosis.<ul><li> The Ogre stereotype on Mortals says it all &mdash; <em>You're beautiful.

Elementals of fire, Darklings and certain Fairest might echo the modern conception of the demon or devil - either frightening, alluring, or both. Wizened and ogres might appear similar to horned goblins or trolls. Beasts might be transformed into bulls or rams.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">Horny Devils</a>: A potent enough archetype to have its own kith in <em>Winter Masques</em>; the Fairest's Succubus kith (called "Incubus" for male changelings with it). The changeling gets a bonus to Social rolls against people with the same Vice as the Incubus (with the bonus increased if the shared vice is Lust) and all of them are blessed with at least a modicum of Striking Looks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">Humanity Ensues</a>: Those who were taken and turned into Beasts and Elementals have a hard time adjusting back to being human again. The Beasts have a hard time thinking non-instinctively after being animals for so long, and the Elementals have trouble relating to other people after spending so long as flames or trees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious">Humanity Is Infectious</a>: In their original state, True Fae are incapable of caring about other beings, or even understanding <em>how</em> to care for other beings. If the Kindly One actually manages to understand and feel strongly about humanity, in any way, he loses all memory of his true nature and the vast majority of his power, becoming a Charlatan, a Banished Fae.<ul><li> Emphasis on "in any way", with one example noting how a True Fae became banished by understanding a <em>serial killer</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>: The True Fae can Mask themselves as humans when in the real world, although there's always some sign of what they really are.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a>: Subverted outright (Dancers In Dusk states few things rekindle a changeling's much-needed faith in other people then visiting a stranger's dreams for the first time).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness">Hyper-Awareness</a>: At the highest levels of Clarity, a Changeling is so adept at telling what's real from what's not that it grants a form of this. Not only do high-Clarity Changelings gain bonuses to mundane perception, but they gain access to the Kenning, allowing them to sense supernatural critters, even when hidden.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">Hyperspace Is a Scary Place</a>: Due to quirks of time and distance, it's possible to walk from place to place in the Hedge much quicker than it would be to walk in the real world.

Even if the promise wasn't sworn as a magical Pledge, it's generally considered bad luck to renege on an oath, as the Wyrd may be watching anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">I Have Many Names</a>: The True Fae are called many things by their once-slaves out of fear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil">they might come if called</a>: the Keepers, the Gentry, the Others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatYouFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatYouFear">I Know What You Fear</a>: The first Clause of the Contracts of Fleeting Autumn grants this ability.

Both Changelings and Keepers have True Names, with the power gained over the individual in question varying depending on which rulesets are used.

The "rumors" side bars on various Entitlements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">often make some pretty large leaps of logic</a>, and sometimes conflict with the actual write-up; ie, just plain wrong.

It often <em>does</em>, but it's made quite clear in <em>Rites of Spring</em> that this is a result of the individual changeling's madness, not a loss in Clarity directly. It recommends that changelings who are losing their grip on it be treated with sympathy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsertPaymentToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsertPaymentToUse"> Insert Payment to Use</a>: The Catch means that not only can Tokens work this way, but so can the Changelings' Contracts. Catches range from a putting handful of dead fireflies into a token, eating a live spider to activate a contract, or cutting off your own tongue to activate another Token.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsubstantialIngredients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsubstantialIngredients">Insubstantial Ingredients</a>:<ul><li> Commonly bought and sold at Goblin Markets. You might give the Hob the color of your eyes in exchange for seven minutes of good luck, trade away a springtime afternoon to buy the use of a Hedge Beast, or find a vendor willing to give away a Goblin Contract for a song (meaning, you can never learn or sing it again). In system, most of these just represent XP, but it's much more fun in game-terms to say you're giving away the scent of a rose in exchange for that Token.</li><li> These are also used in Hedgecrafting - you might get a ballgown woven from starlight and the glow of first love.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">Instant Expert</a>: One of the early Clauses of the Contract of Animation is to give the Changeling who uses it an innate knowledge of how to use a device. Combined with the ability to gain Skill and Merit bonuses through Pledgecraft, or to use a Merit to draw knowledge from the collective dreams of mankind, this means that a Changeling could go from computer illiterate to Googling away in a few moments, and become a fairly serviceable hacker overnight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangiblePrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangiblePrice">Intangible Price</a>: Goblin markets accept such items as eye colors, springtime afternoons, or a song.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">Invisible to Normals</a>: The Mask, mentioned above essentially fools all five human senses, rendering their mien invisible to the eyes, removing anything clearly supernatural from their voice, muffling any odd scents or tastes, and convincing a human's sense of touch into believing that odd features like fur or horns are simply unaltered skin. Supernatural creatures with special sensory powers can pierce the mask, but it's <em>extremely</em> difficult.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a>: The book Swords At Dawn introduces a new mechanic called Talecrafting, which essentially lets canny players spot Tropes in motion (or good places to shoehorn them in) and tweak the Wyrd to cause them to come to pass. Changelings often get the inspirations for this power when they realize that they're, in a sorts, LIVING in a Faerie Tale, as they are Fae creatures. For example, a Changeling loses two huge bets at Vegas, but suddenly realizes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">the Third Time's The Charm</a> and goes for one last bet, hoping to win it all just like in all the stories. Conversely, the same Changeling might set up events to fool the Wyrd into thinking it should enact the trope, such as using rigged 'failure' dice, intentionally blowing bets, etc. The Wyrd doesn't like it when it catches you doing this, and so inflicts a dice penalty on the attempt. The system has a dangerous caveat: unless the player gets very lucky on their Wyrd roll, their success comes with a Cruel Twist of Fate, such as the casino busting the Changeling for 'cheating', who gets a blunt lesson in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters">All That Glitters</a>. Needless to say, the possibilities in this system are as endless as this very website's bottomless resources, and this site indeed is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/NotableReferencesToTVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/NotableReferencesToTVTropes">LINKED TO in the book itself as a resource.</a> Ladies and Gentlemen, things just got Meta.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a>: Pledges bind you to the word of the agreement: no more, no less. That makes it fairly simple for a Changeling to take a poorly-worded Pledge and play this straight.<ul><li> In a more specific example, You always have to be careful of this when buying something at a Goblin Market. Market Law says that all products and services must work as advertised, but there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">Ain't No Rule</a> that says the merchant has to fully disclose all negative qualities and side-effects of a purchase.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">Sanity Meter</a>: Clarity. This tracks how much a character has mentally grown to resemble her Fae captors, both in her moral uprightness and her ability to tell reality from the dreams and hallucinations that come from her fae perceptions.<ul><li> It is worth noting that Clarity is somewhat unique amongst the various World of Darkness Morality tracks in that it can drop through no fault of the player- their sanity has become much more fragile, and general disruptions and chaos that disrupts their day to day routine can be just as jarring and detrimental to their mind as actively doing something reprehensible.<ul><li> Clarity is also far less forgiving than some of the other Morality scales of the NWoD because it doesn't know the meaning of "extenuating circumstances", unless you're acting in accordance with your Virtue, which will usually give you bonuses to degeneration rolls but not avoid the need to roll at all.</li></ul></li><li> Clarity is also unique in that <em>beneficial</em> events can trigger potential drops (if they're not expected). Having to move to a new home (even if you're acquiring a nicer residence) triggers a chance at degeneration if your Clarity is 7 or above. Unplanned pregnancy explicitly is actually a larger trigger for degeneration (Clarity 4) than killing another changeling (Clarity 5). Changelings greatly desire a stable environment and routine.<ul><li> On the plus side, as seen above under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">Creative Sterility</a>, having an <em>un</em>planned pregnancy is <em>really</em> hard for a changeling.</li></ul></li><li> Clarity is reworked in Second Edition to function more like Health, with each box able to take Mild or Severe damage. Meaningful interaction with a Changeling's Touchstones allows them to heal Clarity damage, and taking damage in their rightmost boxes causes them to take Conditions that affect their mental state. Interestingly, having all their boxes filled with Severe damage doesn't kill them - it simply puts them into a coma and allows a Huntsman to take them without resistance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a>: The True Fae, Fetchspawn, and many low-Clarity Lost are like this, generally taking the form of some degree of solipsism. How varies:<ul><li> True Fae are fundamentally incapable of understanding the feelings and minds of other beings, and due to the way their biology works, hate is literally the same thing as love.</li><li> Fetchspawn are the True Fae's solipsism taken to extremes-they aren't even aware other beings exist.</li><li> Low-Clarity lost are so wrapped up in their own warped perceptions that they don't see other people as people.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie">Land of Faerie</a>: With many names: Arcadia, Faerie, Elfhome, Hell, That Terrible Fucking Place...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">Law of Inverse Fertility</a>: If you want a child, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">you'll pay to get it</a>.

Be <em><strong>very</strong></em> careful how you word your pledges, folks. On both sides: not only is tricking someone into an unfair Pledge a Clarity sin (that's True Fae bullshit), but the repercussions are just as bad if the Pledgemaker breaks the agreement (say, by withholding or downgrading the promised reward for completing a task). Feel free to promise "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsANewHope">more wealth than you can imagine</a>," but have a solid grasp on the extent of the other party's imagination first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLabyrinth">Living Labyrinth</a>: The Hedge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy">Living Toy</a>: Many Elementals, from Manikins to Metalflesh tin soldiers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>: This is Pledgecraft, in a nutshell.<ul><li> Also, Contracts, Changeling's magical powers. Each Clause (power) in a Contract has a Catch, which if met allows you to activate the contract for free. Clever players can find ways to have Catches active very frequently, letting them use their powers much more freely than other splats.<ul><li> In 2nd Edition, they're even renamed to Loopholes (which makes more sense anyway).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfInhibitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfInhibitions">Loss of Inhibitions</a>: In the Hedge, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a> between the mortal world and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie">Land of Faerie</a>, humans' perspectives are skewed to justify anything they do, so they can act completely freely with no harm to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>. As soon as they reenter the human world, however, all of their immoral actions hit them retroactively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lunacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lunacy">Lunacy</a>: The Contracts of the Moon deal specifically with derangements, the clauses ranging from telling if someone is suffering from one with just a look to infecting a crowd with a madness of your choice.<ul><li> There is also a Darkling kith called the Moonborn. Their power lets them infect themselves with a mild derangement and someone they touch with its severe version.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">The Lost Woods</a>: The Hedge, in all its psychoreactive, space-twisting, soul-ripping glory. If you get lost in the Hedge, you may never leave again - at least, not as a human. And if you enter the Hedge, there's a *very* good chance you'll get lost.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyvering</a>: The highest level of artifice rivals the man himself in it's versatility. Need a gun? No problem, just take a lead pipe and a piece of string. An Airplane?

The Goblin Contract "Diviner's Madness," does just fine on its own: It gives you visions of the future, past, or present, but it drives you (temporarily) insane.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEnhancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEnhancement">Magical Enhancement</a>: Several different Contracts can do this, as can certain pledges.<ul><li> The "Tokenmaster" merit from <em>Equinox Road</em> means that any object kept in close contact for a number of days equal to 10 - minus the changeling Clarity days, the object might turn int a token (on a roll of 8 or higher on a single dice), However, the Changeling can't control what Token the object turns into, plus the tokens could get into the hands of the changelings enemies, or into the hands of mortals that stumble across there catches.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalRomani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalRomani">Magical Romani</a>: "Grandma Mara" the elderly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FortuneTeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FortuneTeller">Fortune Teller</a> deliberately dresses like a Roma stereotype when she sets up her tent.

Conversely, it could also be given as the reason the True Fae took interest in a Changeling character to begin with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalUnderpinningsOfReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalUnderpinningsOfReality">Magical Underpinnings of Reality</a>: This is how <em>everything</em> in Arcadia works. You need to establish a contract with Fire to be warmed, a contract with Carrots to eat one. But no contract is needed with Rock in order for the True Fae there to crush you with one.<ul><li> Even worse, actually. Fire in Arcadia may not warm you if you have no Contract with it, but it <em>can</em> still burn you. You may not be able to drink water to stay alive without a Water Contract, but it can still drown you. Basically, anything in Arcadia can decide to interact with you normally if it wants to... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">mostly so it can proceed to hurt you.</a> Gaining the positive aspects of Contracts with the matter of Arcadia (being able to get warm, eat, drink, etc.) requires to True Fae including you in their Contracts with the realm... which makes you theirs by default. So even if you weren't dragged into Arcadia to be a True Fae's plaything, you'll become one anyway. Or die.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyBindingContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyBindingContract">Magically Binding Contract</a>: Pledges are a borderline case. While a Pledge won't supernaturally compel or fate the oathbound to fulfill their ends of the bargain, it <em>will</em> hit them with a supernatural Sanction if they break their word. As these sanctions can range from minor curses to death, they're often a pretty powerful motivation.<ul><li> Particularly nasty fae can also bind mortals into contracts they aren't aware they are making. Badly chosen words, like screaming 'I'm gonna kill him!' can be bound into bargains that will punish someone for not carrying out their promise.<ul><li> In the flavor, one character gets himself into a bargain that will have a Changeling or fae (it's not clear which) kill the "pests" in her home. The last thing he says to a friend before the 'exterminator' arrives? "You're such a pest."</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror">Magic Mirror</a>: It's a Fairy-tale-inspired game. Are you really surprised?<ul><li> Specifically, there are a couple magical Tokens made of mirrors, one or two Contracts that use mirrors as foci or required components, and some Fetches have power over mirrors, as an extension of their nature as "reflections" of their Changeling counterparts.<ul><li> In 2nd Edition, Darklings favor the Contracts of Mirror, which include things like looking into a mirror and seeing out of another one elsewhere, or seeing past events in a reflective surface. Some Contracts outside of the Mirror Regalia use mirrors as well, like using mirrors as portals or stealing objects' reflections to summon them as physical items.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicTouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicTouch">The Magic Touch</a>: Many of the Contracts of Artifice offer temporary equipment buffs in this manner, though performing actual adjustments (however needless) generally makes the process better or cheaper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a>: Glamour, the energy of Faerie, also connected to emotions and dreams. Changelings can recover glamour by absorbing it from the emotions or dreams of mortals, by fulfilling some Pledges, or by eating strange Goblin Fruits which grow in the Hedge between our world and Faerie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>: A variation - Changelings are, in general, not overly worried about human reactions to their presence. However, word of a horn-browed man transforming into autumn leaves and blowing away might travel the rumor mill until one of the True Fae learn of it, and <em>that's</em> what Changelings keep quiet for. Lucky for them they have the Mask to help (and Winter Courtiers to clean up if that fails)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerFailure">Matchmaker Failure</a>: The Crimson Weavers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">fae entities</a> who are obsessed with the concept of "soul mates" and can mystically bind couples with a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate">Red String of Fate</a>. However, they have no clue what people actually <em>like</em> in each other, so those pairings are usually unfulfilling, and many go insane or kill their partners to escape their alleged "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">One True Love</a>".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a>: This is what a fight between a Changeling and her Fetch probably looks like for anyone who isn't able to pierce the Mask.

Getting lost there is pretty easy, and <em>not</em> a good idea.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstersAnonymous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstersAnonymous">Monsters Anonymous</a>: The various Courts, Entitlements, and Motleys of the Lost serve, in part, to provide this sort of assistance to the Lost who join them. Certain members within the Spring and Winter courts especially offer aid in reintegrating with Mortal society or gaining appropriate documentation with which to blend in (respectively, with some overlap).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFixit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFixit">Mr. Fixit</a>: Wizened.

When you've been turned into an animal, an inanimate object or force, or a boogeyman, your adjusted instincts are going to be... off, compared to normal. This is especially clear in the Beast and Elemental kith Curses - the Beasts are so tied to animal instinct that mortal thought has atrophied somewhat, and the Elementals have spent so long as inhuman embodiments of creation that they have trouble identifying with humans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mythpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mythpunk">Mythpunk</a>: A distinct possibility for how to run Changeling games.

The Darklings were taken for breaking some unknown law and submerged in nightmares. The Elementals were transformed into pure natural forces and still remain divorced from human thought patterns. The Fairest were used as sex slaves and underwent Durances that bounced between utter luxury and unimaginable hell. The Ogres were all, by definition, abuse victims. And the Wizened were turned into slaves and craftsmen, subjected to random spite, and often tricked into thinking they'd escaped from Arcadia, only to have their Keepers collapse the illusion in the cruelest way possible.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInYourDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInYourDreams">Talking in Your Dreams</a>: Possible through oneiromancy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar">Tautological Templar</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Talecrafting addicts.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a>: Freeholds and Motleys often work out this way.

Unable to cross a line of ants? Must drink alcohol instead of water?<ul><li> Also, the universal anti-fae power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a>- that is, iron that has not been worked into steel or any other alloy. Against normal Changelings, you lose any defensive benefits and are reduced to your base, human stats; against the True Fae, it does the same, plus if it's hand-worked without the benefit of machinery (or even fire), it deals Aggravated (nigh-irreparable) damage. Why? Because, in layman's terms, the True Fae once cheated the entire concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a> in a business deal, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a> got pissed and swore revenge... or something like that. For the True Fae, reality is like a fairy tale and makes almost as much sense. A result of this is that the best iron for taking out Fae comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderboltIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderboltIron">meteorites</a>.<ul><li> No True Fae understands this greater than Dzar&ucirc;mazh the Deathless, a giant dragon of immense power, who, after a fight with a changeling went badly, ended up with the tip of a cold iron spear inside his body. It is slowly worming its way towards his heart, which will kill him. He is searching for a way to make a pact with cold iron, and if he succeeds now only will he save his own life, but he will become immune to the True Fae's greatest weakness.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>: ... Or perhaps Wyrd-ness censor - the Mask helps enforce this by making all things Fae seem perfectly mundane unless actively using some supernatural power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidYouExpectWhenYouNamedIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidYouExpectWhenYouNamedIt">What Did You Expect When You Named It New Lyonesse?</a>: It's because of situations like this that Changelings avoid naming their freeholds after myths, legends, or fairy tales - the Wyrd sometimes like to make sure the story repeats itself. Mention is made of "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">grave fate</a> that befell New <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyonesse">Lyonesse<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome">What Have I Become?</a>: Many Changelings suffer psychological issues due to the alterations that have been forced upon them (even the beautiful Fairest). Surgery, drugs and self-mutilation are common among the most disturbed of Elementals, for example - imagine having <em>leaves and branches</em> growing out of you, or constantly oozing toxic waste from every pore. Now add to that, you were a conscious, immobile candle for the last thirty years. No wonder so many Changelings go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a>...<ul><li> Changelings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">invariably</a> tend to have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">issues</a></em>.

As an entity that absorbs qualities of her prey (it's how she became sentient in the first place), and with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality">Theory of Narrative Causality</a> being known to changelings, the fact she can take a human(like) form has led to the rumors that she isn't merely a beast hard-wired by her appetites, that she embodies the archetype of the fae princess as well as the fae monster. This is true &mdash; the fae princess archetype is one of the older ones that she digested &mdash; but raises the possibility that she may have the untapped potential for unselfish love. Though storyteller's have fiat, naturally, it's official that she really could fall in genuine love with somebody, much to her great shock. The potential consequences are "many, varied, enticing and frightening".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">The Wild Hunt</a>: Definitely shows up. See "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a>" above.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange">Winds of Destiny, Change</a>: The Contracts of Hearth allow one of the Lost to grant good or bad luck - but use them wrong or too often, and the effects reverse. For some of the weaker clauses, this simply makes things more flexible (you can grant a curse rather than a blessing). For others, the ill luck affects YOU. The Wyrd knows, and it does not enjoy being used.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinterRoyalLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinterRoyalLady">Winter Royal Lady</a>: Any queen of the Winter Court, fairly obviously. Female Elemental Snowskins (or other Lost women with cold powers) can also play up to this archetype, though the books note that just as many intentionally avoid the Winter Court to avoid it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>: The more powerful a Changeling gets, the easier it becomes for their Clarity to drop and the harder it becomes for them to distinguish between reality and fantasy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A Changeling that grows too powerful and has too little Clarity has the disturbing possibility on becoming one of the True Fae.</span><ul><li> Second Edition plays with this a bit. Clarity functions more akin to Health than before, with boxes taking Clarity Damage from various assaults. The interesting aspect is that the die pool for said damage is based on the <em>Changeling's own Wyrd</em>, meaning that the stronger a Changeling becomes the harder their Clarity will be hit with each blow.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">Changelings Live Longer</a>: The Wyrd increases the lifespan of Changelings, depending on the strength of their fae nature. At the peak of a Changeling's potential power, he can live up to 140 years beyond his natural lifespan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Assuming he hasn't transformed into another True Fae by then.</span><ul><li> It gets weirder then that, there is no limit to how long they can be in Arcadia, so long as more then one hundred years have not passed in the human world since they where taken. They can have an internal durance that lasts for centuries and come back just a few seconds later, having lived and suffered for centuries and not coming out any older or younger. THEN when you add onto the age extension that comes with high Wyrd, and certain contracts and goblin fruits, you can live a pretty damn long time in this game... assuming you WANT to live that long in the first place.</li><li> And that hundred year limit is only there to minimize the problems arising from more extreme cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Fish out of Temporal Water</a>.</li><li> In fact, it's possible to come out of the Hedge <em>before you left,</em> and your past self might have gotten captured because they wandered into the Hedge after catching a glimpse of your <em>current</em> self. Or you might wind up walking out <em>years</em> before you left. Good luck explaining <em>that</em> one to your family, and the Wyrd makes it near impossible to stop your past self from getting taken, no matter what you try...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkplaceAcquiredAbilities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkplaceAcquiredAbilities">Workplace-Acquired Abilities</a>: How some Lost, especially those of the Wizened kith, "benefited" from their Durance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos">World of Chaos</a>: Arcadia. The True Fae only exist in relation to one another, and the only way they can keep from being subsumed back into the dreamstuff from whence they came is to constantly pit themselves against one another.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AYearAndADay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AYearAndADay">A Year and a Day</a>: One of the possible Durations of a Pledge, and the duration shows up in other places, as well. According to the books, the extra day is to account for Leap Years - if a pledge is sworn for only 365 days, it could unravel on the leap day, causing unwanted consequences.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside">Year Outside, Hour Inside</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarniaTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarniaTime">Narnia Time</a>: Time flows strangely while in Arcadia.<ul><li> And a bit closer to home: the Changeling Contracts of Hours (power over the flow of time) have a clause that allows you to cause this to happen while in the Hedge; you can either speed up or slow down subjective time while you're in the Hedge by anywhere from x2 to x6 times. But only for <em>you</em> and anyone who enters the Hedge with you, anyone already in the Hedge is unaffected by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarniaTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarniaTime">Narnia Time</a>. Meaning you can have a conversation with someone, both exit at the same time, and still wind up in the real world an hour before or after the other individual.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">You Keep Using That Word</a>: Oh so very many. But the sheer number of instances of the word "Catch" being used incorrectly is impressive.<ul><li> This has been addressed somewhat in Second Edition, where contracts no longer have Catches but Loopholes that allow them to be used without Glamour. It still applies for Tokens though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSexyBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSexyBeast">You Sexy Beast</a>: All changelings with the Beast seeming have as their blessing an animal magnetism that lets them increase their Presence and Composure.<div class="indent"> <em>"No, my place is a pigsty. Let's go to yours. So. What was your name again?"</em></div><ul><li> Sadly not a feature of Beasts in Second Edition, though the concept itself is far from barred.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">Your Days Are Numbered</a>: Dzar&ucirc;mazh the Deathless, is a True Fae of incredible power, who takes the form of a gigantic dragon. He is also carrying the tip of an cold iron spear inside him, which broke off when a changeling tried to slay the dragon, which is now slowly working it's way towards Dzar&ucirc;mazh's heart. He's spending his time looking for a way to make a pact with the element of cold iron, to save his life and leaving him immune to the True Fae's greatest weakness.</li></ul>
