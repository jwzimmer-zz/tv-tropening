The town consists of your regular teen hangouts, including Pete's Pizza, Fear Lake, and the Division Street Mall. All the students go to Shadyside High. Yep, it's a picture-perfect town... Except for the curse.</p><p>That's right, a curse! Years ago, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">the Fear family</a> was cursed during the Witch Trials, and that curse has lived on through the ages, destroying lives and driving people insane. And by 'people', that is every teenager who ever lived in Shadyside, and anyone who comes in contact with the Fear family. The two most infamous members of the Fear family were Simon Fear and his wife Angelica, who migrated to Shadyside from New Orleans following the Civil War and helped influence the town during its fledgling years. The titular Fear Street was named because they were the ones who financed it. The remains of their burned-out mansion were a staple in the early books, having been destroyed by a fire in 1900. The mansion was finally torn down in the <em>Fear Street Nights</em> miniseries and a shopping mall was built over it. The origin of the Fear family curse started in Wickham Village during the Salem witch trials, when Benjamin and Matthew Fier had Susannah Goode and her mother burned at the stake. This was really an attempt to keep Susannah away from Benjamin's son, Edward. The two brothers then looted the village and ran off. As it turned out, Susannah's father was the actual witch, and placed a curse on the Fiers for destroying his family. It doesn't help that Matthew promised to get Susannah freed in exchange for most of the family's valuables. Ever since, the Fears and Goodes have been stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a>, which was said could only be broken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">a marriage between a Fear and a Goode.</a> In 1900, Daniel Fear (Simon and Angelica's grandson) and Nora Goode fell in love and got married. They tried to end the feud, and the curse, with their marriage. They announced the marriage at Simon's birthday party. It didn't end well. (The Fear name was originally spelled F-I-E-R, which could be rearranged to spell "fire". Fire has always been linked to the family, and in an attempt to escape it, Simon changed the spelling.)</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The protagonists of the books are usually well-to-do teenagers who deal with threats both supernatural and completely human. Since most of the books all take place in the same town, it isn't unusual for characters from one book to be mentioned in passing in another.</p><p>A total of thirteen series (covering 156 books) have been published, either written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RLStine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RLStine">RLStine</a> or ghost writers. These series include:</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Fear Street</em> (51 books): The original series.</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearHall">Fear Hall</a></em>: A two-part story from the original 52-book series, its events are set at Ivy State University, fifty miles away from Shadyside, at the supposedly cursed dormitory Fear Hall. The story focuses on the suffering of one Hope Mathis, alongside her three roommates and best friends, as they deal with Hope's boyfriend Darryl going on a jealous rampage.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <em>New Fear Street</em> (4 books): A continuation of the original series.</li><li> <em>Fear Street Super Chillers</em> (13 books): Its volumes were usually longer than the normal ones, but the variety of horror and plot in these didn't differ that much from the main ones. However, they did have a tendency to have their chapters titled, and the point-of-view would sometimes shift between characters. A majority of them also happened to be seasonally themed.</li><li> <em>The Fear Street Saga</em> (3 books): Tells the origin of Simon and Angelica Fear, the story of their demise, and the origin of the Fear family curse, dating back to the Salem witch trials and a feud between the Fear and Goode families. These books were ghostwritten, with the actual author being shown on the copyright page.</li><li> <em>Fear Street Saga</em> (16 books): Stories focused on individual members of the Fear family in the past, or rather, someone who came in contact with them. The first book, <em>A New Fear</em>, was a direct sequel to the original trilogy, and the fourth, <em>The Sign of Fear</em>, revealed the origin of the family's power.</li><li> <em>Fear Street Cheerleaders</em> (3 books): Focuses on the Shadyside High cheerleading squad, specifically newcomer Corky Corcoran. The cheerleading squad would be pitted against an entity they referred to as "the evil", after their bus crashed into the Fear Street Graveyard and one of them landed on the grave of Sarah Fear, awakening an evil spirit that would routinely possess a member of the squad and cause her to commit mayhem and murder. The trilogy would get two sequel books in the <em>Super Chillers</em> title, and another in <em>Fear Street Sagas</em> explaining the origin of Sarah Fear.</li><li> <em>99 Fear Street: The House of Evil</em> (3 books): Focuses on a particular haunted house on Fear Street, which was built over a mass grave of victims of Simon and Angelica Fear.</li><li> <em>The Cataluna Chronicles</em> (3 books): Focuses on a possessed car, alternating between the damage it causes, and the origin of the spirit possessing it, a witch girl from Puritan times and the boy whose family she murdered.</li><li> <em>Fear Park</em> (3 books): A direct sequel to the first book in <em>Fear Street Sagas</em>, it details the bloody history behind an amusement park built on land that was cheated out of the Fear family's ownership during the 1930s.</li><li> <em>Ghosts of Fear Street</em> (35 books): Basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleGradeLiterature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleGradeLiterature">middle grade</a> take on Fear Street, featuring stories focusing on preteens living in Shadyside and not as bloody or violent as the regular books. Just like the above mentioned sagas, these were ghostwritten.</li><li> <em>Fear Street Seniors</em> (12 books): Focuses on the senior class of Shadyside High over the course of a year, as they are picked off one-by-one each month thanks to a curse accidentally cast by one of its members. The books each contained a section with a "Shadyside yearbook", with descriptions of each senior. When one senior is killed, they have a "deceased" stamped over their description.</li><li> <em>Fear Street Nights</em> (3 books): Focuses on the destruction of the Fear mansion and a shopping mall being built over it.</li><li> <em>A Fear Street Novel</em> (6 books): A continuation of the original series. It began in 2014, and marked Stine's first new work in the series since <em>Fear Street Nights</em> in 2005.</li><li> <em>Return to Fear Street</em> (currently 3 books): Another revival following the above series, with retro style covers.</li></ul><p>A film trilogy based on the series is <a class="urllink" href="https://deadline.com/2020/08/rl-stine-fear-street-movie-trilogy-netflix-chernin-entertainment-leigh-janiak-director-the-summer-of-fear-2021-1203010276/">currently in development<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with all three films planned to be released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> in the summer of 2021.</p><p></p><h2>This series provides examples of:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: The killer in <em>First Date</em> had a father who would often get drunk and beat him.
