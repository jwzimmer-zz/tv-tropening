His first appearance in the original comic strip was in the very first scene, but the strip ran for two years before it was established that his meek desk jockey persona was just a front for his real and much more capable personality. In the novels, the real Jack Fraser puts in an appearance at the end of the first chapter of the first novel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: Many of the novels take the best bits out of several different storylines from the comic strip and rearrange them into a new story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationPersonalityChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationPersonalityChange">Adaptation Personality Change</a>: One of the characters who appears in both continuities is Major the Earl St. Maur, with versions of the character appearing in the comic strip story "Death of a Jester" and the novel <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>. In both versions, he's a former commando and a cunning strategist. In "Death of a Jester", where he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he's also got a flamboyant personality and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">Complexity Addiction</a> that leads to his downfall; in the <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, and has a more pragmatic personality, becoming the underling who advocates a quick and simple death for the heroes and is ignored by the complexity-addicted Big Bad.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalContextChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalContextChange">Adaptational Context Change</a>: Occurs frequently in the novels, which recycle action set-pieces and plot elements from the strips but rearrange them and set them within new plots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoptAServant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoptAServant">Adopt-a-Servant</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, the villain has an adopted daughter who's actually a servant he bought as a slave and legally adopted as a way of having a socially-acceptable explanation for her presence in his household. He doesn't think of her as a daughter in any way; some of the services he forces her to perform are sexual. At the end of the novel, Modesty points out that the girl is probably going to end up with the villain's fortune (or as much of it as the lawful authorities are aware of), since in the eyes of the law, regardless of how he thought of her, she's a legitimate heir.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonizingStomachWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonizingStomachWound">Agonizing Stomach Wound</a>: Invoked in <em>I, Lucifer</em>. When Modesty and Willie are forced to duel each other to the death, she apparently shoots him in the stomach, and he reacts with horror at the lingering death facing him before throwing himself off the nearby cliff to a quicker death. Actually, he was pretending the injury as an excuse to escape over the cliff, which he knew something the villains didn't about his chances of surviving.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">Agony of the Feet</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, the villains use toenail-pulling as one of their interrogation techniques.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbinosAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbinosAreFreaks">Albinos Are Freaks</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, Lisa Brunel, one of the villain's associates, is an albino. It turns out that he has manipulated her from a young age to make her into a useful tool, and encouraged her to think of herself as an unlovable freak as one of his techniques for keeping her socially isolated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy">Almost Dead Guy</a>: In <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">CIA agent Ben Christie</span> is shot by the villains but lingers long enough to tell Modesty everything he knows.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>: The books are in a separate continuity from the comic strip. This is established straight off; both versions of the series begin with Sir Giles Tarrant approaching Modesty to request her assistance for the first time, but in the novel the problem requiring assistance is different, as is the favour he does her to secure her help. From there, characters and settings from the comic strip show up in the novels but in different contexts and storylines; often a particularly good action sequence from the comic strip will be reprised in a novel surrounded by a completely different plot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysIdenticalTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysIdenticalTwins">Always Identical Twins</a>: In <em>The Night of Morningstar</em> there is a notorious pair of professional killers known as the Polish Twins. They are identical twins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh">Arab Oil Sheikh</a>: Sheikh Abu-Tahir in the first novel is the leader of a small Arabic tribe who recently hit oil and the big time in that order. Definitely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a>. He mixes elements of the wealthy lifestyle with elements of the traditional life of his tribe; for instance, when he comes to England to negotiate an oil deal with the British government, he and his retinue take a suite at the Ritz and then set up a traditional encampment inside it, complete with tents and goats.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a>: Mr. Sexton in <em>The Silver Mistress</em> is a particularly unpleasant example of this, considering himself to be the greatest fighter in the world (possibly correctly) while being also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately for him, he wasn't as good at swimming.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arrowgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arrowgram">Arrowgram</a>: In <em>I, Lucifer</em>, Willie passes a message to a friend in hostile territory by wrapping it around one of his throwing knives and throwing it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays">As the Good Book Says...</a>: Willie can supply a quotation from the Book of Psalms to fit any situation. He once spent a year in an Indian prison with nothing to read except a psalter and so has all of the psalms memorised.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Bare-Fisted Monk</a>: The Polish Twins in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em> are a pair of professional killers who use no weapons, having honed their bodies and their martial arts skills to the point where their bodies <em>are</em> weapons. It means that they need to get close to their targets, but they can kill in moments at a moment's notice, and it's very hard to prove when they're up to something because they're never carrying any suspicious equipment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>: Modesty and Willie are close friends who have been working and fighting together for years. In a fight, they always have each other's backs and often pull off co-ordinated moves with the slightest of communication.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>: In <em>A Taste for Death</em>, Modesty's plan for rescuing everyone from the villains depends at several points on specific villains reacting appropriately. To some extent this involves general predictions about obvious trends like Delicata preferring slow and amusing deaths for his enemies over just killing them outright, but it also involves specific predictions like getting McWhirter to let his guard down in a particular way at a particular moment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleStrip">Battle Strip</a>: Modesty often strips down before fighting. In <em>A Taste for Death</em>, she goes topless to duel the fencer Wenczel, and facing the lethal Mr. Sexton in <em>The Silver Mistress</em> she goes completely naked (and greased up) to avoid presenting him with anything he could get a grip on.

After Modesty points out the trap he fell into, he admits that he's actually an ESP researcher but doesn't like how the conversation usually goes if he says so in social situations, so when people ask what he does he says he's a metallurgist and that's usually the end of the subject.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac">Qurac</a>: The Sheikdom of Malaurak in the first novel, a small Arabian country inhabited by nomadic tribes which has recently become part of the modern world due to the discovery of oil.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RambunctiousItalian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RambunctiousItalian">Rambunctious Italian</a>: In <em>A Taste for Death</em>, Modesty's fencing instructor, Professor Barbi, has a hot and easily-provoked temper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecruitedFromTheGutter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecruitedFromTheGutter">Recruited from the Gutter</a>: When Modesty met Willie, he was living a directionless and violent life, but she recognised his potential and recruited him to her organisation, where he quickly became her right-hand man and best friend.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver">Red and Black and Evil All Over</a>: In <em>I, Lucifer</em>, Lucifer dresses entirely in red and black as part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilComplex">Devil Complex</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>: In <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, there is a notorious pair of professional killers known as the Polish Twins. Admittedly, they're called that partly because most people find "the Zdrzalkywicz twins" too much of a mouthful, but it does function as a badass nickname: Willie notes that if you mention "the Polish twins", anybody who's ever encountered them will know exactly who you mean.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a>: In <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, the villains' plan turns out to be masterminded by a high-ranking Russian intelligence officer, with the long-term goal of easing the way for the USSR to annex Romania and Yugoslavia. He predicts that with him masterminding things the USSR will have Western Europe, including Britain, sewn up within a decade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadsideSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadsideSurgery">Roadside Surgery</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, Modesty and Dr Giles Pennyfeather have to perform an emergency appendectomy in a cave where they and the patient are hiding from the villains. Giles has to talk Modesty through the surgery because his hands haven't recovered from being tortured by the villains. Modesty does note that there is one up-side to the situation: Giles got most of his surgical experience as a mission doctor in a remote African village, so he's used to working in primitive conditions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: The series-long running gag of Willie saying that the current circumstances remind him of an improbable thing that happened one time involving one of his many girlfriends.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyDying">Secretly Dying</a>: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> "Cobra Trap", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Modesty is killed in action shortly after revealing to Willie that she's already dying, from an inoperable brain tumor</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfThievingSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfThievingSkill">Secret Test of Thieving Skill</a>: In <em>Sabre-Tooth</em>, Modesty and Willie are captured by a villain who wants to see if their reputation for inventiveness is deserved before recruiting them. He locks them in a cell but deliberately leaves a means of escape to see if they will discover it. They do, then decide that is too obvious and must be a trap, and proceed to invent their own means of escape. The bad guy is very impressed, and makes them an offer they can't refuse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillingsSpecificTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillingsSpecificTarget">Serial Killings, Specific Target</a>: Done on a grand scale in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>. The Watchmen are a terrorist group with no discernable ideology who have committed a number of attacks for no clear purpose; it turns out that they're being run at arm's length by the Soviet Union and most of their attacks are to confuse things so that it won't be obvious when they commit an attack that advances the Soviet Union's aims.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: In "The Soo Girl Charity", Modesty cautions Willie against engaging in vigilantism for the sake of it by saying that they aren't "the Four Just Men", a reference to the thriller of the same name by Edgar Wallace.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowSomeLeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowSomeLeg">Show Some Leg</a>: Modesty Blaise would occasionally get the drop on the bad guys by stripping prior to a fight, a manoeuvre known as The Nailer. Depending on how easily-distracted the bad guys were, she would sometimes keep her underwear on, and sometimes not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTeam">Sibling Team</a>: The Polish Twins in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, twin brothers who work as a team of killers for hire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleStaff">Simple Staff</a>: Quarterstaff combat features in <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SissyVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SissyVillain">Sissy Villain</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Mrs. Fothergill</a> in <em>Modesty Blaise</em> has a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbian</a> signifiers, but she doesn't seem to show any sexual interest in anyone, and doesn't enjoy many things other than killing people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">Slipping a Mickey</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, the heroes are captured by the villain after drinking coffee that was drugged by a character they'd trusted up to that point.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess">Smart People Play Chess</a>: Played with in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Golitsyn, is shown in one scene playing chess while waiting for news on the outcome of a mission &mdash; and playing dirty, distracting his opponent with insults because he's not confident of winning fairly and has too much ego to accept losing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a>: Willie's ears sometimes prickle when something bad is about to go down. It doesn't always happen, but when it does it's never a false alarm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake">Spit Take</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, when Modesty and Willie are discussing what to do about the villain over a glass of wine, and their resolutely non-action-hero friend Giles casually offers to help dispose of the body just as Willie is taking a sip.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster">The Spymaster</a>: Sir Gerald Tarrant, something high up in the British secret service, who occasionally passes jobs to Modesty and Willie that his agents are unable to handle. He's the hidden-heart-of-gold type: soft-hearted enough to feel bad about manipulating people for the greater good, but not so soft-hearted to stop doing it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>: Adrian Chance in <em>The Impossible Virgin</em> starts out as a loyal (if secretly resentful) right-hand man to the villain Brunel, but starts plotting against his boss after Brunel decides to try and brainwash Modesty Blaise into his new right-hand person. He does successfully overthrow Brunel after a lucky chance gives him an unexpected advantage, but it's noted that he's not in Brunel's league and if he hadn't been killed by Modesty shortly afterward he probably would have messed things up for himself before too long.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution">Stating the Simple Solution</a>:<ul><li> In <em>A Taste For Death</em>, the second banana villain&mdash;who has been defeated by them before&mdash;practically jumps up and down shouting, "Kill them now!" or (later) "They're up to something, kill them now!" But he's overruled. It goes poorly for him.</li><li> Major the Earl St. Maur, in <em>Night of Morningstar</em>, argues for dropping Modesty &amp; Willie over the side the instant the Watchmen finish determining whether or not our heroes managed to send a message before being captured. (They hadn't.) He is overruled by his superior Colonel Golitsyn, who wishes to keep Modesty &amp; Willie alive for use in an elaborate disinformation plot. Karmically, Golitsyn was one of the first of the Watchmen's senior leaders to die in Modesty &amp; Willie's inevitable escape; St. Maur was the last.</li><li> Modesty and Willie are occasionally asked this in both the novels and comic strip. In the first novel, Modesty also basically asks Willie this during a fight with a pair of thugs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealTheSurroundings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealTheSurroundings">Steal the Surroundings</a>: In <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, Modesty and Willie have to steal some sensitive documents from a safe in the villain's house. With the villain on the alert, it's considered impossible to get into the house, let alone get enough uninterrupted time to crack the safe (it was originally installed when the house belonged to a jewel merchant, and is a heavy-duty model built directly into a wall) &mdash; so they use a crane and demolition ball to smash through the wall, and steal the entire safe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissBankAccount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissBankAccount">Swiss Bank Account</a>: In <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, it's mentioned in passing that the terrorist group's members are all being paid into Swiss bank accounts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight">Sword Fight</a>: In <em>A Taste for Death</em>, Modesty's half of the climactic action set pieces is a sword fight to the death with one of the villains.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: In a fight scene in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, Modesty has to leave her guard down for a moment in order to concentrate on destroying the radio transmitter vital to the villains' plans, and the one mook still standing tries to shoot her in the back. Ben Christie, who was sitting out the fight and ignored by everyone due to his injuries from an earlier conflict, throws himself between Modesty and the bullet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerroristsWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerroristsWithoutACause">Terrorists Without a Cause</a>: Discussed in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em> in regard to the Watchmen, a terrorist group who claim a different motivation for each attack and have espoused causes from all over the political spectrum including several that are mutually exclusive. Tarrant tells Modesty that investigations have established that it really is a single group behind all the attacks, and that they're not just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Murder, Inc.</a> whose goals change depending on who's paying them, but nobody knows what they're really out to achieve. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that they're being run at arm's length by the USSR, with the aim that once they've established their legend they'll start carrying out attacks that serve the USSR's purposes disguised among the random ones.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickAndFollowPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickAndFollowPloy">Trick-and-Follow Ploy</a>: In "The Giggle-Wrecker", the villains turn out to have been attempting this, setting up a situation where they figured Sir Gerald would have no choice but to activate one of his sleeper agents and in the process reveal their identity to Soviet intelligence. Sir Gerald, without knowing of the plan but instinctively reluctant to expose his sleeper agents if another way exists, puts a spoke in the plan by giving the job to Modesty and Willie instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutShoes">Tricked-Out Shoes</a>: In several of the stories, Modesty and/or Willie have trick shoes with secret compartments in the heels (or even heels that detach and then can be combined into a useful gadget). In <em>A Taste for Death</em>, Willie has a pair of shoes with lockpicks hidden in the sole, and a pair of combat boots where the soles contain the blade and handle of a knife.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable">The Unpronounceable</a>: In <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>, the Polish Twins are a notorious team of professional killers who are identical twin brothers. Everyone calls them "the Polish Twins" because most people find "the Zdrzalkywicz twins" too much of a mouthful.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">Unspoken Plan Guarantee</a>: Demonstrated both ways in <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>. The villains' Operation Morningstar is described in great detail, and is comprehensively derailed by Modesty and Willie just as it's getting started with the result that none of the planned events occur. Conversely, Modesty's plan for the derailing is conveyed to Willie in two cryptic sentences about a conversation they had with a friend before the book started, and the reader doesn't get a description of what it actually involves until after it's kicked off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>: In <em>A Taste for Death</em>, the big bad behind the whole plot turns out to be a famous businessman and philanthropist with no criminal record, who is careful to make sure there's no evidence pointing back to him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">Virtue Is Weakness</a>: Brunel, the villain of <em>The Impossible Virgin</em>, is a cold-blooded criminal mastermind who regards the compassionate virtues as weaknesses that he's glad not to share. He understands how they work well enough to manipulate his opponents with them (including at one point luring Modesty and Willie into a trap), which just makes him more sure that they're a weakness to be avoided. Even loyalty doesn't mean anything to him; he feels no loyalty to anyone, and prefers to rely on fear and greed in controlling his subordinates, which is what gets him killed in the end.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">What Measure Is a Mook?</a>: Averted. Modesty and Willie frequently decide whether to kill or spare enemies based on moral judgements of them as individuals rather than their importance to the plot, often killing depraved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> while sparing minions who might not have been aware of how bad their employer was. Shown off in the French Riviera section of the very first book, where Willie slightly injures and humiliates a mook assigned to spy on him via a comedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>, but shortly afterwards Modesty deliberately kills one who had cold-bloodedly murdered a vulnerable young woman for informing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase">Working the Same Case</a>: At the beginning of <em>A Taste for Death</em>, Willie foils a kidnapping he stumbles across while on holiday, and Modesty gets asked by Sir Gerald to look into a problem a friend of his is having. The kidnapping turns out to be part of the same problem.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootAGoodGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootAGoodGuy">Would Not Shoot a Good Guy</a>: "I Had a Date with Lady Janet" describes a situation dating back to when Modesty was the leader of a criminal gang in which a lucrative robbery job was cancelled due to Modesty being unable to work out a plan that didn't involve police officers being hurt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Near the end of <em>I, Lucifer</em>, when the villains are abandoning their base before the authorities arrive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Seff casually shoots his underling Bowker and remarks that his usefulness is ended, since his skills were vital for the scam they were running but they won't be able to do it again, and now he is just a loose end that needs tidying up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle">You No Take Candle</a>: In <em>I, Lucifer</em>, the leader of the native islanders speaks like this. "Is right about small boat. We find along shore."</li></ul><hr>
