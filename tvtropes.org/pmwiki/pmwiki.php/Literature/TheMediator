Whilst everyone else calls her by her nickname, Suze, Father Dominic and Jesse insist on calling her Susannah, which seems to be a sign of affection from them both. It is mentioned specifically that Father Dominic never calls her 'Suze' because he thinks it sounds vulgar.</li><li> As time goes by, Suze's nicknames for her stepbrothers - Sleepy, Dopey, and Doc - become more like this. It's certainly the case for Doc, a.k.a.

Whenever anyone witnesses the odd events that occur with supernatural interference, chances are that they'll start believing. Biggest examples are Doc (David), who starts believing after Jesse comes to him and gets him to help Suze where she is trapped under a collapsed section of the Mission Academy's roof, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cee Cee</span>, after the incident at the house party at the end of <em>Haunted/Grave Doubts</em>- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having witnessed events that could not be explained any other way, and seeing Suze talk to someone who wasn't there (Jesse, who Suze had told her about), she is forced to conclude that Jesse is a ghost and Suze can see them.

Despite having been born and lived over a century and a half ago, Suze points out that he didn't stay stuck in the past, but followed along with every new advance and change, and loves to read. He's actually ingrained enough in the modern setting that Suze finds herself forgetting sometimes that many pop-culture references go right over his head. However, at the same time, not only does he use his considerable telekinetic abilities to help Suze out of a very tight spot, he fights alongside her on multiple occasions, and <em>twice</em> defeats <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man who murdered him</span>, both times in a fair fight. Not to mention that he nearly beats <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Paul</span> into a bloody pulp, who even Suze had trouble getting away from on one occasion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>: Mediators in general, who aside from being able to see ghosts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> have no superhuman powers the way that ghosts do. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shifters like Suze and Paul, who do: they can travel through time, transfer souls, and are implied to have even more additional gifts beyond that of the normal mediator</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher">Badass Preacher</a>: Father Dominic. He's <em>very</em> protective of his students, especially Suze, despite being a pacifist and openly distasteful of Suze's general 'kick ass, ask questions later' approach to uncooperative spirits.

Therefore most of the handsome boys Suze ends up meeting who also have wealthy and/or well-connected families have a good reason- most of the families in the area do (or, in Paul's case during the fourth book <em>Darkest Hour/Young Blood</em>, are rich enough to be staying in the luxury hotel for the summer), and it just so happens that they're the good looking ones of her age.</li><li> Jesse really has no excuse though, other than good genes.

Not including any incidents that have happened before the start of the series (so, within the space of about a year, maybe a little less), Suze has had a roof collapse on her, been almost drowned no less than three times, beaten badly enough to receive two bruised ribs, thrown off a porch roof and into a six-foot deep pit and survived, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">travelled through time</span> in such a method that is known to be able to destroy brain cells if done one too many times, almost died of smoke inhalation (twice), and jumped from the top of a two-story barn without so much as a bruise to show for it. Father Dominic has been through his fair share of scrapes, too, for that matter, and has always come out okay, which is remarkable given his age.

It gets easier to know who's who when she starts calling them by their real names.

Both of them are stress smokers, notably stubborn, and despite their difference in approach and attitude (Father Dominic uses words; Suze uses her fists- although, to be fair, she grew up in a New York, where the ghosts were probably more malicious and needed a decent beat-down) they both simply assume that it is their job to help souls reach their final destination.</li><li> Paul Slater tries to pull this with Suze, and has a legitimate point.

He towers over Suze, has dark hair and is <em>incredibly</em> good looking. Even Cee Cee agrees after seeing a portrait of him from back when he was alive. His sarcastic comments often cause him to overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky">Tall, Dark, and Snarky</a>, though he enjoys teasing Suze a little too much to fit the full profile.</li><li> Bryce Martinson from <em>Shadowland/Love You to Death</em> qualifies, being six foot and very cute, although he has sandy-blonde hair. Suze describes him as a "true Baldwin".</li><li> Paul. He fits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky">Snarky</a> aspect, too.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a>: Doc (David).

She's never given a first name, although Father Dominic refers to her as 'Mrs Ackerman' in one of the very first chapters. She may have kept her maiden name for her television news reporter career, and Suze simply wanted to keep her father's name. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was <em>Paul Slater</em> who provoked him.

Suze is blackmailed into staying quiet about it, and when it finally takes place at the end of the book, it predictably gets out of control; Brad suffers severe punishment, and Jake has to pay for the damages from his Camero savings. However, it should probably be notes that most of the eventual problems and damage is caused by spiritual beings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Jesse wants to exorcise <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lucia, who is an eight-year old ghost</span> for attempting to drown Suze in her apartment's swimming pool. Suze lampshades that it's not a healthy reaction for a pediatric resident. He only relents upon reading how she died.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lucia</span> in <em>Remembrance</em>. Murderous violent ghost that chases anyone that could hurt her friend Becca, condemning Becca to a life of loneliness? Yes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Brutally murdered after she was going to out a pedophile that had molested Becca and many others, which the pedophile making her death look like an accident and putting down her horse?</span> Also yes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>: Heather, both in life and death.

As explained via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">Inner Monologue</a> when Suze first meets Jesse in her new room, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">unsympathetic</a> reaction is mostly down to the fact that she gets this <em>a lot</em>. Plus, he's ruined any hope of her having a somewhat normal life in Carmel barely half an hour after stepping off a plane, and she's very jet lagged.</li></ul><hr>
