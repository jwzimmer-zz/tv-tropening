O'Brian also wrote the first couple of chapters of a 21st book before his death, which have since been published, along with his notes about what happened afterward.</p><p>The books start with Jack first meeting Stephen and getting his first command, and go on with no particular overriding plot, though there are several arcs carried through multiple books.

Surprise</em>, to acclimate themselves to the relatively laborious, jargon-laden prose style with a more action-y plot before they attempt to read the two earlier volumes. Even <em>experienced</em> readers are advised to acquire a copy of Dean King's <em>Sea of Words</em>, the 500+ page handbook and lexicon companion to the series.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0861l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0861l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0861l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Reading on a Kindle (or similar device) can also be very helpful; it saves a lot of time to be able to hold your finger down on, say, "solomongundy", and see a definition. Paper books don't have this feature yet.</span> King's <em>Harbors and High Seas</em> can also be useful to the reader, as it includes all the necessary maps to keep track of where events happened during the series, as well as the state of the world at the time. It is important to note that it is entirely possible to read the series without these aids; they are useful, but as one of the two main characters' jobs in the series is to have the essential naval matters explained to him, even if the reader does not know exactly what a "waister" is, the action of the book will still make sense.</p><p><em>Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men, and Organization, 1793-1815</em> by Brian Lavery is also an excellent companion to the series, but rather pricey. And for the culinary-minded, there's <em>Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels</em> by Anne Chotzinoff Grossman and Lisa Grossman Thomas.</p><p>A newer online companion, currently in progress, is the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cannonade.net/index.php">Patrick O'Brian Mapping Project<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which uses Google Maps to trace, with surprising accuracy, the various comings and goings of both Aubrey and Maturin; it is about halfway done at last count, and progressing quite nicely.</p><p>Compare with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em>, the final novel of which was published in 1967, two years before <em>Master and Commander</em> was published.

The midshipmen in particular, as they usually come to him as 11-14 year old children, and he takes a personal hand in their educations and moral well-being. He also has his foremast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> in his bargemen, common seamen who follow him from ship to ship and are the ones protecting his back when he leads a boarding action.<ul><li> Part of the reason Jack always feels terrible after a battle is that he has to write letters home explaining which of his friends died and how.</li><li> Jack&#146;s success as a captain is in large part, due to his ability to attract snd retain good men.

And when Maturin's supply of <em>that</em> drug is accidentally consumed by the ship's rats (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>), Maturin takes to smoking cigars much more frequently.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Ship</a>:<ul><li> "The horrible old <em>Leopard</em>."

Her sailing qualities are unremarkable, but what distinguishes her is that she nearly falls apart in a heavy sea and has to abandon pursuit of a fleet-action, returning to Malta yard wrapped up like a chrysalis in a cocoon of twelve-inch line to prevent her from disintegrating.

He offered Dundas a brass "chaser" cannon in exchange for one of his sailors whose name was Blew. (Dundas declined, sharing with Aubrey a dislike for "costumed" bargemen.

O'Brian somehow manages to squeeze what would properly be at least five, perhaps even ten years' worth of action into a period of less than 6 months, roughly spanning June 1813 (the end of <em>The Fortune of War</em>) to November 1813 (the beginning of <em>The Commodore</em>). Time resumes its normal sequence with <em>The Yellow Admiral</em>; the last completed book in the series, ''Blue at the Mizzen", presumably ends in early 1816. O'Brian even admitted this, saying it only made sense if you pretended there were "hypothetical years [...]. An 1812a, as it were, or even an 1812b."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">Companion Cube</a>: Jack's violin.

The <em>Surprise</em> in most of the series. The <em>Polychrest</em> was probably intended to be this by her architect, but ends up useless and bizarre. Jack, being made of awesome, nevertheless manages to get some good use out of her.<ul><li> Also slightly subverted in book one, as the <em>Sophie</em> is very much the Age of Sail equivalent of a rustbucket. She's called a ship-sloop, a three-masted unrated ship, but is actually a brig, which is two-masted. (Yay for Royal Navy social promotion &mdash; a brig is only a lieutenant's command, so any ship given to a commander automatically becomes a sloop, regardless of what it actually is.) Worse, she's dead slow, under-sailed, under-manned and under-gunned. Through clever naval and (ahem) social engineering, Aubrey manages to turn her into a top-notch commerce raider anyway. Jack's biggest concern with the <em>Sophie</em> is the undersized 4-pounders that make up her broadside. Unfortunately those are all the ship can bear. He once tried to mount a nine-pounder bow-chaser cannon, but the ship's carpenter stopped Jack from a second test shot because the stress it put on the knees threatened to rip the ship apart.<ul><li> Even the <em>Surprise</em> is outdated and undergunned compared to Frigates of the time (being 28-gun at a time when new Frigates had 36 or 38 guns, and 44-gun Frigates were starting to appear), but does have the advantage of being fast, especially into the wind. Even when built, the French classed her as a Corvette (a type of fast, light Frigate), though she actually carried more guns than was the norm for a corvette, her class of ship bridging a gap between smaller warships and frigates.</li><li> And the <em>Surprise</em> would have been even more outclassed if she hadn't been heavily rebuilt quietly off-page somewhere. The real <em>Surprise</em> (credited with the same recapture of the <em>Hermione</em>) originally carried 24 8pdr long guns and eight 4pdr on the quarter deck and forecastle as the <em>Unit&eacute;</em> in French service. When refitted and commissioned in the Royal Navy, she was reequipped with 24 32pdr carronades on her main deck and a further eight on the forecastle and quarter deck, plus long range chasers, quite heavy for a ship of her size, which complicated her rating (she was rated as a 28 gun sixth rate at first, then as a 32 gun fifth rate from 1797-98, then a sixth rate for the rest of her commission). Her mainmast was replaced with that of a 36 gun frigate, just as unusual as her heavy armament. <br>It is mentioned that <em>Surprise</em> had to be reinforced structurally at several points, and that her timbers could not stand a simultaneous broadside of all her guns. By <em>Blue at the Mizzen</em>, <em>Surprise</em> comes in for a near-total rebuild, including newly-designed diagonal bracings&mdash;presumably so she could better stand the recoil of her own guns, among other factors.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt Politician</a>: Politicians don't feature too commonly, but corruption <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">was the norm</a> for the day.

He is a friend of the sister of the famous British astronomer William Herschel; the sister tutored him in the art of building telescopes, and Aubrey constructs his own observatory (which we first see in <em>The Mauritius Command</em> and later in <em>The Commodore</em>). Jack is a friend and correspondent of Alexander Humboldt, and in the novel arc from <em>The Thirteen-Gun Salute</em> through <em>The Wine-Dark Sea</em>, is described taking extensive measurements of air and sea conditions in various regions on behalf of the latter, having been provided with a complete set of state-of-the art instruments for the purpose. In the last completed book of the series, <em>Blue at the Mizzen</em>, Jack and Stephen are seen convivially fraternizing with the members of a Royal Society expedition.</li><li> Again in <em>Blue at the Mizzen</em>, this trope is seen when Jack and Stephen examine the illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence (eventually to become William IV) to determine his fitness to ship aboard the <em>Surprise</em>. The examination is very much a tag team affair, as Jack quizzes the lad on astronomy, mathematics and navigation, while Stephen tests his knowledge of language and other liberal arts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Notwithstanding Jack's initial concerns that an aristocrat might be a spoiled brat ill-prepared for life at sea, young Horatio Hanson turns out to be an outstanding officer who saves Jack's life at one point.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>: Stephen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">illegitimate</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">orphan</a>, fostered in the back of beyond, sent from uncaring relative to relative, spends time in several prisons in Spain and Portugal, a Catholic who goes to a Protestant university in his mid-teens, survives the Terror, flees to Ireland, survives the 1798 rebellion, loses Mona, loses Lord Edward Fitzgerald, becomes a fugitive, and ends up penniless.

In <em>Sophie</em> of 14 guns and 54 men, he closes beneath the guns of the 32-gun, 319-man <em>Cacafuego</em>, blasts her from point-blank range, and takes her; in <em>Surprise</em> of 28 guns, he slugs it out in heavy seas against Admiral Linois' 74-gun flagship, giving nearly as good as he gets until the convoy of Indiamen manages to swarm in close and force Linois to break off.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4at7z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4at7z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4at7z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The heavy seas were why <em>Surprise</em> managed to survive: engaging from leeward the big 74 could not open the ports of its lowest gundeck, which housed her heaviest guns. It was touch-and-go, however, and <em>Surprise</em> was within one broadside of being sent to the bottom before the East Indiamen arrived and threatened to overwhelm Linois through weight of numbers.</span> And in <em>Leopard</em>, of 50 guns and extremely dubious repute (whereas both <em>Sophie</em> and <em>Surprise</em> were quick and nimble), he manages to sink a Dutch 74, though that came down to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">single lucky shot</a> in a very heavy storm: the first ship to lose control would broach-to and be swamped, and <em>Leopard</em> managed to snap <em>Waakzeimheid</em>'s foremast with a shot from her stern chaser.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByMaterialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByMaterialism">Death by Materialism</a>:<ul><li> French agent Duhamel, after helping Maturin and the British and being given passage to Qu&eacute;bec for his troubles, dies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> fashion.

The heroes are generally quite acceptable to modern readers, Stephen being incredibly progressive and Jack being too good-natured to really believe anything hurtful, but xenophobia, sexism, and classism still pervade the setting, just as it did in the real 19th-century world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">Politically Correct History</a> is <em>not</em> in effect.<ul><li> Not that Jack didn't have his moments, especially early in the series. He openly disdains the Irish, makes some ugly remarks about Catholics and comments on how Spaniards are innately cruel, sometimes right in half-Catalan, half-Irish Catholic Stephen's face (though he is usually quite quick to apologize, and gets better the more he interacts with Stephen). In the beginning of the series, he is mildly leaning towards being pro-slavery, albeit only because he considers abolition a threat to Britain's ability to fund the war (he has absolutely no qualms about race, and after he gets to see the conditions on a slaving ship first-hand he becomes a committed abolitionist). He makes several disparaging remarks about the American political system and considers "one man, one vote" to be the equivalent of anarchy, while defending the property-based British parliamentary system. He is less happy about flogging his men than many other captains, but completely ruthless in applying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">A Taste of the Lash</a> when he considers it to be necessary.</li><li> Jack clearly has no problem with coloured women. His early, temporary demotion for smuggling a woman aboard is implied, from context to have involved a coloured girl, and he has a mixed-race son by one such relationship.</li><li> Stephen was also remarkably progressive for the time, but he was also a 19th-century Catalan nobleman, and quite ready to protect his honor against any slights, real or imagined, by killing the offending party. He was also quite openly Islamophobic and hated "the Moors" (at the time, Muslim pirates and slavers were common in the Mediterranean and Stephen&#146;s part-Catalan background would also bear on this).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration">Destination Defenestration</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">alluded to</a> in Aubrey's dealings with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Kimber</a>'s lawyers.

The amounts of alcohol routinely consumed by the characters are astonishing by modern standards. Sometimes a character (e.g., frequently, Killick when ashore) will be referred to as drunk "even by naval standards."<ul><li> In this period, Royal Navy sailors were issued a twice-daily alcohol ration, usually grog (rum mixed in the ratio of half a pint to one quart of water, with citrus juice - typically lemon or lime - added originally to improve the taste of the water, later to prevent scurvy). The mixing and serving of the grog is a high point of the daily routine at sea, observed with great attentiveness and solemnity by the crew. The standard ratio of rum to water in grog is 1:4, and cutting the amount of rum in a sailor's grog is a standard punishment for minor offenses.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuetBonding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuetBonding">Duet Bonding</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">The Dung Ages</a>: Often upheld on land, but <em>strongly</em> subverted in anything having to do with the Royal Navy, especially the ships. Much is made of the Navy's fanatical attention to neatness and cleanliness, to the extent that there are several funny moments where Stephen hears his shipmates remark disapprovingly on the slovenly/filthy state of a certain ship, but himself can't see much of anything wrong. On a more serious note, Stephen remarks several times that the Navy's devotion to cleanliness translates into a significantly lower rate of infection and disease aboard ship than on shore. (Note that on the one occasion where a plague stalks the ship's&mdash;in this instance the <em>Leopard's</em> crew, in <em>Desolation Island</em>&mdash;the disease was brought aboard by a group of convicts that the <em>Leopard</em> was conveying to Botany Bay.)<ul><li> Jack keeps sailors as servants when ashore, which leads to his home being almost frighteningly clean, especially for a bachelor: it is perfectly natural behavior for the sailors to dismantle, mop, dry, and reassemble the house before breakfast every morning, and it gets a fresh coat of paint about once a week.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>:<ul><li> <em>Master and Commander</em> has no hint of Stephen's capacity for violence and only a tiny hint at his skills with intelligence, in fact rather than a key British agent, he's basically laying low after his involvement in the failed 1798 Irish Uprising.

However, a suspicious ship has just been spotted, so Jack decides (both for himself and his followers) to stay aboard the <em>Java</em> in the hope of sharing in the rewards of another prize. There's only one problem; that other ship is USS <em>Constitution</em>, the renowned "Old Ironsides", which proceeds to defeat and take the <em>Java</em> in a furious engagement.

Diana Villiers, Stephen's great love throughout most of the series, most frequently calls him "Maturin" before their marriage (and even occasionally after), and Stephen reciprocates by calling her "Villiers". In fact, Jack, Jack's wife Sophie, Diana, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later on in the series, Sir Joseph Blaine and Christine Wood</span> are the only people who are entitled, by the intimacy of their relationship, to address Stephen by his first name. (It should be emphasized that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a> does <em>not</em> imply coldness or distance in the relationship; for instance, Tom Pullings, who has been a close friend of Stephen's ever since their first commission together in the <em>Sophie</em>, invariably addresses him as "Doctor". Stephen, however, does customarily address Pullings as "Tom" in informal conversation. Stephen and Diana, during their long courtship, are another obvious example.)<ul><li> Jack's very old shipmates, especially those who follow him from commission to commission &mdash; his "followers" &mdash; invariably address him as "Captain" out of their deep respect for him, no matter how close their relationship is. Jack will customarily address old friends/subordinates such as Pullings, James Mowett, William Babbington (and later on in the series, William Reade) by their first name in informal conversation; when naval business is being done, he will call them "Mr. (insert surname here)" or address them by rank.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a> saves Stephen's fortune on at least one occasion: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Before leaving on his circumnavigation recounted in the arc beginning with <em>The Thirteen Gun Salute</em>, Stephen writes a power-of-attorney letter authorizing Sir Joseph Blaine to move his money from his current bank, which is providing highly unsatisfactory service, to a different one recommended by Jack. However, Stephen is writing a note to Diana at the same time, and in true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> fashion, signs that note with the formal "S. Maturin" signature that he uses for business letters and signs the power-of-attorney as "Stephen". This turns out to be very fortunate, however, as the bank Stephen had intended to shift his fortune to unexpectedly goes bust during the voyage, and because Sir Joseph can't move the funds with the incorrectly signed power-of-attorney, the money is safe in the "highly unsatisfactory" bank. Another happy result is that, from that point on, Stephen and Sir Joseph, already close friends, enjoy the liberty to address each other by unadorned first names.</span><ul><li> (In fact, anyone who has read collections of 19th century letters knows that people normally used a formal signature even when writing to their nearest and dearest.)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a><ul><li> There are numerous scenes, usually in passing, where Jack will read the Articles of War to the crew in lieu of a sermon on Sunday.<ul><li> The emphasis with which Jack reads these regulations, with their hair-curling repetition of "shall be punished by death", varies according to his mood and the situation on board ship. When all is well, he'll skim through the Articles so as to let the men get on with the important business of having their Sunday dinner; but when he's angry about something (as at the beginning of <em>The Truelove</em>), he'll read the Articles in a most impressively menacing fashion.</li></ul></li><li> Also discussed repeatedly in contexts such as when, early on in the series, Stephen quizzes one of the officers about the custom of showing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">false flags</a>" to trick a potential enemy. The officer explains that this practice is quite legal as tactical deception in pre-battle maneuvering, but that the ship's genuine national colors are <em>always</em> raised before battle is joined. This is quite important because if it's not done, the ship can legally be treated as a pirate vessel!</li><li> It causes a few problems sometimes: one character, Dutourd, in <em>The Wine-Dark Sea</em> takes it as an absolute affront that his possessions and money are claimed after it's been legally established that no, he had no letter of marque or anything similar - the closest thing he could produce was a well-wishing letter from the French Minister of Marine - and was thus being treated as a pirate, saying that he was robbed. He goes on to cause trouble for Stephen later.<ul><li> To be more precise, Dutourd's <em>personal</em> possessions and money were left alone (no doubt, of course, they would have been seized by the crews of privateers less well-disciplined than the <em>Surprise's</em> man-of-war's men); it was the expedition's treasury that was confiscated and then shared out among the crew. Also, his situation was more anomalous than the previous paragraph might imply. He himself didn't have the requisite letter of marque, but his American sailing-master, who was killed in the action in which the <em>Surprise</em> captured the <em>Franklin</em>, did, so Jack decided to stretch a point. As things turned out, that might not have been the wisest thing to do.</li></ul></li><li> The status of the <em>Surprise</em> herself, during the great circumnavigation that takes up much of the second half of the series, is worth looking at in some more detail. As of <em>The Reverse of the Medal</em>, the ship (which, for all its manifold virtues, is nonetheless obsolete by the technical standards of the day) has been taken out of service and put up for auction. When Jack is framed for stock market fraud, stripped of his rank and stricken from the list, Stephen (with the help of Tom Pullings) buys the <em>Surprise</em>, obtains "letters of marque" - documents issued by the British Government which authorize Stephen, as owner of the ship, to carry out military operations against Britain's enemies - has the ship moved to Shelmerston (where top-notch sailors and naval stores are readily to be found), and hires Jack as the <em>Surprise's</em> captain, making it clear all along that he is essentially holding the ship in trust until Jack - whom everyone acknowledges to be the rightful owner of the ship - can acquire enough wherewithal to purchase it again from Stephen. At this point, and going on until early into <em>The Thirteen-Gun Salute</em>, the <em>Surprise</em> is operating as a classic privateer, though Jack, being sensitive about the term (which has fallen into more than a little disrepute by the time of the Napoleonic Wars), prefers to refer to her as a private man-of-war. When Jack is cleared and reinstated in <em>The Thirteen-Gun Salute</em> and given command of the <em>Diane</em>, the <em>Surprise</em> takes on a new status, as HMHV (His Majesty's Hired Vessel) <em>Surprise</em>, and sails eastward, under the command of Tom Pullings, to rendezvous with the <em>Diane</em> once Jack has completed his mission. As it happens, the <em>Diane</em> is shipwrecked in a typhoon at the end of <em>The Thirteen-Gun Salute</em>, and Jack manages to obtain another ship in Batavia, which he names <em>The Nutmeg of Consolation</em>, or <em>Nutmeg</em> for short, and it is in this ship that he finally rendezvouses with <em>Surprise</em>. He transfers to <em>Surprise</em> and takes command again, with Pullings as his first officer, and from then on, the <em>Surprise</em>, though continuing to be a private vessel (Jack, who by this time is flush with cash from all the prizes he's captured, has bought her back again from Stephen at cost), operates, for all intents and purposes, as a Royal Navy vessel, under Admiralty orders, until her return to Great Britain.</li><li> The citizenship of sailors is also addressed in <em>Desolation Island</em>. In particular, US citizens Michael Herapath and Louisa Wogan are "encouraged" by Maturin to escape to an American whaler, because once they set foot on a US vessel, they could not be pursued for any crime. The crew of the American whaler, while Maturin is treating them for scurvy in exchange for the use of their forge, is revealed to be at least 1/3 British citizens and Royal Navy deserters. Aubrey <em>would</em> have been well within his rights and the law to press the British crewmen, or hang them for desertion, with no legal recourse for either the whaler's captain or the US. However, Maturin "neglects" to tell Aubrey.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieBackAndThinkOfEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieBackAndThinkOfEngland">Lie Back and Think of England</a>: Sophie may have been brought up to follow this trope, despite Jack's best efforts to encourage her to enjoy their marital relations.

During <em>The Yellow Admiral</em>, when their marriage is experiencing serious difficulties, Diana and Clarissa Oakes do their best to coax Sophie out of her indifference about sexual relations, with some success.<ul><li> It does not help that Jack's idea of foreplay is getting drunk at dinner and he approaches sex with the same briskly aggressive attitude he otherwise reserves for <em>boarding actions in combat</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>: Stephen and Sophie have this dynamic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAdvancementOpportunities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAdvancementOpportunities">Limited Advancement Opportunities</a>: Often averted since promotion is a plot point in nearly every book, and provides the title for five of the novels, but by the end of the series O'Brian had to go to increasingly absurd lengths to keep that much seniority in a small frigate like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">HMS Surprise</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Living Legend</a>: Captain Jack Aubrey, globe-trotting badass much caressed by the Admiralty, astronomer and geometer, member of the Royal Society.

Of course, they keep up the house as if it were a Royal Navy man-o'-war, which means dusting, sweeping and mopping the entire house before breakfast every day, routine daily inspections and maintenance, two weekly baths for everyone, and a fresh coat of paint once a week.

During his lecture at the Institut de France, on the subject of the Rodrigues solitaire, one of his listeners whispers to his neighbor that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">"If this man has anything to do with intelligence work, then I am the Pope."</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfGenreExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfGenreExperience">Out-of-Genre Experience</a>: The books are Napoleonic-era historical novels, but chapters here and there turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyDrama">espionage drama</a>. <em>The Reverse of the Medal</em> takes place almost entirely on land, centering as it does around political intrigues to oust Jack from the Navy and the desperate struggle to pinpoint <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>.<ul><li> Or period romance fit to compete with the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">Overly Narrow Superlative</a>: Jack defends his old ship, the aged, decrepit fifty-gun <em>H.M.S.

His equally amazing misfortunes on land often mean that at the start of every new book, his fortune is either lost or is in danger of being lost, with him hunting for a source of revenue that would clear his debts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse">Pintsized Powerhouse</a>: Midshipman (later lieutenant, later captain) Babbington. It's implied that his love of the ladies gave him the pox so often it stunted his growth. In fact, he never grew into the clothes his mother sent him to sea with in the first book and he's always been small.

They show up in <em>HMS Surprise</em>, when Jack leads a boarding-party of them to take a gunboat. Instead of charging in with cheers, European-style, the former pirates take out their targets with garrotes and knives in total silence, leaving Jack and the European sailors stunned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then comes the Port Mahon raid to free Stephen, where the capability for stealth and silent killing becomes paramount, and Jack makes a specific point of asking for them.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyMiddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyMiddie">Plucky Middie</a>: Lots and lots of them. Pullings, Babbington, and Mowett form the first generation of Jack's midshipmen, risen to commanders and post-captains themselves. Reade and Hanson belong to the "second generation"; by the end of the book series, Reade is a lieutenant in charge of the tender <em>Ringle</em>, while Hanson is on track for promotion to Lieutenant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">Potty Emergency</a>: Normally, arrival at a secret prison run by one of the dreaded intelligence agencies is an imposing affair, which makes things all the funnier in <em>The Surgeon's Mate</em> when&mdash;as a result of having eaten some rather dubious crayfish&mdash;Jack, Jagiello, and their captor, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional">Consummate Professional</a> Duhamel, all make a mad dash through the prison in search of a restroom upon arrival.

Stephen Maturin's own such moment also comes during his first adventure with Jack, when he successfully trepans a crew member to repair a brain injury; his naval friends, colleagues and crewmates cite this ever after as <em>prima facie</em> evidence of his sheer awesomeness in the field of medicine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a>: The series offers various iterations of this, particularly involving the British-American War of 1812 - sailing ships may have been at sea for months, and not be aware of current events; this can be further complicated by two ships having different sailing dates, and hence different notions of the situation. Averted, in that this is a well-known problem and sometimes results in awkward stand-offs while the situation is resolved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a> : Natural philosophers of the age embraced this trope, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a> Dr. Maturin especially does so.

Midway through the series, he is shown pouring alcohol onto a patient's skin before surgery, explaining that the sudden coldness of its evaporation numbs the patient and lessens the pain. Since this was decades before the widespread acceptance of germ theory, Stephen could not have known that he was disinfecting his patients and lessening the chance of post-surgery infection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>:<ul><li> Stephen Maturin's signature ability to fall out of any boat or ship. Eventually he gets better at this, but by that time it's too late: due to his reputation for such he is usually assisted aboard, much to his indignation. (On the other hand the officers have learned to cope; for a while it was standard practice to have a jar of oil ready&mdash;just in case Stephen's pocketwatch gets a dunking when he's trying to board, and needs to be cleaned of water.)</li><li> Conversely, the sailors are usually much more used to small craft than they are to horse-drawn carriages. Several minor incidents ensue.</li><li> Young Midshipman Babbington's obsession with prostitutes. On one visit to Plymouth, Aubrey had to empty his pockets beforehand as the only way of keeping him "passably chaste"; on other occasions he's usually the first to the sickbay after shore leave due to VD, and in his later appearances his growth appears to have been permanently stunted due to pox. (Not that it stops him from being an excellent lieutenant.)<ul><li> An associated one is Jack's constant need to vouch for that Babbington lost his nose in honourable action and not to syphilis.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>: Horner the gunner, over the first two-thirds or so of <em>The Far Side of the World</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedOrders">Sealed Orders</a>: Make an appearance in <em>The Commodore.</em> O'Brian even goes into detail about how they come with lead and are to be thrown overboard if the ship is taken.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretWeapon">Secret Weapon</a>:<ul><li> <em>Polychrest</em> was originally designed to carry one &mdash; a large rocket delivery system. Unfortunately, once it killed its inventor, the Navy was left with a ship that wasn't going to be firing off giant rockets... and wasn't much good for anything else, unless you count sailing backwards.</li><li> The French were convinced that <em>Worcester</em> carried one due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorFire">amazing technicolor muzzle flashes</a>, and ran like hell after the first broadside.

Another character makes a horse-driven round trip from Boston to Salem in a mere two hours.<ul><li> Also the aforementioned problem of the "marthambles", though in that case it was more a question of O'Brian not going deep enough into the contemporary materials.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">Shut Up, Hannibal!</a>: When Stephen <em>finally</em> has enough of Mrs. Williams' badgering of Jack Aubrey and his family, he coldly informs her that unless she stops he will inform the authorities about her illegal gambling racket.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat">Slashed Throat</a>: How Stephen deals with a French intelligence agent during a particularly harrowing day.

The crews of the ships he serves on often brag that their ship has a real physician that speaks Latin and Greek.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome">Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome</a>: Even accounting for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenInTime">Frozen in Time</a> aspect of the series, the child characters age more rapidly than one would expect.

Deadly, deadly paperwork.

He weighs about 18 stone (~250 pounds), and Dr. Maturin often frets about his weight and tries to get him to eat less. But he's still fit enough to lead his crew into hand-to-hand battles and scramble up the ship's ropes like an ape. If you have ever tried to climb up a sailing ship's rigging, you will grasp that he is, even by modern standards, quite physically fit.<ul><li> Jack is quite tall (his exact height isn't recorded, but is probably at least 6 feet, in a period where most men were under that; Napoleon is always depicted as being short but was probably actually of average or slightly less-than-average height for the time). His 18 stone probably doesn't hang on him in such an unseemly manner as might be supposed by modern readers.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellCrowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellCrowe">Russell Crowe</a> had to put on some weight for the movie, but he's not portly.

A fair rule of thumb is that once Aubrey makes it back to Britain, an arc has ended and another will begin soon. For instance:<ul><li> <em>Desolation Island</em> to <em>The Surgeon's Mate</em> has Aubrey and Maturin getting caught up in the War of 1812, being captured by and then escaping the Americans (and dealing with French intelligence services along the way).</li><li> <em>The Ionian Mission</em> and <em>Treason's Harbour</em> deal with Jack Aubrey's return to the Mediterranean and his various diplomatic endeavours there.

A captain gets a certain number of guns, an admiral a certain number more. After a particularly well fought battle in the first book, a number of ships fire off their guns as a salute to the <em>HMS Sophie</em> and her crew.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">Ugly Guy, Hot Wife</a>:<ul><li> Stephen is short (one source gives his height as 5'6"), dark, variously described as "scrawny" or "squat", pale, sloppily dressed (he has an unfortunate habit of smearing ink or grease on such nice items of clothing as he is able to obtain), his only remarkable feature being his pale eyes. Nonetheless, after many trials, he's able to win the hand of the dazzling beauty Diana Villiers.</li><li> Jack is big, strongly built (and rather stout, though probably not obese by modern standards), ruddy, blond, with twinkling blue eyes, and <strong>absolutely</strong> covered with scars from numerous battles, including a mostly-missing right ear. He's a good deal better-looking than his friend Stephen, but he's no Adonis either. <em>His</em> wife is the lovely blonde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnglishRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnglishRose">English Rose</a> Sophie Williams.<ul><li> Once pointed out by a female prisoner, who happens to see him swimming naked.

Meaning that anything officers discuss today will be hazily retold by the crew tomorrow.</li><li> Usually O'Brian gives both reliable and unreliable versions of events to contrast them, but occasionally only the crew's version will be told, leaving the reader guessing as to what actually happened.<ul><li> In <em>The Commodore</em>, Preserved Killick, Jack's steward, tells Barret Bonden, the Captain's coxswain, about domestic unrest in the Aubrey household. This is in fact something of an aversion of the trope, as Killick, who has served under the Captain since the beginning of the series, is as well-acquainted as anyone else alive with what makes his master tick; and he's talking to another very old shipmate and friend, Bonden, who knows Jack just as well as Killick does.</li></ul></li><li> Jack himself is an unreliable narrator to his wife, deliberately describing naval actions as loud, exciting, and generally bloodless as opposed to the harrowing and gruesome events they are. A classic example is describing a boarding action, in which impressed former pirates take an enemy vessel and systematically kill everyone on board, then calmly loot the bodies while the decks run with blood, with a 'we carried the day'.</li><li> In <em>The Truelove</em>, a red silk wedding dress is striking and symbolic of trouble to the reader, while being unremarkable to the characters, since white wedding dresses were uncommon at best at the time &mdash; a wedding dress would just be the nicest dress the lady owned or could afford, regardless of color. White wedding dresses did not become standard issue for brides in the Western world until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">The Victorian Era</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">What a Piece of Junk</a>: <em>HMS Sophie</em> in the first book. She's actually a brig (a two-masted coastal patrol vessel), but officially listed as a three-masted frigate due to social promotion &mdash; brigs were considered lieutenants' commands, so rather than demote the commander, the Navy promoted the ship. That becomes a problem when she's expected to handle the duties of a vessel of her rating. She's old, leaky, slow before the wind, slower in turning, has a pittance of a broadside and even less chase armament, and her crew is both woefully understrength and composed of an equal mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">total lubbers, press-ganged felons and near-senile old salts.</a> Through a mix of clever naval engineering and just-as-clever social engineering, Aubrey manages to turn her into an absolutely deadly commerce raider anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: O'Brian uses a number of fictitious places in the course of the series, with varying degrees of geographical specificity. The semi-piratical English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWestCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWestCountry">West Country</a> port of Shelmerston and the fictional Polynesian island of Moahu are two particularly noteworthy examples.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>: A particularly pure version of this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: Many, <em>many</em> examples throughout the series, from <em>Master and Commander</em> onwards. Jack, for instance, is in the habit of having a defeated enemy captain keep his sword (which the vanquished is traditionally supposed to give to the victor as token of surrender) if his antagonist has fought with particular gallantry.<ul><li> Jack and his officers will sometimes correct others if those people make slighting remarks about the opposition; for instance, in <em>H.M.S. Surprise</em>, a passenger aboard the <em>Surprise</em> speculates that the French must be acting in a cowardly fashion during a certain sea battle. Jack (or one of his officers) quickly demurs, praising the French for their gallantry and pointing out that the French commander is actually waiting to gain a tactical advantage.</li><li> In <em>The Nutmeg of Consolation</em>, Jack is displeased when Stephen tells him that he's arranged to have the gunpowder resupply of a French frigate (which Jack very much desires to engage and, if possible, capture) cut off. This is because Jack feels that it wouldn't be a fair fight to take on a ship that can't shoot back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, the Frenchmen encounter a Dutch merchantman and confiscate her store of gunpowder, thus ensuring that they'll have enough for the battle.</span></li><li> In <em>The Surgeon's Mate</em>, the American commander Lawrence of the U.S.S. <em>Chesapeake</em>, mortally wounded in battle with the H.M.S. <em>Shannon</em> at the end of <em>The Fortune of War</em>, is buried in Halifax with full military honors, the funeral being attended by every senior British naval officer on hand including Jack (who is still recovering from serious wounds sustained in the destruction of H.M.S. <em>Java</em> by the <em>Constitution</em> in the previous book).</li><li> And as for <em>The Fortune of War</em>, the climactic ship-to-ship battle between the <em>Shannon</em> and <em>Chesapeake</em> is organized in a punctiliously formal way that shows beyond a doubt that both captains regard each other as worthy opponents.</li><li> Throughout the entire series, there are many, many incidents which show a strong feeling of professional kinship among the men who sail the seas and serve their respective countries in their navies. This is closely related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a> (see entry above); there is a strong sense of what is "done" and "not done" in naval warfare and an equally strong code of honor and respect between professional naval officers, which becomes a plot point on more than a few occasions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Yank the Dog's Chain</a>: If everything's going well by the end of one book, expect it to have changed by the start of the next.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontWantToCatchThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontWantToCatchThis">You Don't Want to Catch This</a>: Maturin uses the plague this way in the first book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Your Approval Fills Me with Shame</a>: Alluded to in <em>The Letter of Marque</em>, after Jack is framed for stock fraud. Mrs. Williams doesn't think for a moment that he's innocent, but she thoroughly approves of what she thinks he did (i.e., defraud the stock market of potentially thousands of pounds).</li></ul><hr>
