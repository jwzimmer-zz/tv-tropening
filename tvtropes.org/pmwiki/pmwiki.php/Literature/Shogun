The novels don't form a single continuous story, but are linked together by recurring characters, and their descendants, and a theme of examining interactions between Asian peoples and Westerners.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The novels, in chronological order, are:</p><ul><li> 1600, Japan: <em>Shogun</em> (1975)</li><li> 1841, Hong Kong: <em>Tai-Pan</em> (1966)</li><li> 1862, Japan: <em>Gai-Jin</em> (1993)</li><li> 1945, Singapore: <em>King Rat</em> (1962)</li><li> 1963, Hong Kong: <em>Noble House</em> (1981)</li><li> 1979, Iran: <em>Whirlwind</em> (1986)</li></ul><p><em>Shogun</em>, <em>Tai-Pan</em>, <em>King Rat</em> and <em>Noble House</em> have been adapted for film and television (with the <em>Shogun</em> miniseries/film starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiroMifune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiroMifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> being the best known adaptation), and <em>Shogun</em> was also adapted as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom">Infocom</a> computer game and a Broadway musical.

The most notable excision is that Struan's meeting with Jin-Qua completely excises the plot point of the four half-coins so crucial to the novels.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Despite being six hours, the 1988 Noble House miniseries has a lot of things missing compared to the book, most notably the Sevrin plot and everything to do with it (including Jacques' status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, Cross' double agent status and Suslev's character). Other excised elements include the visit of a delegation of British MPs, the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> Peter Marlowe, Dunross' dealings with the Japanese Toda family and anything to do with Dunross' own family.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalIntelligence">Adaptational Intelligence</a>: In <em>Noble House</em> Linc Bartlett never figures out that Gornt put Orlanda up to seducing him, although he does have his suspicions. In the miniseries he puzzles it out in the third episode and gets her to confess - not that it matters, because he's genuinely in love with her by that point.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>:<ul><li> The 1988 <em>Noble House</em> miniseries had a few examples.<ul><li> Linc Bartlett. In the book he's popular with everyone due to his immense charm and charisma, business savvy and personal bravery. In the miniseries he's a lot less scrupulous, and his deal with Gornt seems to be partially motivated by jealousy over Casey's attraction to Dunross.</li><li> Also Gornt: while played with great charisma by John-Rhys Davies, he's a lot more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Faux Affably Evil</a> here. Most notably, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">"prank"</a> towards Casey on the boat is NOT laughed off by either of them.</li></ul></li><li> In the 1986 <em>Tai-Pan</em> film Brock is much more of a straightforward villain, lacking his book counterpart's depth and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">code of conduct</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>:<ul><li> Edward Gornt, who founded the Gornt company, is a big character in <em>Gai-Jin</em>; while he isn't exactly evil, he wastes no time in trying to get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Malcolm Struan's widow Angelique</span> to jump in bed with him. Even though he founds the company which becomes the Noble House's enemy, you can't help but like him, if for no other reason than he has balls.</li><li> Quillian Gornt, his descendant from <em>Noble House</em>, is a primary antagonist, and yet somewhat charming in his own way - he's a son of a bitch, but he also has quite a way with women. In fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after he drowns (between <em>Noble House</em> and <em>Whirlwind</em>), Ian Dunross retires from being Tai-Pan of the Noble House because life is just too boring without his archrival there to compete with</span>. In the miniseries, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dunross asks why he shouldn't just let Gornt be financially ruined by Struan's new share prices, an exasperated Gornt replies that life would be dull for Dunross without him. Tellingly, it works.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>:<ul><li> Robb Struan was this before the main plot of <em>Tai-Pan</em> gets under way. A mightily-angry Dirk solves him by giving him a pistol and telling him to either clean up or shoot himself.</li><li> His nephew Culum is revealed to have become a particularly sad case of this in <em>Gai-Jin</em> - having taken over as Tai-Pan after Dirk's death he's nowhere near as competent or strong-willed at it as Dirk was, and the stress cripples him. Coupled with a loveless marriage to the future Hag Struan (who repeatedly unfavourably compares him to Dirk), he turns to alcohol to cope. It ends up killing him not long into <em>Gai-Jin</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticOffspring">Antagonistic Offspring</a>:<ul><li> Dirk manufactures a falling out between him and Culum in <em>Tai-Pan</em> in order to give the impression Culum is this to his enemies so he can catch them off guard. Unfortunately, as Culum finds out more and more what his dad's really like it becomes increasingly real.</li><li> Played completely straight with Tess Brock after she elopes with Culum Struan and gets cast out by her father Tyler. <em>Gai-jin</em> and <em>Noble House</em> detail how she's eventually the one most responsible for destroying all his businesses and ruining him later in life.</li><li> Invoked by Hakim and Azadeh Khan's half-sister to get Hakim exiled by his father Abdollah Khan in the backstory of <em>Whirlwind</em>, although it's groundless and merely a way for her to increase her own power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Played straight when it's revealed Hakim really had been trying to have the Khan murdered before that point, including sending the assassins Erikki kills.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Clavell's heroes tend to zigzag this trope: Blackthorne and Ian Dunross are the closest to traditional heroes, but Dirk Struan is <em>very</em> much this: ruthless, manipulative of his family, utterly merciless to his enemies - he actually shows <strong>less</strong> standards than Tyler Brock (the main villain of <em>Tai-Pan</em>) when he uses Tyler's own daughter against him to kill his mad son. In <em>Shogun</em> Toranaga is so far into this trope he's practically an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>:<ul><li> When Blackthorne was horrified and enraged by a Dutch shipmate being boiled alive, no one bothered to tell him that it had been a legal death sentence back home in Tudor England for over 50 years.</li><li> <em>Noble House</em> has various characters being worried that Delta Force is active in Vietnam and on the Iranian border in 1963. The real Delta Force wasn't actually founded until the 1970s.</li><li> In <em>Gai-Jin</em> there is an important plot point in the marksmanship of British sailors and Redcoats with modern centerfire rifles and metal cartridges and their introduction to Japanese Daimyos. As of 1862, the British service rifle was the caplock, paper-cartridge Pattern 1853 Enfield. The first British centerfire rifle, Snider-Enfield, did not appear until 1867, and even the early Snider-Enfield still fired paper-cartridges with metal base, similar to modern shotgun shells.</li><li> Also in <em>Gai-Jin</em>, the Emperor of Japan is repeatedly referred by both Japanese and Britons as "Emperor K&#333;mei". Emperors of Japan get their regnal names after their deaths, during lifetime he was called only "The Emperor" or by his titles.</li><li> Ishido's peasant-soldier background is always brought against him by everyone, from the highest Daimyo to the lowliest samurai. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IshidaMitsunari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IshidaMitsunari">Ishida Mitsunari</a> had been born samurai in a line of relatively-wealthy samurai warriors. This, however, may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a> with Ishida's master, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, who did rise from the lowest ranks.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>: In <em>Noble House</em>, Casey says this before giving a long and conspicuously encyclopedic description of Armenia and it's location, history and geopolitics to characters who do not, in fact, have any reason to know anything about Armenia. Dunross later uses this exact phrase when explaining a Chinese saying to Tiptop Toe - an actual Chinese who wouldn't need this explained.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>: Peter Marlowe in <em>King Rat</em> and <em>Noble House</em> is based on Clavell himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInCharge">Badass in Charge</a>: Another Clavell staple - Lord Toranaga, Dirk Struan, Tyler Brock, Ian Dunross and Quillan Gornt are all leaders of their clans/companies and all are unquestionably the toughest, smartest and most cunning man there. Notably, Dunross and Gornt served in the British armed forces in World War 2 in the backstory of <em>Noble House</em> (Dunross as a Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain, Gornt as an infantry captain fighting the Japanese).<ul><li> Zigzagged a little in regards to being Tai-pan of Struan's. While Dirk' s legacy makes it clear a Tai-pan should absolutely be this, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">manipulations of Hag Struan</a> and the poor decisions of his immediate predecessors mean that Dunross is probably the first Tai-pan since Dirk Struan himself to really be this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> During <em>Shogun</em>, Toranaga becomes the shogun, and all the power that such a title brings.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a>: <em>Shogun</em> features a double-reverse version: after a drunken party, Blackthorne is visited in the dark by a woman he assumes to be his interpreter Mariko. Next morning, he learns from Mariko that it was really one of the maids. However, we later learn that it <em>was</em> in fact Mariko, who took the place of the maid, but didn't want him to know about it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Benevolent Boss</a>: Dirk Struan of <em>Tai-Pan</em> knows all too well what conditions on ships are normally like, so he makes sure to pay wages on the day, in silver, and equips his ships with the best of everything. Sailors fight for the chance to work aboard one of his ships.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>: In <em>Shogun</em>, asking whether or implying that Toranaga wants the Shogunate for himself is the only thing that consistently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">gets an emotional reaction out of him</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">That being said...</a></span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">Big Bad Wannabe</a>:<ul><li> Yabu from <em>Shogun</em> believes he is smarter and more cunning than Toranaga and is constantly looking to manuever the latter's poor positionto his advantage. Needless to say, he's not and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Toranaga decrees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a> near the book's end and orders him to commit seppuku</span>.</li><li> Katsumata, the puppetmaster of the Sonno-joi movement and hugely respected samurai master in <em>Gai-Jin</em> regards himself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>, maneuvering the shishi in driving a wedge between the gai-jin and the Shogunate to pave the way for putting the Satsumas in power. However, he overreaches and makes the mistake of striking at Toranaga Yoshi via inserting a disciple in the entourage of his mistress Koiko, who then fails, leading to her death and that of Koiko. Yoshi has him captured, and he's reduced to begging fruitlessly for his life and offering to sell out others in the plot (which all who hear it regard as shameful). Yoshi eventually lets Koiko's Mama-San <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">cut his balls off</a> and slit his throat in retribution for his getting Koiko killed.</li><li> Suslev, the KGB operative in <em>Noble House</em> should be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> given how fear of Communism and the Sevrin plot permeates the book. Yet he keeps managing to make things worse for himself - his open admiration of Stalin causes the previously loyal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacques</span> to have severe second thoughts. Later, he betrays his Executive Officer to the Hong Kong police, but doesn't anticipate them taking him alive, which puts him in the impossible position of either having to give up Sevrin to escape their grasp or say nothing and have them let the Soviets know what he'd done (with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">inevitable KGB retribution</a> that implies).

Blackthorne and Mariko speak to each other in Latin when they don't want to be understood by Japanese or Portuguese speakers. Unfortunately, some enemy samurai are Catholic, and they also speak Latin. Blackthorne figures out who was eavesdropping by reciting a prayer and waiting for an "Amen".

Going as far as saying "Who cares about titles, power is what matters" to an envoy. They both know perfectly well that in Japan, titles, even when completely removed from any real decision-making, are still potentially very important. Eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when the Emperor is made to ask Toranaga to be his shogun, he "reluctantly accepts".</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>: Given the massive culture clashes prevalent in the novels, this is a theme. While the actions of the Chinese, Japanese and later Iranians are totally within the framework of their own cultures and religions, they appear this way to bewildered Western onlookers like Blackthorne or Casey and Bartlett, so alien are they to the Western values of the time (for example, witness Blackthorne's trouble understanding the samurai's right to kill peasants on as little a whim as testing their swords). While some, like Struan and Dunross, manage to gain an impressive understanding of Asian culture, it's never enough to get it fully.<ul><li> The Struan/Brock, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Dunross/Gornt</a> rivalries are special in this regard, as the blood feud between them means they often take actions utterly incomprehensible to outsiders, even other Westerners.

It's a recurring trait of various British characters in the saga to be as stiff and stuffy as possible, usually in <em>playful</em> manner when dealing with their non-British friends. Probably best exemplified by Marlowe during his first contact with King in <em>King Rat</em>. Despite being malnourished, half-starved and being served perfectly made eggs, he calls them "not bad" and then has to explain to the enraged King he meant it as the highest compliment, rather than an insult.<ul><li> Largely averted by Blackthorne, who was lower-class. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

If Toranaga submits, his plans are finished. If he refuses to submit (or fails to appear at all), the Council can declare that he is in rebellion against the Emperor, and will have the leverage to turn all of Japan against him.

The subversion is that he initially doesn't know a word of Japanese (not to speak of cultural misunderstandings), rendering him unable to fill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist">Cunning Linguist</a>'s role as an interpreter for his crew.

Trouble is, with events unfolding with Toranaga, Omi, Mariko and Yabu, he forgets all about it and it starts to rot and attract flies - a cardinal sin in Japan as it upsets the village's harmony. As Blackthorne has given orders no-one touch it bar him, one old gardener volunteers to dispose of it, knowing full well he must then commit seppuku for disobeying Blackthorne's instructions. Blackthorne is aghast and wracked with guilt and rage when he finds out, but Toranaga makes clear that not only was the old gardener in immense pain from arthritis and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">proud to serve Blackthorne to the point of death</a>, he even dispatched one of his own samurai <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodWayToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodWayToDie">to make the death as swift and honourable as possible</a>.</li><li> Later used to show the more malicious side of Toranaga: it is mentioned early in the book that a prophecy states Ishido will "die an old man with his feet firmly planted in the earth, the most famous man in the land".

In <em>Tai-Pan</em> one of the pirate Wu Fang Choi's conditions when presenting the half-coin is for a Clipper ship as in Struan's fleet - one which will be the terror of merchant shipping in the area. However, while Fang Choi specifies the build, crewing and delivery time involved, he doesn't specify what's to happen <strong>after</strong> the ship is delivered, which Struan realises in the novel and we later find out in <em>Noble House</em> his successor Culum acted on and sank the ship after delivery.

Initially he hides out in the foreign Yokohama settlement solely to avoid being caught by Shogunate samurai, learning Western ways to further his role as Tyrer's language teacher, but as he begins to understand them more fully he realises he has to learnt their ways as fully as possible, as the only way to ensure Japan's safety is to adopt Western technology and industry to establish themselves as a power in their own right.

While both sides do have a moral code they adhere to, Struan and Brock are willing to do near-anything to destroy the other and make very dubious moral decisions throughout.

The floor is covered in filth, the air is hot with a terrible stench and the men themselves only have enough room to stand in very close proximity, with those who lie down being too sick and near death to stand.

Malcolm Struan and Angelique Richard in <em>Gai-Jin</em> also have this dynamic even though they're both European, so the author seems to be fond of this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>:<ul><li> At one point in <em>Shogun</em> Mariko is staggered to discover that the Portuguese sailors of the ship she's on contemptuously refer to all Japanese as monkeys.

Toranaga is repeatedly stated to be a military genius and an amazing battle commander who has never lost a battle in his life, yet the reader never actually sees him leading in a battle, and the moments when we see him planning a campaign are very brief and not particularly detailed (possibly because the author was not an expert on samurai warfare strategies). However, because we get many, <em>many</em> examples of his brilliance in political chessmastery and manipulation, we don't really have any reason to doubt the people who say he's a great general, so he gets away with it better than most examples of this trope.

Of course, since he died two years before the protagonist came to the scene, the book depicts the daimyos taking political scheming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy">Villainous Legacy</a>: Admittedly depends how you see both characters, but...<ul><li> When he eventually wins out in <em>Shogun</em>, Toranaga establishes near total control over Japan, ensures all other Daimyo in Japan pay tribute and hostages to him and his family, that the position of Shogun is limited to his family, outlaws Christianity and cuts off Japan from all foreign contact. All of this sets the stage for <em>Gai-Jin</em> and the problems and unrest these acts have created in the long-term are what Yoshi has to maneuver around.</li><li> Dirk Struan creates an actual Legacy all future Tai-Pans have to abide by, which details the consolidation of power for the Struans and the total annihilation of the Brock family's descendants - even the ones that don't know they're Brock's descendants.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue">Villainous Rescue</a>: In <em>Whirlwind</em> Eriki Yokkonen and his wife Azadeh are saved from a furious mob by the KGB agent Rakoczy. Granted, it's so they can be used for his own ends later, but it still counts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction">We Need a Distraction</a>: In <em>Shogun</em> Toronaga is trying to sneak out of Osaka Castle and is in danger of being stopped by Ishido, Blackthorne does an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">Obfuscating Insanity</a> act, complete with manic dancing and wild shouts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternSamurai">Western Samurai</a>: From <em>Shogun</em>, there's John Blackthorne, an English pilot that survived the shipwreck of his ship on Japanese coasts and eventually captured, but eventually he became close to the Shogun Toranaga, gaining the title of samurai.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes">What Beautiful Eyes!</a>: Dirk is mentioned to have very striking, bright green eyes, to the point that the Chinese refer to him as the "green-eyed devil".

Dunross seems to have caught on by <em>Whirlwind</em>, where it's noted that he retired as tai-pan soon after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gornt drowned in a boating accident, as there just wasn't any excitement to things any more.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a>: Being good at this is definitely a hallmark of a Clavell protagonist - Toranaga from <em>Shogun</em>, Dirk Struan from <em>Tai-Pan</em>, Toranaga Yoshi and Edward Gornt from <em>Gai-Jin</em>, and Ian Dunross from <em>Noble House</em> are all shown to be able to navigate through umpteen unforeseen setbacks while keeping their goals firmly within reach. Those who aren't don't tend to have a good survival track record.<ul><li> Toranaga and Ishido are playing it against each other all the way through <em>Shogun</em>. Ishido seems to be better at it, as during much of the second half Toranaga mainly just goes through desperate attempts to buy more time and needs the help of several others to figure out how to counter Ishido's latest move. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But in the end it's enough...</span></li><li> Dirk's so good at it that in <em>Tai-Pan</em> Gordon Chen automatically assumes that May-May's proposed assassination of Gorth Brock is his idea, played out subtly and in secretive Chinese style. In reality Dirk has no idea about it, and May-May even notes he'd have her, his own mistress, arrested and hanged if he knew what she was doing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a>: Mariko Buntaro both subverts it (refuses her husband in private instead of being subservient to him) and plays it straight (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> preferring death rather than renouncing her ideals</span>).

Portuguese (and/or Japanese and Dutch, depending on the POV character) is rendered as contemporary English. When Blackthorne and Mariko slip into Latin, however, it's rendered as Ye Olde Butchered Englishe. "I say thou art beautiful, and I love thee!" It also occasionally crops up in translations of Farsi in <em>Whirlwind</em>, particularly during declarations of love.</li><li> In <em>Tai-Pan</em> the old English speech patterns of Brock and his family really stand out as old-fashioned compared to other characters. Culum is even shown to be teaching Tess more modern speech later in the book.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Lots of characters try this, with varying degrees of success.
