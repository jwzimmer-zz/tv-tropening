On the other end of the Empire, the Seven Cities subcontinent is gathering for a religiously mandated uprising known as the Whirlwind, and as the war unfolds, it becomes clear that the inexperienced noblewoman Laseen has inexplicably chosen to put down the rebellion is much more than she seemed at first sight, with unknown motivations and an unknown agenda she will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">stop at nothing</a> to realize.

There are gods and goddesses everywhere and for everything and whatever gets worshipped in a given place depends on the people living there. While the biggest suspects have temples in the most major cities, even individual desert tribes can have their own, real and kicking, deities. There are various kinds of deities in the malazanverse:<ul><li> The <em>Elder Gods</em> are rumored to be elemental forces that used to be worshipped in times gone by.

Gods, in the malazanverse, are bound to the limits that worship sets upon them.</li><li> <em>Ascendants</em> are beings that have in some way transcended the natural boundaries of their race and make for excellent god material.

It's never explained in detail what Alchemist Baruk does exactly to work his magic, but since he's called High Alchemist, he must be good at it.</li><li> Shamans, witches and warlocks who call on spirits and use intuitive, primitive magic also exist. These forms are rarely practised anymore outside of certain tribes but are a remnant of what the Warrens used to be before the Elder God K'rul formed them into the Warrens to make the access to magic easier and more egalitarian rather than the exclusive domain of Gods and Bonecasters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">Gaia's Vengeance</a>: Subverted - it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Poliel, goddess of Disease, who thinks that Burn would want that done in her name</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject">Gender Is No Object</a>: Most of the cultures are largely equal-opportunity when it comes to daily life and war, especially the dominant Malazan Empire which considers itself egalitarian in all aspects. Two noted exceptions are the Tiste Edur tribes where the women rule the house and the men are warriors, and the mercenary/holy order known as the Grey Swords, who are noted as unusual for not allowing women into their ranks. That also changes when they switch patron deities from the Boar of Summer to the Wolves of Winter and take in female recruits to supplement their torn ranks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a>: Plenty of characters are namechecked but never appear in the main story &mdash; the most prominent being Admiral Nok and High Fist Greymane.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip">Ghost Ship</a>: In the <em>Novels of the Malazan Empire</em>-book <em>Assail</em>, news of a massive gold find causes thousands of fortune seekers to sail for the mysterious continent of Assail. Many try to reach the gold fields by sailing through the Dread Sea, not realizing that the sea was produced when the glaciers of a magical ice age retreated north and it is still infused with enough magic to drive most people insane. Crew members feel a compulsion to jump overboard, and soon you have a lifeless ship drifting in the middle of a fog covered sea. Later arrivals discover these ghost ships and the ensuing dread and paranoia only drive them insane faster. By the end of the novel the sea has hundreds of ghost ships floating in it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">Giant Flyer</a>:<ul><li> The dragons of the series are immense.

The Shi'Gal are double that height again and Shi'Gal Gu'Rull grows wings in order to better be able to accomplish his mission in the last two books of the series.

A god who is not prayed to becomes gradually forgotten and eventually dies. Yet at the same time, accepting worship binds them to their followers, sometimes even distorting their nature and directing their actions against their own will.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>:<ul><li> The Imass came to a racial consensus that after the latest in a long string of Jaghut Tyrants, the Threshold had been crossed.

The only source of information on that is an undead dragon in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds">eighth book</a>, who claims that it happened and brought the Jaghut &mdash; usually a solitary bunch prone to becoming hermits &mdash; together in entire armies, as well as allies from almost every race in existence at that time. High King Kallor, who's old enough to have seen the Jaghut in their prime, has never heard of that war and refuses to believe the dragon. The trope is, however, later averted in the prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy">The Kharkanas Trilogy</a></em>, where it happens onscreen, but is still in play for the main series.</li><li> The civil war that sundered the Tiste home realm of Kurald Galain is often references but barely ever shown, and what little information there is tends to contradict itself. All that's certain is that it destroyed Kurald Galain and caused the three Tiste peoples to evacuate into other realms, and was caused by Mother Dark turning away from her children. Again, this one is averted in the prequel trilogy, but remains in play in the main series.</li><li> The extermination war in which the T'lan Imass decided they'd had enough of being ruled over by the Jaghut Tyrants and vowed to hunt the latter into extinction is also often referenced and important for the setting's backstory, but only bits and pieces of information are given to the reader. This one happened at least three hundred thousand years before the main story.</li><li> Another extermination war with even less information available is that of the Forkrul Assail against the followers of the god best known as the Errant. It reduced the Errant's power drastically and himself from the local top god to skulking the shadows. And that's pretty much all that is known about it. Other than that he is still smarting tens of thousands of years later.</li><li> The Forkrul Assail &mdash; they love their war mongering &mdash; invasion of the sub-continent of Kolanse is very sparsely explained, but being important to the series' backstory, it is referenced quite often once introduced. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They showed up in their ships, took over, caused a famine and have been lording over Kolanse ever since.</span> How exactly they managed to gain control over several kingdoms can only be inferred thanks to their particular style of magic.</li><li> The various conquests of the Malazan Empire are mostly only referenced, chiefly among them the conquest of the continents of Korelri and Genabackis (only the tail-end of which is shown) and the sub-continent of Seven Cities. The latter plays the bigger role in the backstory of the series as it provides the set-up for the Whirlwind Rebellion that happens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates">second volume</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a>: Very few villains are downright evil. Even the most heinous of antagonists do what they do with a thought-out reason. Conversely, the protagonists are not free from blame, either, for the most part. In a few books, the major conflict lacks a side with any kind of moral high ground, such as in the Malazans vs. Darujhistan conflict and the Letherii vs. Tiste Edur conflict.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler">Guttural Growler</a>: Count how many times "growled" or "grunted" is used as a dialogue tag.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a>: Sergeant Hellian is more or less continuously drunk but manages to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster">bizarrely competent soldier</a> and squad leader. She is clumsy and can't keep her two corporals apart, but leads her part of the Malazan invasion of the Empire of Lether from tavern to tavern, leaving behind severed heads and empty wine cellars.

In <em>Assail</em>, a character lampshades the fact that from the perspective of the common people, the Malazan Empire is no more corrupt than the old regimes and it offers the poor opportunities they never had before. The empire is mostly a meritocracy and thus a peasant from a backwater community like him can rise up in its ranks as far as his talent and luck will allow him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellhound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellhound">Hellhound</a>:<ul><li> The Hounds of Shadow and eventually the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hounds of Light</span> are said to be the size of ponies, and the former can travel between realms using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">shadow magic</a> as they are basically the pets of the King of High House Shadow.

Shadowthrone claims confidence in the Hounds' loyalty and guarding of his Shadow keep, but his right hand man Cotillion, the Patron God of Assassins, prefers to keep a weary eye on these 'pets'.</li><li> The Deragoth, or Hounds of Darkness, are supposed to be even bigger than the Hounds of Shadow and to resemble bears in size. They may be even older than the Hounds of Shadow, old enough, in fact, to once have domesticated early humans as <em>their</em> pets.

However, if one reads closely, one finds the girl acknowledging the presence of readers and even actively calling them cowards for wanting to skip her harrowing tale:<div class="indent"><em> 'Do not flee us.

She may have, depending on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> source, created light which brought justice, although the series makes the point that Father Light's justice is a harsh and unforgiving thing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Is Not Good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a> are out in full force in this series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>: Not thematically, but Erikson has announced that the Kharkanas Trilogy will have a slightly more traditional and less complex structure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Is Not Good</a>: The Tiste Liosan are the Children of Light, have light-themed powers and worship a deity known as Father Light.

A Matron could produce several kinds of breeds (workers, warriors, assassins, and so on) depending on the task they were needed for. Despite possessing their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">racial Warren</a>, the K'Chain Che'Malle also were able to manufacture what they called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">drones</a> and enable them to run certain programs even thousands of years after their makers had died, creating the effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">Magic from Technology</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DustOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DustOfDreams">Dust of Dreams</a></em> features the last remaining functioning hive city called Kalse Rooted and reigned over by the failing and mad Matron Gunth'an Acyl.

This goes on up to and including the final book. Additionally, the list of characters in each new book is more a representative sample of important names, and in no way exhaustive.

They also tend to have their own personalities when not part of a Storm, but run mostly on selfish instinct and whatever catches their fancy, which got quite a few Eleint imprisoned for being power hungry nuissances. Additionally, due to a complicated bargain the Elder God K'rul made with the Eleint, many of them embody one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Paths of Magic</a> accessible to humans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Soletaken Eleint</a> (not to be confused with Eleint Soletaken, which go the other way around) are members of other races who have gained the ability the shapeshift into a dragon, usually by killing a pure blooded one and drinking its blood, although the ability can be simply inherited. They are usually smaller dragons than the pure Eleint, but gain a tendency for blood lust even if they hadn't had it before, as evidenced with Silchas Ruin.</li><li> The Loqui Wyval and Enkar'al are the "mongrels of the dragons", whom nobody wants and who seem to not be sentient, but rather like unwanted, clingy pets to the other two kinds &mdash; the Loqui Wyval more so than the Enkar'al, who have gone native on the world of and are considered a delicacy in the Malazan Empire.

As of the time of the main series, most of the Elder Gods are no longer active owing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">their worship having been forgotten</a>, but a few are still around.</li><li> The second group is composed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">deities who were once mortal</a>; mortals can become Ascendants (superhuman immortals) through a process that is poorly-understood in-universe but typically involves proving oneself truly exceptional in some way, and Ascendants can in turn become gods by being worshipped and/or taking over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodJob">divine position</a> that was vacant at the time. And there are at least a couple of Ascendants, like Anomander Rake, who are worshipped but voluntarily choose not to claim full godhood. The majority of the modern pantheon are Ascendants.</li><li> Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Crippled God</a>, an interloper from another world who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">doesn't follow the usual rules</a> and makes quite a lot of trouble as a result.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent">Our Mages Are Different</a>:<ul><li> The ability to use magic occurs at random in all races and social classes and usually manifests in some way &mdash; if the mage hasn't been formally taught it develops into some kind of latent gimmick, like Blend's ability to remain unnoticed if she so desires (although she thinks it's a gadget thing because she once bought a stone from some hawker who told her it's magical). The direction of one's magic can be influenced by one's surroundings, though: e.g. Bottle uses shamanistic magic because his grandma taught him, High Alchemist Baruk is a scholar, and most squad mages seem self-taught warren-users. There's certainly an individual limit to how much power any mage can channel before it begins to affect him physically. Additionally, mages are limited to what warrens (Paths of Magic) they can access by personal inclination and race, with humans having access to more varied but less powerful warrens while most other races have their own racial warren.</li><li> High Priests and Destriants (who are somewhat interchangeable with High Priests) are more cleric-types who gain access to certain powers granted by their deities. Destriants, who are more associated with martial positions completing the trio of a deity's chosen together with the Mortal Sword and Shield-Anvil, tend to gain healing powers, while a normal High Priest's powers are closer to their deity's theme, e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">shadow magic</a>.</li><li> Necromancers seem to be almost their own cathegory as they gain their powers through a combination of inborn talent and an agreement with Hood, the Lord of Death, to play a game with him &#151; they steal as many souls away from under his nose as they can manage and get his respect in return. Otherwise, Hood does not look favourably on those who meddle in his affairs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Our Zombies Are Different</a>: Shurq Elalle is one example &mdash; she is cursed, and even after death by drowning her soul is still connected with body. The setting does have normal zombies, however &mdash; necromancers use them as beasts of labour or as scarecrows for civilians, and other mages and magical beings can raise them if sufficiently motivated. The T'lan Imass could also be considered zombies, a race of undead and undying neanderthal-like warriors that have existed for around 320,000 years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a>: Crokus is an absolutely lethal assassin and knife fighter, whose skills surpass people who were badass in the first book.

It's worth noting that the apostrophe in T'lan Imass does represent a glottal stop, is actually mentioned in-universe as a contraction of "Tellann" and is meant to signify that something is broken. Onos T'oolan used to go without the apostrophe before becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Undead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Undead">undead</a>.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a> K'Chain Che'Malle and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a>, the K'Chain Nah'ruk, are, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a>.
