href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>: In the gospel of Matthew, at His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells His followers that "until heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle [meaning the smallest letter or the tiniest pen mark] will in no way pass from the Law until it is all fulfilled" when He talks about not coming to "destroy [or <em>abolish</em>] the Law and the Prophets" but to fulfill it. Some Bible students interpret that as the Law of Moses still being in effect for believers in Christ, while most others interpret that the same Law was brought to its completion at the cross when Jesus said in the gospel of John, "It is finished."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyElderlyMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyElderlyMother">Absurdly Elderly Mother</a>: In the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel tells the priest Zechariah that his wife Elizabeth is going to have a child. Even though the couple had prayed for a child for many years, Zechariah finds this unbelievable, since they are both old, to which Gabriel renders him mute until the child, whom they named John, is born.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction">Accomplice by Inaction</a>: In the parable of the "sheep and goats" in Matthew chapter 25, Jesus says the King will judge the goats for their doing nothing good for "the least of My brethren", saying that what the "goats" didn't do for them, they also didn't do for the King.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyIAmHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyIAmHim">Actually, I Am Him</a>: Jesus did this from time to time.<ul><li> One example comes from John chapter 9, after curing a man of his blindness:</li></ul><div class="indent">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, &#147;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#148;</div><div class="indent">&#147;Who is he, sir?&#148; the man asked. &#147;Tell me so that I may believe in him.&#148;</div><div class="indent">Jesus said, &#147;You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.&#148;</div><div class="indent">Then the man said, &#147;Lord, I believe,&#148; and worshiped him.</div><ul><li> In an earlier chapter, when Jesus was talking to the Samaritan woman at the well, she said, "I know that the Messiah is coming (who is called Christ); when He comes, He will tell us all things." Jesus says to her, "I, the one speaking to you, am He."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: Jesus liked to give twist endings to common rabbinical parables of the time:<ul><li> the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard describes a variety of laborers who work different amounts of time, building expectation for a lesson about the rewards of hard and patient work. Unexpectedly, Jesus ends the parable with all the workers receiving a day's wage, even those that didn't start working until near the end of the day. A mundane and cliche story turns out to be communicating something much more unexpected.</li><li> the Parable of the Good Samaritan usually ended with a Jewish layman as the third person, both as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against the clergy of the day and to encourage everyday people to engage in random acts of kindness; that the third man was a <em>Samaritan</em> (whom the Jews hated for being of mixed lineage and having impure worship practices) was unthinkable.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysWithYou">Always with You</a>: The last words of the Gospel of Mathew is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a>:<div class="indent"><strong>Jesus</strong>: "<em>Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Allegory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Allegory">Allegory</a>: Most of Jesus' parables fall into this genre. For instance, after telling the Parable of the Sower, Jesus <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">explains to his disciples</a> that the sower is the one who tells the gospel, the seed is the word, and the four different types of soil are four possible responses the hearers may have to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>: The "Give unto Caesar" scene relies on the coins having Caesar's face on them; such coins were not used in Judea prior to the destruction of the Temple in AD 70. The coins the Jews used to pay taxes to the Roman government was the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_shekel">Tyrian shekel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which had another image on it (seen by the Tyrians as Melqart, and by the Romans as Hercules).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">Angel Unaware</a>: In the Judgment of the Sheep and Goats in Matthew chapter 25, Jesus as the great King tells both groups, "I am hungry, and you gave Me food/gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink/gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in/did not invite Me; I was naked, and you clothed Me/did not clothe Me; I was sick, and you visited Me/did not visit Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me/did not come to Me." As both groups ask where they saw Him and ministered (or did not ministered) to Him, He says, "Whenever you did it (or did not do it) to the least of these My brethren, you did it (or did not do it) to Me."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">Anger Born of Worry</a>: In Luke 2, 12-year old Jesus gets lost when the family is returning from Passover in Jerusalem. Mary and Joseph are frantic (this is GOD'S SON they were supposed to keep an eye on!), and they return to Jerusalem to search for Him.

In the Gospel of Luke, the women prepared spices to anoint Jesus' body with, rested on the Sabbath, then came to the tomb on the following day to discover that Jesus' body was no longer in the tomb and that He had risen from the dead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon">The Dutiful Son</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">First appeared</a> as the counterpart to the title character in Jesus' parable of the Prodigal Son. Jesus makes the point that he's not really morally superior to his wayward brother because his dutifulness is not out of love for his father.</li><li> Jesus also told a parable about a father who told his two sons to work in his vineyard. The first one said no, but later went and worked, while the second one said yes, but didn't go. Jesus asked his listeners which son did his father's will, and the answer was the first son, of course.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarAche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarAche">Ear Ache</a>: In all four Gospels, one of Jesus' disciples (mentioned as Peter in the Gospel of John) cuts off the right ear of Malchus, the high priest's servant. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus touches the place where the ear has been cut off and it is healed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">Easy Evangelism</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> by Jesus himself in the Parable of the Sower. Some people just won't hear the message, while others accept the word with joy right away, but then give up just as quickly as soon as the going gets tough. Real faith requires depth and time to grow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyRoadToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyRoadToHell">Easy Road to Hell</a>:<ul><li> Jesus in Matthew 7:13-14 compares the easy road to Hell with the hard road to Heaven:</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"Enter at the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who are going through it, because small is the gate and narrow is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it."</em></div><ul><li> As a corollary to this trope, in the gospel of Luke, when one of His disciples ask, "Lord, are there only a few that will be saved?", and Jesus answers, "Strive to enter into the narrow gate, for many, I say, will try to enter and will not be able."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicEnvironment">Empathic Environment</a>: When Jesus is crucified, the sky turns dark (even though it's three in the afternoon), the curtain in the Temple (before the Holy of Holies) is torn apart and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsDeaderWithZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsDeaderWithZombies">the dead rise again and start walking around</a>.

The former assures that being hated and persecuted for the sake of following God's righteousness leads to great rewards, whereas the latter assures that it's better to have human enemies than to be God's enemy. On the other hand, Jesus also explains that the reason people who follow Him have enemies is mainly that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a>, so He commands us to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">love and pray for our enemies</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">rather than retaliating</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>: In the gospel of Luke, it says that Herod and Pontius Pilate, who were at enmity with each other, became "friends" on the day of Jesus' sentencing and crucifixion, although it wasn't specifically Jesus they were at enmity with &mdash; both saw Jesus as rather harmless &mdash; but rather the Jewish leaders who wanted Jesus dead. They weren't above mocking Jesus, however, since He served simply as a representation of the Jewish people in general.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute">Et Tu, Brute?</a>: Jesus was betrayed by Judas and denied by Peter, two of his closest friends from the inner circle of apostles. Played with in that Jesus knew both events were coming and even foretold them to the disciples, but the betrayals are still treated as shocking. Peter later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">repents and is forgiven</a>, but Judas is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">Everyone Has Standards</a>: Jesus says in the gospels of Matthew and Luke that if parents who are "evil" know how to give good gifts to their children &mdash; saying that such a parent won't give their child a stone if they ask for bread, or a snake if they ask for a fish, or a scorpion if they ask for an egg &mdash; how much more will God the Father, who is always good, give good gifts, including the Holy Spirit, to those who ask Him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a>: The Romans mock Jesus heavily while torturing him before finally killing him, asking him if he's really the King of the Jews. They even put up a sign above his head on the cross reading <em>Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum</em> (Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u9ut');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1u9ut" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u9ut');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And that's where that INRI thing comes from in paintings.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVsEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>: In three of the Gospels, when the Pharisees claim that Jesus' exorcism miracles are done by "the power of Beelzebul", Jesus responds by saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?", and that if it's possible for Satan's power to cast out one of his own evil powers, then his kingdom cannot stand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>: In the gospel of John, Pilate insisted the sign on Jesus' cross should read "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."

It was customary to bring out lower-quality wine after the guests were tipsy, but when Jesus turned water into wine, he turned it into the <em>good</em> stuff and people could tell the difference.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">Face Death with Dignity</a>: Jesus, although how He did this varies among the Gospel accounts. In the Gospel of John, when the guards come for Him, He casually allows them to arrest Him and let His followers go, and even as He endured the brutality of scourging and being crucified, Jesus seems to react with a strangely resigned poise. In the Synoptic Gospels, however, Jesus had to spend some time praying to God the Father in the garden of Gethsemane for either the cup of suffering to pass from Him or just to have His Father's will be done.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn">Faith&#150;Heel Turn</a>: There were a group of disciples in John chapter 6 who decided to turn away from Jesus after hearing the rather hard-to-hear speech about "eating the flesh" and "drinking the blood" of the Son Of Man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFamilyAffair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFamilyAffair">A Family Affair</a>: In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, Herod Antipas has John the Baptist put in prison for daring to rebuke him for his marriage to his brother's wife Herodias, saying that it was not lawful for him to have her. Herodias wanted John the Baptist killed, but Herod spared him because he liked listening to him. It was only after Herodias' daughter danced for Herod, and he made a vow to give her anything she wanted, even "up to half the kingdom", that John the Baptist was finally killed for his brave testimony.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">Famous Last Words</a>: Even these are in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">"Rashomon"-Style</a>: all of the Gospels have Jesus saying different things on the cross. (It's possible he said all of them, just at different times, or maybe it's just artistic license.) These are actually traditionally sermonized as the "Seven Last Sayings of Christ", usually during Holy Friday.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>: Hell. When the collective of demons who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmLegion">self-identify as Legion</a> are about to be exorcised, they break down and beg Jesus to send them anywhere <em>but</em> Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxEmpoweringEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxEmpoweringEntity">Faux Empowering Entity</a>: Satan arguably fills this role as he's tempting Jesus with empty/meaningless promises in the desert.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse">Financial Abuse</a>: An inversion, when Jesus criticized the practice of dedicating property to the Temple to avoid taking care of one's parents. Presumably this was either because of spite or because of a loophole that allowed the owner to use the property while not owning it, thus having his cake and eating it too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireWaterJuxtaposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireWaterJuxtaposition">Fire/Water Juxtaposition</a>: In Matthew and Luke, John the Baptist tells his followers, "I have come baptizing with water, but there is One who comes after me who will baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire." Pentecostals tend to interpret the "baptism of fire" as having the power of the Holy Spirit to do wonders and miracles. However, with the following verse stating "the winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and He will gather the wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire," it seems to suggest that this is talking about the coming judgment of man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfResurrection">First Law of Resurrection</a>: Jesus returns three earthly episodes after his demise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a>: Not quite atheists per se, but some people denied Jesus' divinity even immediately after watching Him perform real-life miracles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheTable">Flipping the Table</a>: Jesus does this with the moneychangers in the Temple.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyInTheSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyInTheSoup">Fly in the Soup</a>: Jesus during His rant against the Pharisees and scribes in Matthew chapter 23 tells them, "You strain out a gnat, yet you swallow a camel!" &mdash; which was how they prefer to enjoy their drinks, pouring them through a cloth in order to strain out insects that would make their beverage "unclean" to drink. However, the point Jesus was making with that statement is that the Pharisees were majoring in the minor things of the Law of God while not also doing the major things in the same Law.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodEnd">Food End</a>: Jesus and the Disciples have breakfast in the last chapter of the Gospel of John.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted">A Fool and His New Money Are Soon Parted</a>: The Prodigal Son in Jesus' parable not only demands his inheritance before his father has even died, he promptly blows through all the money and is reduced to serving pigs before he comes to his senses and goes back home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>: The gospel writers have a tendency to introduce Judas Iscariot as "the one who would betray Him." Jesus also prophesies His death and resurrection on multiple occasions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">Forgiveness</a>: A major concept in Jesus' teachings. Also part of his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">Dying Moment of Awesome</a>, when he prayed "Father, forgive them; they know not what they do."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipDenial">Friendship Denial</a>: Peter does this to Jesus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">three times</a>. Then the rooster crows, Jesus looks at him, and Peter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">becomes remorseful</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>: Jesus. He got quite annoyed with His disciples when they tried to stop children from "bothering" Him, explaining that little children had exemplary faith in the Kingdom of Heaven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOut">Get Out!</a><ul><li> Jesus says in his Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 7:21-23 that many will come to Him on the Last Day and say, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonderful works in Your name?" But then He will say to them, "I never knew you. Depart from Me, you who practice evil."</li><li> The message given to Jesus by the people in the region where He commanded demons that were tormenting a man to enter a herd of swine, after they found out what had happened.</li><li> Some Pharisees in Luke 13:31 warned Jesus to get out because King Herod wanted to kill Him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveTheBabyAFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveTheBabyAFather">Give the Baby a Father</a>: In the gospel of Matthew, when Joseph found out that his future wife Mary was pregnant with a child, he was hesitant on marrying her, suspecting her of committing fornication, and being a righteous man that didn't want to put her in public shame, decided that he was going to divorce her quietly. That was when an angel of God visited him in a dream and told him to take Mary as his wife because the child conceived in her was from the Holy Spirit, and that the child would be named Jesus, for He would deliver His people from their sins. Joseph woke up, did what the angel had commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsWaitAWhile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsWaitAWhile">didn't consummate his marriage with her until she had given birth to Jesus</a>.

Some theorize that the young man was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsert">Mark himself</a> (because he's the only one who mentions the incident in his gospel); the non-canonical <em>Secret Gospel of Mark</em> mentions an earlier incident paralleling the raising of Lazarus in which the resurrected young man later appears to Jesus naked except for essentially the same garment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAndSinNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAndSinNoMore">Go and Sin No More</a>: Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, from Jesus' response to a woman caught in adultery (John 8).<ul><li> Before that, in John chapter 5, when Jesus found the crippled man He healed in the Temple, He tells him, "Sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to you."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise">God Guise</a>:<ul><li> In the gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John, John the Baptist had to deal with people who thought that he was the coming Messiah, and tells them plainly (using a quote from Isaiah) that he was merely sent as a prophet to prepare the way for the Lord's coming, that he himself only baptizes with water, but the Messiah that is coming will baptize "with the Holy Spirit and with fire".</li><li> In the Olivet Discourse, Jesus says many will come in His name, claiming to be the Christ, and will draw many people astray after them, and that there will be false prophets and false Christs that will perform signs and wonders that would, if possible, deceive the very elect.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood">God Is Good</a>: The good news (or gospel, for the more titularly inclined) is that God has taken the form of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNote/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNote/Jesus">Jesus Christ</a>, who has come to tell humanity that God is willing to forgive any wrongdoing so long as one is willing to repent. During the King of Kings's ministry on Earth, he heals the sick, fights off demons, decries the hypocrites, and speaks to the outcasts of societies, from the prostitutes to the unorthodox Samaritans, all while speaking of the need to store treasure in Heaven and love all, even one's enemies. It all culminates in Christ accepting an excruciating death while begging for the forgiveness of those who executed him, only to rise from the dead three days later and proclaim that all who followed him would similarly find new life in Heaven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Gods Need Prayer Badly</a>: In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus found himself unable to perform many miracles in a certain town due to unbelief, since they saw Him merely as the son of a carpenter and not God made manifest in the flesh.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodTest">God Test</a><ul><li> Satan tries to invoke this by suggesting Jesus prove he was the son of God by turning stones into bread. Jesus refused, saying "It is written; Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from God&#700;s mouth." Not to be put off, Satan told him to jump from the roof of the temple, saying "If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." Jesus refuses again, saying "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test.'"</li><li> King Herod (Antipas) tested Jesus on the day of His crucifixion to see if He would do all the miraculous things he had heard about. Jesus did nothing.</li><li> When Jesus is on the cross the authorities challenge him, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</li><li> Played straight by Jesus and Thomas. When Thomas hears of the resurrection, he refuses to believe the story, thinking it incredible. It is not until Jesus shows Thomas his crucifixion wounds that Thomas believes.

In the Gospel of John, during the wedding at Cana, when Jesus' mother informs Him that they ran out of wine, Jesus politely refers to her as "woman" instead of "mother".

The wise virgins tell the foolish ones that there may not be enough for all ten of them if they did that, but that the foolish should go and buy oil for themselves. But while the foolish virgins went to buy oil, the Bridegroom came, took the wise virgins into the wedding feast, and the door was shut.

Even trials of Roman citizens often went this way, as the magistrate was free to admit or ignore any evidence they pleased. Later on Paul, a Roman citizen, was given a trial, but the outcome was never in doubt. The only real privilege they had was that citizens could not be crucified. Thus in Acts Paul is beheaded, while Peter gets crucified (upside down, as he doesn't want it to resemble Jesus' death).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod">Kneel Before Zod</a>: The Devil tries to tempt Jesus into doing this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">but he refuses and tells him off</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">The Law of Conservation of Detail</a>: The last two chapter of John both end with a reminder that Jesus did much, much more than what's recorded, it's just that they only have so much space to record it all in and they need to focus on the essentials.<div class="indent">&#147;Now Jesus did many things in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.

Jewish society played this trope straight, so how could God have Jesus be both biological descendant and legal heir of King David when he has no biological human father? A popular interpretation is that the genealogy presented in Luke is actually through Mary (with the different fathers listed for Joseph being justified as Heli being his father-in-law), meaning both Joseph and Mary can claim to be descendants of the royal line of Judah, making Jesus both a biological descendant of the royal line via Mary and its legal heir via his adoptive father Joseph, who is a direct male descendant of the royal line.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListingTheFormsOfDegenerates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListingTheFormsOfDegenerates">Listing the Forms of Degenerates</a>: In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus lists the things that come from within that would defile a man:<div class="indent"><em>"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adultery, fornication, murder, theft, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride and foolishness."</em> (Mark 7:21-22, Modern English Version)</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiquidAssets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiquidAssets">Liquid Assets</a>:<ul><li> In the gospels of Mark and Luke, Jesus' healing power worked by just a woman with uncontrollable bleeding touching the fringe of His garment, and Jesus sensed this happening even when He had a throng of people pressing toward Him, so the woman made herself known and what she did, and Jesus told her that her faith had saved her and to go in peace. In three of the four Gospels, there was a crowd of people who were healed just by touching the fringe of Jesus' garment.</li><li> There were a few instances where Jesus performed healings on people without necessarily being there to perform them. In the gospels of Matthew and Luke, a centurion had a servant at home who was ill who came to Jesus to ask for a healing, but said, "I am not worthy to have You come into my home, but say the word, and my servant will be healed." Jesus commended the centurion for his faith and thus granted his request. In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, a Canaanite/Syro-Phoenician woman came to Jesus and begged for Him to cast out a demon from her daughter. Jesus initially refused at first, saying, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not fitting to give the children's food to the dogs," but when the woman said, "True, Lord, but even the dogs will eat the crumbs off the children's table," Jesus commended her for her faith and thus granted her request. In the gospel of John, an official came to Jesus to ask for healing for his son, and was told by Jesus to return home because his son will live, and thus returned home to find that his son was healed at the same hour that Jesus spoke.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">Long List</a>: The gospel of Luke includes a very long list of Jesus' genealogy that reaches all the way back to Adam.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Love Redeems</a>: Very, very much the theme of Jesus' teachings, as exemplified in John 3:16:<div class="indent"> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a>: In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, when Jesus tells His disciples that He is going to Jerusalem to be crucified, Peter pulls Jesus aside and rebukes Him for making such a statement. Jesus in turn says, "Get behind Me, Satan. For you do not savor the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."

The Jewish leaders debate among themselves over what to answer, realizing that if they said "from heaven", then they would have to endure Jesus telling them "Then why didn't you believe him?", but if they answered "from men", they feared that they would be stoned, because the people believed that John the Baptist was a prophet.

In the Gospel of John, the teachers of the Law present him with a woman caught in adultery and says that the Law of Moses demanded that such women should be stoned. They expected him to answer either a yes or a no so they could find a way to accuse Him. Instead, Jesus answered, "Let he who is without sin be the first to cast a stone at her." In three of the Gospels, some Herodians ask whether it is lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not for similar reasons, but after Jesus asks for a denarius and they say it has Caesar's face and inscription on it, Jesus answers, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MummyWrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MummyWrap">Mummy Wrap</a>: In Luke chapter 2, the baby Jesus after He was born was wrapped in "swaddling clothes", which was most likely burial wrapping that travelers in the region of Israel were advised to carry in case someone in their caravan had died.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode">Musical Episode</a> - Luke chapter 1 is chock full of moments where people just burst into song.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">My Friends... and Zoidberg</a>:<ul><li> The attitude above under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService">Intimidating Revenue Service</a> sets up the following plum bit of narration in <a class="urllink" href="http://bible.cc/luke/7-29.htm">Luke 7:29<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: "When all the people and the tax collectors heard this..."</li><li> After His resurrection, Jesus tells the women to "Go tell his disciples and Peter."

Why he's called St. Jude instead of St. Thaddeus, making Jesus' brother the only "Jude" (which would be far less confusing), is still a mystery. Some countries make a compromise by referring to him, in full, as "Judas Thaddeus".</li></ul></li><li> The Book of John, written by John the Apostle, opens up by introducing another John, John the Baptist.</li><li> Also, depending how you count, there may be as many as four women (and definitely at least two) named Mary.

At the same time, Moses and Elijah appear talking to Jesus, and a voice from the sky declares "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!" (Mark 9), revealing Jesus' divine nature.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Playing with Fire</a>: In the gospel of Luke, Jesus sent His disciples into a Samaritan village to get things ready for Him, but they did not receive Him as He was heading for Jerusalem. His disciples asked if He wanted them to command fire to come down on that village just like Elijah. Jesus rebuked them for making such a suggestion, saying, &#147;You do not know what kind of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men&#146;s lives but to save them.&#148;<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note785yh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note785yh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note785yh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The rebuke quote is found only in the King James Version as well as the translations that use the Textus Receptus for its New Testament.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination">Positive Discrimination</a>: The Samaritans are depicted in a positive light several times, most famously in the story of the Good Samaritan. This is because they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableEthnicTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableEthnicTargets">Acceptable Ethnic Targets</a> at the time and there was a lot of mutual enmity between them and the Jews.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>:<ul><li> Jesus deals with the issue of pride by saying "he who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted." As an example, He tells the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, who were both praying to God. The Pharisee proudly declares his "righteousness" before God in his prayer, even denouncing the tax collector who was right next to him, while the tax collector humbly beats his chest and says, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner"...and Jesus says that the tax collector went home justified before God rather than the Pharisee.</li><li> The dutiful son in the parable of the prodigal son also has a pride issue. He sees their father receive the prodigal son back into the fold by giving him a party with the fattened calf slaughtered, and he gets upset with the father, saying to the effect that he should have been rewarded in like fashion for obeying all his father's commands and not wasting his inheritance on prostitutes, going so far as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">not even acknowledge his own brother in the process</a>. The father says, "Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found."</li><li> Martha the sister of Mary also has a bit of a pride issue. When she invites Jesus into her home in the gospel of Luke, her sister Mary spends her time sitting at Jesus' feet listening to Him while Martha is distracted with getting things ready for a supper she was putting on for Him. Annoyed at her sister not doing anything to help while she was doing all the busywork, Martha bids the Lord to tell Mary to help her. The Lord tells her, &#147;Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things. But one thing is needed. And Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.&#148;</li><li> The apostles themselves were dealing with pride as they were wondering who among them would be considered the greatest. Jesus tells them "Whoever would be great among you, let him serve you, and whoever would be first among you, let him be your slave, even as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many." (Matthew 20:26-28) As an act of showing humility, Jesus even washed the feet of His disciples, telling them if that is what He has done for them, blessed are they if they do the same for others.</li><li> Peter himself had to deal with pride rearing its ugly head on a few occasions. In Matthew chapter 16, he gets an ego boost when he declares to Jesus, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," and Jesus at that point gives him "the keys to the kingdom of heaven", then just shortly thereafter when Jesus says that He has to go to the cross and suffer and die, and Peter attempts to rebuke Him, Jesus says, "Get behind Me, Satan, for you do not savor the things of God, but the things of men." Later on, when Jesus predicts that His disciples will scatter from Him upon His arrest, and Peter boldly declares that he won't be like the others, Jesus says, "Tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times," and Peter again asserts his steadfastness. However, when Jesus' Words prove to be true, Peter was crushed in his inner being, and it was only after Jesus asked Peter three times "Do you love Me?" after His resurrection that Peter was restored.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExecution">Public Execution</a>: Jesus' crucifixion alongside two criminals, as told in all four Gospels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposeDrivenImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposeDrivenImmortality">Purpose-Driven Immortality</a>: In the gospel of Luke, an old man named Simeon was told by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Christ. The minute he saw Joseph and Mary bring the infant Jesus into the Temple to dedicate Him to the Lord, he took Jesus in his arms and said, &#147;Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word; for my eyes have seen Your salvation which You have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.&#148; (Luke 2:29-32)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>: Jesus asks the question in Matthew 16:26, "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVillainy">Pyrrhic Villainy</a>: Judas Iscariot may have gotten a "tidy sum" of thirty pieces of silver for betraying Jesus, but according to Matthew, he was so overcome with guilt that he hanged himself. Apparently waiting to receive the inheritance that God promised to those who believe in Him through His Son, plus the honor his fellow apostles would have of sitting on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel, was not enough to persuade Judas from settling for a mere pittance of earthly treasure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine">Quote Mine</a>: Satan using a few verses in Psalm 91 in order to tempt Jesus from jumping off the high point of the Temple. He quotes it as "He shall give His angels charge over you," and, "In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone." When the actual verses are "For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone." Granted, this is only a translation of what was actually said, but still Jesus knew what Satan was trying to do there and counters with quoting Scripture accurately.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteToQuoteCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteToQuoteCombat">Quote-to-Quote Combat</a>: In Luke 4 Satan tries to tempt Jesus into throwing himself from the highest point in the temple and quotes from the Psalms out of context and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine">Quote Mined</a> to suggest that God will prevent Jesus from falling to his death.

Some theologians who analyze this part note that the fact of women learning religion just like men (or better than them, since it's a group of women, Martha and Mary among them, who get to be the first to know about the Resurrection and believe in it!) was quite a sensation in the 1st century AD-Middle East.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrug of God</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>; Jesus warns against believing rumors that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndIsNigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndIsNigh">The End Is Nigh</a>, because not even He as the Son of God knows when the end of the world is.

Another parable He uses to make that same point is a person shamelessly knocking on his neighbor's door at night to give him some bread that he can set before his guests to eat, saying that the neighbor won't give him what he wants just because he is his friend, but simply to get his neighbor to stop disturbing him and his family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalEclipseOfThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalEclipseOfThePlot">Total Eclipse of the Plot</a>: According to Mark, Luke and Matthew, a period of darkness occurred during Jesus' crucifixion, lasting from noon to 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Of the three evangelists that mention the three-hour darkness, Luke is the only one who seems to imagine it as an eclipse ("the sun's light failed"), whereas Mark and Matthew only say that "darkness fell over all the land" (or possibly, "the entire world"). Solar eclipses generally last a few minutes (as opposed to hours), and also the Gospels say that Jesus was crucified on the first day of Passover, which is held at full moon when solar eclipses cannot occur.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet">Trash the Set</a><ul><li> A lucrative business of changing "unclean" foreign currency to "proper" Temple shekels and selling animals "acceptable" for sacrifice had sprung up in the Court of Gentiles (and it was very likely that the priests were in on this business, so guess what they always said was unacceptable?). Jesus was having none of it because Jewish people who wanted to worship God were being gouged and Gentiles who wanted to worship God had to put up with the noise and smell of a marketplace. So he turned the money changers' tables over and drove out both the animals and unscrupulous businessmen. Then he sat down to teach.</li><li> Jesus in the Olivet Discourse predicts the destruction of the Temple, which in extra-Biblical accounts took place in 70 AD.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>: Satan tries to use his tactics that worked on Adam and Eve on Jesus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">Not only does it not work</a> but he gets chewed out by Jesus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Turn the Other Cheek</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>. From the Sermon on the Mount in the gospel of Matthew, Jesus says, &#147;You have heard that it was said, &#145;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&#146; But I say to you, do not resist an evil person. But whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other as well. And if anyone sues you in a court of law and takes away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. And whoever compels you to go a mile, go with him two." (Matthew 5:38-41) Jesus advocates responding to personal aggression and violence with non-violence instead of returning evil for evil.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFirstNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFirstNames">Two First Names</a>: John Mark and Simon Peter. Although Simon Peter was originally Simon bar-Jonah (or Simon son-of-Jonah). Jesus later gave him the name Peter, which means "rock". He then went by Simon Peter before just sticking with Peter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncleanlinessIsNextToUngodliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncleanlinessIsNextToUngodliness">Uncleanliness Is Next to Ungodliness</a>:<ul><li> In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, the Pharisees find fault with Jesus and His disciples for not washing their hands before they eat, with the gospel of Mark going into explaining why the Pharisees do this, and ask Him, "Why do Your disciples transgress against the tradition of the elders?" Jesus in turn asks them, "Why do you transgress against the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?" and tells them about one of their traditions that goes against the commandment of God, namely the Corban tradition that goes against "honor your father and your mother." He goes on to say that eating with unwashed hands does not defile a man, for food only goes into a man's stomach and then into the sewer, "thus purging all foods," but rather what comes out of a man's heart is what defiles him.</li><li> In the parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke chapter 10, the priest and the Levite as they see the wounded man on the road pass by on the other side, presumably to keep themselves from being defiled by touching what seemed to be a dead body.</li><li> The woman with the uncontrollable bleeding for twelve years was in a bind, as the book of Leviticus states that a woman who has bleeding long past the time of her usual period was considered "unclean" and thus could not enter into the sanctuary of God until her bleeding stopped. As she spent all her money on being cured of this problem, but only made it worse, she in desperation reached out to touch the hem of Jesus' garment, and instantly her bleeding stopped. Jesus turned to address the woman that touched Him, and told her to go in peace and be healed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdressedForTheOccasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdressedForTheOccasion">Underdressed for the Occasion</a>: The parable of the wedding guests in Matthew 22:1-14 has the host of the wedding gather as many people off the streets as his servants can, both good and bad, so he can fill the house with guests to replace the ones that refused and were found unworthy of attending. However, as the host of the wedding inspects the guests, he finds one who isn't wearing a wedding garment and asks how he managed to get in without one. The guest is rendered speechless. The host of the wedding then says to his servants, "Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Jesus ends the parable with "For many are called, but few are chosen."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">The Underworld</a>: Hades and Gehenna (most commonly referred to as Hell with hardly any distinction in most English translations) are mentioned by Jesus as places that the wicked and unbelieving will go to, with Hades being the grave and Gehenna (based on the Valley of Ben Hinnom, which at that time was being used as a garbage dump) being where "the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44,46,48, quoting Isaiah 66:24).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastards</a>:<ul><li> Jesus healed ten lepers, and only one of them, a Samaritan, bothered to thank Him.</li><li> Jesus also told the parable of a man who, after having his debts forgiven by his master, went after and bullied a fellow servant who owed him a mere pittance in comparison.</li><li> Jesus' parable of the two debtors who were forgiven their debts by the moneylender, told in the gospel of Luke to Simon the Pharisee in regard to a sinful woman visiting Him during a dinner, shows that the level of gratitude shown to God for His forgiveness is dependent on how much one has been forgiven of their sins: that whoever loves much is one who is forgiven of much, while whoever loves little is one who is forgiven of little.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium">Unstable Equilibrium</a>: The Parable of the Talents ends with the famous Matthew Effect: "For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed Trope</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>.<ul><li> Rumors were flying all over the place about Jesus' true identity, whether he be Elijah, a new prophet, or something else, and only Peter gets it right by calling him the Son of Man.</li><li> In the Gospel of John the author dismisses a rumor that "the disciple Jesus loved" wouldn't die&mdash;no, Jesus only said "<em>if</em> I wanted him to live until I came, what's that to you?"<ul><li> The Mormons still took it literally, and Joseph Smith even claimed to have met John.</li><li> Others have used this to explain how Jesus' claim that there were some standing with him would be alive at the end of time could be true. In their view, John is around here somewhere, waiting, even now.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>: The title character in the Parable of the Unrighteous Steward is a crooked accountant who, on finding out that he is due to be fired, uses creative bookkeeping to swindle his boss and get into good graces with future employers. (Alternately, it can be interpreted as the steward removing the markup on what his master's clients owed the master &mdash; the cut that the steward would get from being the middleman in the transaction &mdash; by reducing the debt to what they actually owed the master.) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> is that if even a sleazeball like this guy knows how to be shrewd with money, how much more should we be wise about things with eternal value.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater">Walk on Water</a>: Jesus did this on the Sea of Galilee, when His disciples went ahead of Him and He went alone on a mountain to pray and then later joined them. When the disciples were struggling with the waves on the sea, they were frightened at first to see Jesus just casually walking on top of the water like it was nothing and thought it was a ghost, until Jesus tells them that it is He and to not be afraid. In the gospel of Matthew, Peter gets out of the boat when Jesus calls him and so briefly walks on the water until he takes his eyes off Jesus and starts to sink. Jesus reaches out and pulls Peter up, saying, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency">Wants a Prize for Basic Decency</a>: Jesus speaks about this attitude to His followers in Luke 17:7-10:<div class="indent"><em>&#147;Which of you, having a servant plowing or herding sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, &#145;Come now and sit down for dinner&#146;? Will he not rather say to him, &#145;Prepare my supper, and dress yourself and serve me until I eat and drink. And afterward you will eat and drink&#146;? Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? I think not. So you also, when you have done everything commanded you, say, &#145;We are unprofitable servants. We have done our duty.&#146;&#148;</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a>: Occurs quite famously in both Matthew and Luke, where Satan tempts Jesus with control over the entire Earth. Jesus' choice is fairly obvious. This has interesting theological implications: Jesus rejects the offer, but never implies that Satan couldn't deliver. Therefore, Satan apparently has some degree of authority over the kingdoms of Earth.<ul><li> In fact, John 12:31 describes Satan as the "ruler of this world."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>: In John 12, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">voice speaks from heaven</a>, and many people in the crowd think it's just thunder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Jesus' stepfather Joseph, who appears in the first few chapters of Matthew and Luke, but is hardly heard from beyond that other than just other characters mentioning his name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsEvil">What Is Evil?</a>: In the gospel of John, when Pilate asks Jesus if He is a king, and Jesus answers in the affirmative, adding "For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice," Pilate responds only with "What is truth?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Jesus encourages His followers to invoke this if other followers do something wrong in Luke 17:3:<div class="indent"><em>Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat">Who Will Bell the Cat?</a>: The story of Jesus with the woman caught in adultery in John chapter 8 is a perfect example. The Jewish leaders who brought the woman to Him wanted Him to pass judgment on her so they could have something to accuse Him of. Instead, Jesus says to them, "Let the one who is without sin cast the first stone." Realizing that none of them qualify as being "the one who is without sin", they all left one by one, leaving Jesus alone with the woman, who is then let go and told not to sin anymore.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a>: Jesus states in passages such as Matthew 12:30 and Luke 11:23 that if you're not for Him, then you're against Him. In other words, neutrality in Him doesn't exist, and the person will either accept Him as savior or not.<ul><li> Inverted in Mark 9:38-41 and Luke 9:49-50, where the disciples wanted to stop another exorcist from casting out demons because he was not following them, but Jesus chastised them, saying "Whoever is not against us is for us."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWolfInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWolfInSheepsClothing">A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</a>: Jesus warns His followers in His Sermon on the Mount in the gospel of Matthew to beware of false prophets "who come to you in sheep&#146;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves." He also warns in His parable of the wheat and tares that the tares (agriculturally, a type of weed that resembles wheat called darnel) are "the sons of the devil" that are sown among the wheat, which will be bundled up and burned by the angels who will reap the fields at the end of the age.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordsCanBreakMyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordsCanBreakMyBones">Words Can Break My Bones</a>: Jesus' Words can do a lot of things: calm storms, bring healing to people, cast out demons, even knock people on their butts at one point. In John chapter 18, when Judas Iscariot came with the Temple guards to arrest Jesus, Jesus asked, "Whom are you seeking?", and the guards answered, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus responded with, "I am He" (or more literally, just "I AM"), which, when He said that, caused Judas and the guards to fall to the ground. Jesus tells His disciples that if they have faith even as small as a mustard seed, they could go tell a mountain to remove itself, and it would obey them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero">Working-Class Hero</a>: Jesus is the only major religious figure who is explicitly defined as either a carpenter/itinerant laborer challenging the more aristocratic gods of classical religions and the more intellectual scholar-based tradition of Jewish priests. He also identified with the outcasts of society (the vagabonds, the prostitutes) and affirmed that rich people have a hard time getting to heaven and his only significant violent action was removing the money changers from the temple. His Apostles are also largely workers, especially Peter, who meets Jesus after coming back from a fishing job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongfullyAttributed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongfullyAttributed">Wrongfully Attributed</a>: In the gospel of Matthew, for some strange reason, a quote from Zechariah was attributed by the author to Jeremiah (possibly thinking of the passage where Jeremiah bought a field from his cousin Hanamel, being prophetic to Judas Iscariot's money being used by the priests to buy the potter's field):<div class="indent"><em>Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: &#147;They took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of that the sons of Israel set on Him, and gave them for the potter&#146;s field, as the Lord appointed me.&#148;</em> (Matthew 27:9-10, actually quoting from Zechariah 11:12-13)</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanLeaveYourHatOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanLeaveYourHatOn">You Can Leave Your Hat On</a>: Implied in the Matthew and Mark accounts with Herodias' daughter dancing before her stepfather Herod Antipas and his associates on his birthday, making him so pleased that he would give her anything she asked for, up to half his kingdom. She takes the opportunity to ask for what her mother wanted: John the Baptist's head on a platter. Herod felt sorry that she asked for that, but nevertheless gave her what she wanted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool">You Fool!</a>: Jesus warns in His Sermon On The Mount that calling somebody a "fool" out of malicious anger would make that person likely to be punished with hellfire.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13cgpa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13cgpa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13cgpa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When He proceeds to denounce the Pharisees and scribes in His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> as "fools and blind" later on, it's out of justified or righteous anger over their own religious hypocrisy. There's also the fact that the word translated as fool, moros, in the Sermon on the Mount is thought to have had the secondary meaning of "godless" or "apostate", a serious insult for Jesus's time. Which explains why Jesus would have condemned calling someone that out of malicious anger in the first place.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeverDidThatForMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeverDidThatForMe">You Never Did That for Me</a>:<ul><li> Happens at the end of the parable of The Prodigal Son, where the brother who <em>didn't</em> leave home and waste all his money wonders why he doesn't get a fatted calf.</li><li> Also in the latter half of the Parable of the Sheep and Goats, the King (implied to be Jesus) says to those who are doomed to destruction in the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, "Whatsoever you didn't do for the least of My brethren, you didn't do for Me."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">Your Days Are Numbered</a>: In Jesus' parable of the rich foolish farmer in the Gospel of Luke, in which the farmer who has a bountiful crop thinks he has all the time in the world to enjoy what he has, only to be told by God, "You fool, tonight your soul will be required of you. Then whose will those things be which you have provided for yourself?"</li></ul><hr>
