Canadian writer Leslie McFarlane was the original writer of the first 16 books, writing them only to pay his bills and feed his family (getting ~$100 US for each book, with no royalties, which wasn't all that bad at the time; a large number of the original Stratemeyer ghostwriters were journalists, and using journalist salaries as comparison, $100 per book was roughly six weeks' salary for four weeks' work), and dreaded having to write the books (referring to the books in his diary as "the damn juveniles"), and by the mid-30s other writers began to write the books as well (such as John Button, whose books are infamous for their use of sci-fi elements, inconsistencies, and strange plots), leaving McFarlane free to forget about the books and write his own stories.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In the late 1950s until the early '70s, the first 38 books were revised and rewritten to update the stories, eliminating outdated terminology ("chum", "roadster", etc.), removing politically incorrect terms and stereotypes ("Negro", "swarthy foreigner", "Chinaman", "colored", etc.), and shortening the books from 25 chapters to 20 chapters. Newer books were also made, with the "original" series coming to an end in 1979 with #58. The original editions can be recognized by having dust jackets and plain brown (and later, tan "tweed") covers; the revised versions, beginning in 1961, have the cover picture printed directly on the book to better withstand being used and abused by kids.</p><p>After the books were acquired by Simon &amp; Schuster (which took control of Grosset &amp; Dunlap in the 70s after a lawsuit), the series was continued as "Digests". Later on, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <em>Casefiles</em> series was added and ran concurrently with the Digests. Both series have since been discontinued, the <em>Casefiles</em> in 1998 and the Digests in 2005. The series has since continued under the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> subtitle, which reinvents the brothers as agents working for an all-teen secret agency; there is also a corresponding graphic novel series.

Seconds later, the boys get a phone call from the man's business partner, who <em>has</em> in fact been looking through the books and found evidence of embezzlement. The book ends with them chuckling about the irony.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">Adaptation Name Change</a>: Happens sometimes between the originals and the reprints. In the original version of "Hunting for Hidden Gold" Bart Dawson's prospecting partners were the Coulsen Brothers (Jack and Bill) and Jadbury Wilson.

Just look at their close circle: Frank, Joe, Tony, Phil, Jerry, and Callie are quite common, Chet and Biff are marginal (and nicknames for Chester and Allen, anyway), but Iola just completely sticks out. Considering she was replaced with a girl named "Vanessa" in the <em>Casefiles,</em> it's possible the publishers thought so, too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels">All Bikers Are Hells Angels</a>: The Sinbads, who appear in a <em>Casefiles</em> book, fit this pretty well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly">Aloof Ally</a>: In the <em>Casefiles</em> series, the Gray Man and, by extension, the Network he works for.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>: There's several different continuities, as the publishers try to keep the series relevant to modern kids. There's the "Blue Spines", which is the blue hardcover books &amp; digests (and that's broken down to the Original Texts and the rewrites of the '70s), the <em>Casefiles</em>, <em>Undercover Brothers</em>, the <em>Clues Brothers</em>, the new <em>Adventures</em> series, and the second "New Case Files" series which has little to do with the first. The various TV incarnations (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHardyBoysNancyDrewMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHardyBoysNancyDrewMysteries">The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> (the best known), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub">The Mickey Mouse Club</a> serials of the 50s, and <em>The Hardy Boys</em> of the '90s) are also considered separate continuities, with varying degrees of faithfulness to the printed tales.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Amnesiac Hero</a>:<ul><li> In both versions of "Hunting for Hidden Gold", Bart Dawson lost his memory due to an injury received at the hands of thieves while he was fleeing with the titular gold to draw the thieves away from his partners. In the original draft, his memory came back gradually over the years, causing him to find one of the Coulsen Brothers as he went back to retrieve the gold. In the reprint, his memory only returns much later (at the cost of losing the memories of the new life he established while amnesiac) when he encounters one of the villains by chance and is struck in the head by him during a scuffle, assisting the brothers in the final act afterwards.</li><li> The original version of "The Secret of the Caves" has the boys looking for someone named Todham Todd. During their investigation, they encounter a violent and highly insane man who goes by "Captain Royal" living in the caves off the coast, who holds them prisoner and attempts to kill them multiple times. It turns out that Captain Royal is actually an amnesiac Todd, and after being knocked unconscious and left comatose, he gets his original memories back when he wakes up, and turns out to be a perfectly nice, harmless person who has no recollection of the violent alternate life he lived as Royal.</li><li> Joe himself becomes one in "Brother Against Brother" of the <em>Casefiles</em>. When he's sent on a mission to warn a father and daughter in witness protection that a hitman is coming for them, said hitman ambushes him, locks him in a car, and pushes the car over a cliff. Joe survives, but doesn't remember his name and only has a vague recollection that he had something important to do. The incident also causes his memories of Frank to become warped enough that he spends most of the book thinking that his brother, who eventually followed after Joe on the mission to save him when he disappeared, is the hitman. Joe's unable to prevent the father from being murdered, but does manage to protect the daughter, and after Frank shows up to rescue both of them, Joe finally gets his memory back.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>: CBS had a cartoon version which ran 34 episodes from 1969-1971.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerCut">Answer Cut</a>: In "The Borgia Dagger" from the Casefiles series, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a> Tessa Carpenter loses most of her money, the brothers reflect on how she has to get a job now, but wonder what she'd possibly be skilled enough to do.

In "Speed Times Five" from the Digest series, Kelly Hawk invokes this while balking at her crew's suggestion that they cheat, telling them in no uncertain terms to either drop the subject or quit, since 1) they'd probably get caught if they tried, 2) it would shame their friends and families whether they got away with it or not, and 3) she has a good chance of winning honestly anyway (which she does).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsHobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsHobby">Chekhov's Hobby</a>: Mostly in the Originals/Digests:<ul><li> Chet Morton and his loads of hobbies that seems to change for each book.</li><li> Frank and Joe are both guilty of this too.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewOutFakeOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewOutFakeOut">Chew-Out Fake-Out</a>: By the end of the <em>Casefiles</em> book "Blown Away", Frank and Joe have uncovered an international conspiracy, saved two African countries (Bhotai and Katara), and cleared the name (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate">Acquitted Too Late</a>) of their friend's boss (and mentor) from smuggling charges.

This is their only crossover series that doesn't feature any romance between the Hardys and Nancy or her friends; they're just platonic friends who've known each other a long time.</li><li> The first "Super Mysteries" line has the <em>Casefiles</em> continuity and the corresponding <em>Nancy Drew Files</em>, and is by far their longest-running crossover at 36 volumes. Once again, the Hardys and Nancy already know each other at the time of the first book, having first met when Nancy was an exchange student in Bayport.</li><li> The second "Super Mysteries" combines <em>Undercover Brothers</em> and Nancy Drew's <em>Girl Detective</em> series, and is also 6 books. This time around, the boys meet Nancy and her friends for the first time in the first book, wherein the girls become some of the very few people to learn about their work with ATAC and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret-Keepers</a> for them for all subsequent volumes.</li><li> While the <em>Hardy Boys Adventures</em> and <em>Nancy Drew Diaries</em> don't have a full crossover series, the Hardys guest-star in the <em>Diaries</em> Christmas special, "A Nancy Drew Christmas", which is also referenced once in <em>Adventures</em>. Like the above example, this book is the first time that the brothers and Nancy meet in this continuity.</li><li> There have been several crossovers in various graphic novels as well, including with their respective ongoing graphic novels series as well as several one-shot stories by different authors using both sets of characters.</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Casefiles</em> continuity crosses over with the 90s series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomSwift">Tom Swift</a></em> in the two "Ultra Thriller" books.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a>:<ul><li> Bayport police chief Ezra Collig, whom the boys frequently end up working with during their Bayport-based investigations (usually by solving the cases before the police can).

Iola Morton is Joe's long-running girlfriend in the original series, and gets blown up by terrorists seconds before the opening scene of <em>the first book</em>. Not to mention that some cases would place tension between the brothers, which would often lead into not-so-friendly brawls between them. Later, it also modifies their relationship with the police (which is scarcely a problem in the original series), with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> of sorts in Con Riley as the only officer that takes their skills seriously.

And then there are the Assassins, the terrorist group responsible for Iola's aforementioned murder, and are also the most frequently recurring villains in the series who, well...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">do exactly what you might expect</a>.</li><li> To a lesser extent, the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> series to the originals and Digests, which it directly replaces/succeeds as the main <em>Hardy Boys</em> canon (unlikes the <em>Casefiles</em>, which is a spin-off series). Though <em>Undercover Brothers</em> isn't <strong>as</strong> graphic as the <em>Casefiles</em>, almost every book still includes at least one death (occurring either before the story as the case that the brothers have to solve, during the plot itself, or both); in contrast, the originals and Digests, while certainly having many cases of the villains <em>trying</em> to kill the boys, contained very few actual deaths.<ul><li> One particular example for the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> series would be the Lost Mystery Trilogy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0p944');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0p944" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0p944');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">consisting of books 34-36 in the series: "The Children of the Lost", "Lost Brother", and "Forever Lost"</span>, where the criminals abduct children and raise them in an underground bunker designed like a preschool in a <em>very</em> misguided attempt to give them happier, more carefree lives than what they would have in the real world. All the children are kidnapped from normal, loving families when they're very young, and some of them have lived <em>more than half their lives</em> away from their parents. The kids are regularly drugged in an attempt to alter their memories and make them forget about everyone they used to know; they all miss their families and want to go home, but have to pretend to be happy there or they'll be pumped full of more drugs. Frank is later captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> as well to be added to the "collection", while Joe is left frantically searching for him. The story is chock-full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a> as it doesn't shy away from showing how emotionally devastating and heartbreaking it is for the families of these children to lose them and believe they'll never see them again. To top it off, this is one of the only aversions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality">Infant Immortality</a> in the entire series; one of the kids, a little girl under 10, died before the events of the story from being given too many of the drugs. All in all, it seems way more like something you'd expect to see on an adult crime procedural rather than a children's series like The Hardy Boys.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: Both of them in every continuity, very much so, but Joe in particular. They've been addressed and referred to as "wise guys" on more than one occasion, by friends, foes, and everyone in between, and have back-sassed the bad guys so many times that you have to wonder how they didn't get themselves shot in the face long ago.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation">Death by Adaptation</a>: In the original version of "Hunting for Hidden Gold", one of the Coulsen Brothers (two of the four prospectors who mined the titular gold) is dead, while the other one is trying to recover it along with Bart Dawson.

After escaping, Frank turns to his father for a profile on the guy. Fenton's file mentions that Cutter got his alias because he used to be a master safecracker with a large amount of luck. He changed his criminal profession when his luck ran out one day with his acetylene torch...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">Family-Unfriendly Death</a>:<ul><li> The <em>Casefiles</em> series doesn't hold back in how murders are committed. And since more than half of these books deal with such a crime, there are plenty of them.</li><li> The <em>Undercover Brothers</em> series isn't quite as graphic, but considering that most books in the series still contain at least one death, it has some of these too.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBestFriend">Fat Best Friend</a>: Chet Morton is the best friend of the Hardy Boys, and has been described as fat, plump, chubby, stout, heavy-set, etc. He has a huge appetite, and vacillates between types A, B and C as the plot dictates.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">Females Are More Innocent</a>: Zigzagged throughout the series:<ul><li> Played quite straight in the original series, where almost all of the villains are male. At worst, women who are part of the gang of bad guys are accomplices who aren't involved in the gang's most villainous deeds (such as attempted murder), and other times, they are unwitting accomplices.</li><li> Downplayed in the Digests. There are more female villains there, but they're more likely to be conflicted about what they're doing and make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">High-Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.</li><li> Largely averted with the <em>Casefiles</em>, <em>Undercover Brothers</em>, and <em>Adventures</em>.

This could get especially bad in the crossovers with Nancy Drew; since these books tend to put more focus on Nancy overall, Joe is, in many of them, reduced primarily to his shallower character traits.</li><li> <em>Undercover Brothers</em> gets worse about this later on, and by the time it ends, both boys are barely even recognizable as the same guys from the beginning of the series, let alone from other series.<ul><li> This time, Frank probably gets it worse, as his nerdiness gets emphasized more and more to the extent that he and Joe practically become polar opposites. At one point, Frank states that his favorite movie from a previous year was a <em>documentary about ladybugs</em>. Probably the most egregious example is that, in "Comic Con Artist" (book #21), both Joe and Frank are shown and stated to be comic book fans and are excited to immerse themselves in a ComicCon scene, but then in the Deathstalker Trilogy (books #37-39), Frank acts like comic books are for little kids, states that he stopped reading them a long time ago and now prefers a "higher class" of literature, and scoffs at Joe for still being a fan.</li><li> Joe, meanwhile, has his confidence and positive attitude dialed up to the point of sometimes being a braggart, even arrogant, and comes across as a downright ditz in a few books.</li><li> Thankfully, the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> graphic novels series averts this, keeping both boys' characters fairly intact throughout.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn">Food Porn</a>: The series originally included extended, lavish descriptions of meals. Stratemeyer reasoned that since teenage boys have huge appetites, they'd appreciate such detail. Later editions of the earlier volumes saw such passages removed, in accordance with the growing preference of young readers for dialogue and action over description.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a>: Happens to the brothers on occasion, and also to the guest characters. A few examples out of many are the Rideaus in the revised text of "The Melted Coins", Slim Davenport in the <em>Casefiles</em> book "Dead Man in Deadwood", and David Kidwell in the Digest book "The Desert Thieves".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebooks</a>: The "Be a Detective" series, which ran for six books and was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> with Nancy Drew.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a>: Happens pretty often in the <em>Casefiles</em> series, although they usually tend to go for Joe (or one of the other non-Hardy males); the ones who have eyes for Frank have to be let down gently in the end because he's with Callie, of course.<ul><li> The Frank/Callie relationship in the <em>Casefiles</em> is further enforced by the fact that, interestingly, nearly every single time that Frank <em>is</em> actually attracted to the other girl and seems like he might have a fling with her, she turns out to be one of the bad guys (minus Nancy Drew, of course). Even some of the girls he <em>does</em> turn down are bad guys. This sometimes happens to Joe, too, of course, but not nearly as much, proportionally, as it does to Frank.</li><li> Goes in the opposite direction in the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> series. Frank, who is painfully shy around women and is easily flustered, seems to have every girl he sees fall for him, while Joe, who claims to be a smooth womanizer, can barely get the time of day. He has no clue how Frank does it.</li><li> The <em>Adventures</em> series has both boys be about equally popular with girls; usually only one or the other has a love interest in any given book. Even when they are officially dating these girls, they've <em>still</em> broken up with her for one reason or another by the end of the book or the start of the next one.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction">Government Agency of Fiction</a>:<ul><li> The Network from the <em>Casefiles</em>, a CIA/Interpol-like spy agency of the "so secret it doesn't officially exist" variety. Fenton Hardy has had dealings with them before, and the boys themselves begin working with them in the first book of the series and do so again many times, eventually to the point of being unofficial part-time freelance agents whom the Network sometimes contacts outright to assign them cases, though just as often, they end up getting involved in Network cases completely by accident. Their main contact at the Network is the Gray Man, or "Mr. Gray", who is essentially the second-in-command of the whole agency and acts as a cross between a mentor and handler for them.</li><li> The <em>Casefiles</em> also has U.S. Espionage Resources (sometimes abbreviated to U.S.E.R.), which only shows up in a few early books and one of the Tom Swift Ultra Thriller crossovers. They're more publicly known than the Network, and act their rival agency in terms of government funding and prestige. Espionage Resources is generally depicted as being less competent and more corrupt overall than the Network.</li><li> American Teens Against Crime, or ATAC (pronounced "attack"), in <em>Undercover Brothers</em> is a government agency co-founded by Fenton Hardy that solely employs teenagers from around the country as their field agents, with the premise that there are some places where kids would blend in much better while investigating undercover than adults would. Frank and Joe were the first two recruits (thus how this series got its name), and are investigating ATAC cases in almost every book; as such, unlike the other series in the franchise, they are not amateur detectives in this one, and instead are official agents. They receive high-tech spy gear related to their cases in most books, and often reference having received extensive field training in a wide variety of different subjects.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>: Especially in the <em>Casefiles</em> books when they are almost always have to fend for themselves to outwit their enemies. Frank in particular can be a very efficient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmaster</a>, but even Joe can pull a few tricks of his own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler">Guttural Growler</a>: Croaker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> from the <em>Casefiles</em> book "The Number File", is described as having a grating voice which provides the source of his nickname.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead">Hard Head</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">Tap on the Head</a>: Frank &amp; Joe have been knocked out by getting hit in the head so often that, in real life, the two should be vegetables in permanent comas in the hospital. In the books, though, they just wake up with a bad headache or, at worst, a mild concussion. It's lampshaded in "The Number File"; the boys' car gets forced off the road into the ocean, and once they're safe, Joe quips about losing brain cells from hitting the windshield.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">Have a Gay Old Time</a>: Done intentionally by the most prolific of the authors, as a way of injecting humor into a job he didn't care for much.

However, since the first four books of the <em>Casefiles</em> all have Frank and Joe contacting or working with the Network in some form, they are essentially inducted as unofficial members of the agency, and thus future installments featuring the Network mostly drop the connection with Fenton in favor of working with the boys directly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>:<ul><li> Brothers though they may be, Frank and Joe also have this relationship in ALL of their different incarnations. Though their personalities change in the various series, one thing that is constant throughout is that they're a team and are inseparable, doing just about everything together and basically able to read each other's minds. They have their friends, and they have their girlfriends/love interests, but each of them is always the other's number-one priority.</li><li> They also have this relationship with Chet in pretty much every continuity, too.

Joe and Bess have one as well, but how strong it is and how they act on it varies widely between books.</li><li> In the second Super Mysteries, Frank definitely has a crush on Nancy, but it's unrequited due to her only having eyes for Ned (though she sometimes does flirt with Frank a little). Joe is also interested in her in the first book, but mostly goes for Bess in subsequent volumes (possibly since he knows Frank likes Nancy), though it never actually goes anywhere.</li><li> In their <em>Adventures</em>/<em>Nancy Drew Diaries</em> crossover, Joe still likes Bess, but since Nancy still has Ned, the story opts for a one-sided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Pair the Spares</a> by giving Frank a crush on George.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>: Both boys (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead">Hard Head</a>), but particularly Joe, who takes more punishment due to him being the more "athletic" one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMeddlingKidsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMeddlingKidsAreUseless">The Meddling Kids Are Useless</a>: Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, due to the fact that in the early books, the Hardy brothers would often find out who did what, but at the same time the police were doing the same.

This was later changed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleNarrativeModes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleNarrativeModes">Multiple Narrative Modes</a>: For the series as a whole:<ul><li> The originals and <em>Casefiles</em> are told in third-person, with the narrative mostly describing the events, actions, and thoughts/feelings of Frank and Joe, but occasionally showing those of other characters as well (especially in the early <em>Casefiles</em> novels).</li><li> The <em>Undercover Brothers</em> and <em>Adventures</em> are told in first-person, exclusively from the Hardy Boys' point of view, with Frank and Joe alternating first-person chapters.<ul><li> There are two <em>UB</em> books that contain the multiple modes within the book: the first Super Mystery ("Wanted") has the prologue and epilogue described in third person (and acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a>, with quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a> between the two), and "The Children of the Lost" has the prologue in third person from the point of view of an escaped kidnap victim.

They literally have <em>nothing</em> on their prime suspect, the coach of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingSportsTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingSportsTeam">Opposing Sports Team</a>, who was also pegged responsible for the disappearance of other fencers over the years. But then that coach decided to "scout" Frank as well, kidnapping him and taking him to an underground fighting ring. Frank proceeds to rescue his teammate, and between his work from the inside and Joe's search for him, the boys successfully bring down the whole operation. (It should be further noted that the coach <em>knew</em> of the brothers' detective skills, yet he thought that Frank would be easily swayed by money and fame to keep things under wraps.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">Not Allowed to Grow Up</a>: Joe is 17, Frank is 18. However, they're growing up slowly. In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, Joe was 15 and Frank 16, in the 50s through 70s blue hardbacks, Joe was 16 and Frank was 17. Still, that's nearly a century for 2 years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">Not Me This Time</a>:<ul><li> A heroic variant: in one story, the Hardys get pulled over because the cops received an anonymous tip from the bad guys, who set them up.

The police, knowing the boys wouldn't get themselves involved in the crime, instead ask them to what extent they helped their father solve it. Frank and Joe make it clear that they never even helped Fenton at all.</li><li> in &#147;The Mystery of the Desert Giant&#148; the brothers ask the captured criminals whether a pair of freight thieves they had a brief run in with earlier were part of their gang and are given a negative answer. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32xjx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note32xjx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32xjx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is unusual for the original series, where even petty crooks seeming irrelevant to the main plot would usually show as part of the main villains gang later on. </span></li><li> In the Supermysteries book &#147;Buried in Time&#148; the brothers think that the culprit from their case killed the victim from Nancy&#146;s case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">stumbling across some incriminating information.</a> When they accuse him of this murder though it turns out that not only didn&#146;t he kill the murdered archeologist, but he&#146;d never even <em>heard</em> of the man until that point (although he says if the guy really did have that information then it&#146;s a lucky coincidence that someone else did kill the professor).</li><li> Standard fare in the second half of the &#147;Undercover Brothers&#148; stories which have multiple mysteries involving the same characters. Frank and Joe will catch someone who confesses to some of the activity but denies being responsible for something else right after being proven truthful by a fresh act of sabotage, or threatening message.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKiddo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKiddo">Not Now, Kiddo</a>: The Hardys met with this in a lot of the early books.

Given he's Walter Rawley, an old friend of the family's, the brothers are skeptical. They keep it up, finding some evidence after Linda is kidnapped. Eventually, Frank goes missing as well, while Joe works with a detective who's been hunting Walter for a while to rescue Linda. It's then revealed that Linda and her sons were using Frank and Joe to make it look like Walter was the bad guy so they had an excuse for killing him in "self-defense" and get his fortune, and the "detective" is Linda's real husband and Greg and Mike's dad. Frank then reappears and turns the tables, explaining that he was struck mid-way through on how easy and obvious the case was shaping up, since they'd "never had to do so little work" to solve a mystery. He tried "flipping it around" to consider Walter the innocent one and the rest of his family guilty, and realized how much more sense that made.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">Painting the Medium</a>: <em>Casefiles</em> opens right after Iola is murdered by a car bomb.

For one example: in the Digest story "Farming Fear", Chet's and Iola's grandparents note at the end that they probably could have put the pieces together and solved the mystery some time ago if they'd been on better terms with their neighbor (given that their antagonistic relationship kept them from comparing notes and realizing they were both being sabotaged by the villain).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prospector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prospector">Prospector</a>:<ul><li> Bart Dawson and his mining partners (along with a few other old timers still hanging around town) were this in the backstory of both versions of "Hunting for Hidden Gold", digging a fortune in gold out of the ground before an attack by thieves forced Dawson to flee with the gold, causing an injury that gave him amnesia after he hid it, and before he could regroup with the others.</li><li> Lucky Moeller in "The Alaskan Adventure" is an older man whose spent decades panning the occasional gold nugget out of the Yukon without ever striking it rich, and has befriended the local bear. Moeller has given up hopes of getting rich panning gold by the events of the novel, and instead hopes to have his gold panning site serve as a tourist attraction for a theme park arriving in the area, and work as a guide until he earns enough money to retire to Florida.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>:<ul><li> Some of the Hardy's circle of friends have slowly faded away as time has gone by. Chet is still a regular; Biff Hooper, Tony Prito, and Phil Cohen appear reasonably frequently, though certainly not in every book; but Jerry Gilroy and Perry "Slim" Robinson completely disappear even before the end of the original 58 books, and don't show up even in the Digests.</li><li> In <em>Undercover Brothers</em> and <em>Adventures</em>, Chet is the <em>only</em> male friend of theirs from the original books who still appears; all the others are never name-dropped even once. Callie here as well; she makes one appearance in an earlier book of the former series before dropping out, and hasn't yet appeared at all in the latter series. Even Iola, who still appears, is no longer Joe's girlfriend; she's simply a friend of both brothers, as was Callie for her sole <em>UB</em> appearance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE">Recycled IN SPACE!</a>: The 1969 animated show featured the Hardy Boys...as a hip groovy <em>rock band</em>!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a>:<ul><li> Mike Moran in "The Firebird Rocket" went undercover with the bad guys on behalf of the U.S. Government.</li><li> Plenty of <em>Casefiles</em> henchmen (particularly if it's a woman who seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a>) turn out to be Network, CIA, or Interpol agents. "Road Pirates" also has Jackson, a sleazy member of the carjacking ring, trying to set up the gang to be caught by his brother-in-law (a state trooper) due to worrying that someone will get killed if they keep it up and apparently suspecting they won't just let him quit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayingTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayingTooMuch">Saying Too Much</a>: In "The Billion Dollar Ransom", the President's main kidnapper accidentally lets slip the existence of a third, unknown conspirator in addition to himself and his known partner when talking about what he'll do with his split of the money, which Frank recognizes as one third of a billion, not one half.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">"Scooby-Doo" Hoax</a>:<ul><li> Prominent in the original Hardcover series, where the titles give it away ("The Phantom Freighter", "The Ghost of Skeleton Rock"), although some are more subtle about it (for example, "Secret Warning" deals with both the ghost of a pirate <em>and</em> an ancient curse revolving around a golden Pharaoh's head). Even the <em>Casefiles</em> managed to squeeze in a seemingly supernatural plot at least once ("Cliffhanger" sees a mountaineering expedition on Yeti's Tower being threatened by the creature from which the mountain got its name).</li><li> Actually averted in "The Hardy Boys Ghost Stories", which contains non-canon short-stories that are more openly supernatural. Similarly, the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> book "Haunted"&mdash;this series's take on the ghost stories&mdash;has seemingly played this straight at the end after uncovering the villains' plans, only for one last genuinely supernatural event to occur (the boys see the ghost of a girl whose death they were investigating).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a>: Done fairly often by villains, with varying degrees of success or originality.<ul><li> In the reprint of "The Secret of the Old Mill", Peters nervously takes his share of the money and runs shortly after the boys are captured, only to be picked up by the arriving police a little before his partners as a result.</li><li> In the reprint of "The Shore Road Mysery", most of the thugs try to make a run for it in the climax, but are stopped by the boys through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a>.</li><li> In "The Disappearing Floor", minor henchman Waxie does this not because of the authorities, but out of fear of his boss after he accidentally forgot to raise up the elevator/floor where the title came from, causing his boss a nasty fall and an injured leg. This action makes him one of the only henchmen in the series who doesn't get arrested, given that the police round up the gang shortly afterwards.</li><li> Sweeper and Green in "The Secret of Skull Mountain" are being kept from quitting by withholding their promised money and blackmail material, respectively. Fed up with this, they decide to leave anyway and crack their employers' safe to steal that money and evidence, but have the poor timing to be doing it at the same time the Hardy Boys are investigating the building.</li><li> In The <em>Casefiles</em> book "Tagged for Terror" Ted, a member of the baggage theft ring, goes on the run about halfway through the book as suspicions rise (although he is considerate enough to tell the guy whose being suspected of his crimes that he'll mail a confession once he gets away). The last chapter mentions that he was eventually captured not far from the border.</li><li> A non-villainous version comes from Bart in the <em>Casefiles</em> book "A Killing in the Market". As the office assistant of a person of interest in the case, he's assigned to serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Courier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Courier">Courier</a> to the Hardy Boys, but while he's trying to meet them, he aborts the meeting and makes a beeline out of there when he spots a couple of mooks who had beaten him up earlier.</li><li> Another non-villainous version comes from Nicole in "Bonfire Masquerade". The brothers and Nancy suspect her when they find a map of all of the burned down buildings in her house where she's nowhere to be found (and abruptly stopped bidding on a piece of property connected to a murder). What actually happened was that Nicole had come to suspect that her rival bidder was the arsonist and decided to stop bidding and get out of town before he decided she was a threat.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTeam">Sibling Team</a>: One of the most classic and famous examples in literature (and in general).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleLineOfDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleLineOfDescent">Single Line of Descent</a>: In <em>Night of the Werewolf,</em> legend has it that every seventh generation, a member of the Taber family turns into a werewolf.

Interestingly, they were both titled <em>Nancy Drew-Hardy Boys Supermysteries.</em> (Fans tag them '88 and '07 for the sake of avoiding confusion.)

While quite a few other team members and the assistant coach are part of the hazing gang, Jason himself is not; however, his dad turns out to be the ringleader, who started the hazing because he felt that the team wasn't good enough to win the games needed for his son to get a basketball scholarship for college, and was trying to force the weaker team members to become better players through threats, intimidation, and violence.

In the originals, said other characters were usually the boys' family (Fenton, Laura, Gertrude) or "chums" (Chet and others). However, in the <em>Casefiles</em> (especially the early <em>Casefiles</em>, where the POV switch happens much more often), we get the POV of all these people and more, including Callie Shaw (pretty frequently), a few of the one-shot characters from the novel, and even the bad guys.</li><li> The first-person <em>Undercover Brothers</em> and <em>Adventures</em> make this switch the norm, although only with Frank and Joe; the brothers alternate chapters, so the POV constantly switches back and forth between the two.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a>: Frank, who has a disturbingly deep knowledge of things like investigative technique, criminal profiling, and computer hacking for an eighteen-year old.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime">They Fight Crime!</a>: Two teenage brothers with very different personalities and appearances who can practically read each others' minds, have a famous detective for a father, and do a better job than the local police.

After a successful robbery, Carl Denny was laying low at an airshow (having hidden his loot in one of several identical planes) when the cops tracked him down. Denny hot-wired a plane, drove it through the display case and took off right there, escaping the police, but belatedly discovered that he'd taken the wrong plane and left his loot behind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyNotoriousCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyNotoriousCrime">Unintentionally Notorious Crime</a>: In one tie-in short story, while the murder of a police officer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot">who'd pulled over a getaway car to give them a speeding ticket</a> is serious enough in and of itself, when this dead cop is the police chief's nephew, that guarantees a <em>really</em> intense manhunt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnReveal">The Un-Reveal</a>: In the reprint of "The Secret Warning", it never is revealed which of the two ships was responsible for the collision that caused the sinking and killed several people. Divers trying to steal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> in the cargo hold try to distract everyone to their motives by stealing the nautical instruments which would prove who caused the collision, and no mention is made of them being recovered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a>:<ul><li> Not the Hardys themselves, but rather in relation to their friends. While numbers have never been explicitly stated, there are still conflicting accounts on what each character's age in relation to Frank and Joe's. (for example, in "Mystery of the Chinese Junk" only Frank and Tony are of legal age to take a boating license, yet in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffBabies">Spin-Off Babies</a> Clues Brothers, Tony's in the same grade as <em>Joe</em>.)</li><li> Unlike the originals and <em>Casefiles</em> (where the brothers' ages are stated at the beginning of every book), the <em>Undercover Brothers</em> and <em>Adventures</em> series never give the boys an exact age beyond being teens in mid-late high school.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WHAMEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WHAMEpisode">WHAM Episode</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment">Establishing Series Moment</a>: The first <em>Casefiles</em> book opens a few seconds after Iola has been blown up. This establishes that the series is going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where The Hell Is Bayport?</a>: The most you really get is that it's a coastal town in New England within driving distance of New York City. The earliest series implies New York state, where there's an actual Bayport in real life, however, later materials will say New Jersey and Massachusetts as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase">Working the Same Case</a>:<ul><li> Frank and Joe's investigations often end up coinciding with one their father is working on.</li><li> Most of the Supermysteries, but there are some exceptions like "Shock Waves", "Buried in Time", "Hollywood Horror" and "Spies and Lies", which have separate sets of villains (though, in all of these books, the brothers and Nancy still help each other catch both sets, and consider the possibilities that their cases may be connected at different points in at least two of those stories). No matter how different the two cases seemed to be, they would have their case tied together to Nancy's roughly two-thirds of the way through the book. "Operation: Titanic" is likely the crowner of this, as the Hardys and Nancy keep just barely missing meeting up with each other and there's very little book left when they finally do. There are some examples that don't even bother with the pretense of having two separate cases, wherein Nancy or the Hardys will outright ask for each others' help from the very start or relatively early on in the story. In those cases, one or the other of them will often become sidetracked by something seemingly unrelated, which will inevitably tie into the main case eventually.</li><li> This continues in the second Supermysteries series. Four of the six books&mdash;"Terror on Tour", "Danger Overseas", "Club Dread", and "Bonfire Masquerade"&mdash;have Nancy and her friends on vacation in the same place that Frank and Joe are working on an ATAC case, and happening to meet someone or stumble onto something directly tied to their case. One of the other two books, "Gold Medal Murder", does have their two cases turn out to be separate with different perpetrators, but since the two people they're helping are in a relationship with each other, there's a lot of overlap between them and both groups work together to solve both cases. The final book, "Stage Fright", has the Hardys directly calling Nancy in to help them since she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Identical Stranger</a> to the woman they're bodyguarding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessTreasureTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessTreasureTwist">Worthless Treasure Twist</a>: In the reprint of "The Secret Warning", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> subplot involves some local figures diving for some money aboard a sunk Nazi submarine (one of the treasure hunters was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of the sub, another man was among the U.S. Navy crew that sunk it) who at first are antagonists of the brothers but then save them from the <em>real</em> villains of the book. Unfortunately for them, it is then revealed that the money from the submarine is counterfeit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: The boys sometimes encounter female bad guys on their cases, and if said women try to hurt or kill them, they will fight back in order to save themselves. It's downplayed in the <em>Casefiles</em>, where they tend to go easier on villainesses they do have to get physical with than they do in similar situations with men. They hold back less in the later series.</li></ul><hr>
