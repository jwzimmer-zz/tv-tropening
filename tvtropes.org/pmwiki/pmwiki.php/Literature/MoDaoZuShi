In particular, Jiang Fengmian's generation was too caught up in their own problems to raise their children well or address the Wen clan's growing abuses. Their deaths forced a group of ill-prepared teenagers to clean up after their mess.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a>: China has quite the detailed naming system, and one of them involves addressing either family or someone they're really close to by a shortened version of their birth or courtesy name, which is prefixed with "A-". For example, there's "A-Xian" (Wei Wu<strong>xian</strong>), "A-Cheng" (Jiang <strong>Cheng</strong>), and "A-Li" (Jiang Yan<strong>li</strong>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>: A lot of tragedy could be traced back to a few people getting too ambitious and wanting to rule over the cultivation world, disturbing the peace and bringing strife in order to gain material power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a>: The novel constantly jumps back and forth between Wei Wuxian's current and previous lives.

When Su She accuses Wei Wuxian of being afraid of death, Wei Wuxian counters that fearing death is not the same as simply not wanting to die yet, much like how there's a difference with him not wanting to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leave Lan Wangji's embrace</span> and being afraid of doing such... before he retracts his statement by realizing that they're actually the same thing. Of course, he was trying to piss Su She off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>: "Thank you" and "I'm sorry", both of which are repeatedly echoed throughout the story.<ul><li> Wei Wuxian tells Jin Ling that these are two phrases everyone must learn to say.</li><li> They're the last words <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wen Qing</span> said to Wei Wuxian before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sacrificing herself to the Jin Clan</span>.</li><li> They're also the words that Lan Wangji never wants to hear from Wei Wuxian as whenever they exchanged those words, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they would always meet again under worse circumstances</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>: This happens often between cultivation clans in order to forge more political connections, increase one's standing, and so that the clan leaders would have an heir.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: The <em>manhua</em> is drawn by only one artist, although the art style goes through significant changes that are less of a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> and more of a deliberate choice on the artist's part. Initially, the <em>manhua</em> follows a grounded art style with an equally grounded and earthy coloring scheme, which soon becomes more shoujo-esque with much brighter colors when the <em>manhua</em> gets to the first flashback arc about Wei Wuxian studying in the Cloud Recesses. By the time the <em>manhua</em> starts covering the Yi City arc, the art style became a cross between the two.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>: Discussed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in the <em>Iron Hook</em> extra. After the juniors hear the entire story of the eponymous ghost, they agree that the blacksmith's wife (the Iron Hook's first victim) got her just desserts for killing him just because she was bored being married to him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>: Any clan leader is bound to know how to fight like a badass.

However, many cultivators think with this mindset <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, as to them there's no in-between between right and wrong.

In the epilogue, Wei Wuxian overhears a few men doing the same thing regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jin Guangyao</span>, the <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, after <em>his</em> death.</li><li> A meta-example involving the audio drama: in the trailer for the first season, the first spoken line was, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lan Zhan. You're really great.

Unfortunately, many of the characters are either too proud, stubborn, or moral to make a compromise, which is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">severe miscommunication kicks in...</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>:<ul><li> After Wei Wuxian got rescued from the Xuanwu Cave, he realized he lost the pouch Mianmian gave him and wondered where it went.

Lan Wangji even lampshades the play on words. Then in the epilogue, after their run-in into a now grown-up and married Mianmian, Lan Wangji calls Wei Wuxian "Wei Yuandao" out of jealousy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfPrettyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfPrettyBoys">Cast Full of Pretty Boys</a>: Only <em>six</em> out of <em>thirty-two</em> named characters are female, and most of the men, even the older ones (Lan Qiren) are noted to be rather handsome.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag">Casting Gag</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShaPoLangNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShaPoLangNovel">This isn't the first time</a> Zhang Jie voiced a main character in a <em>danmei</em> novel adaptation who's infamous for his flute-playing (although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreadfulMusician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreadfulMusician">reasons differ</a>) and is feared in the battlefield. Bonus points since in the same adaptation, Guo Haoran played a major supporting character who serves as the former's closest friend and has his hands full dealing with him, except that they never fell out and remained as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> throughout; and Yang Tianxiang played the bastard son of an emperor, although his character was readily accepted into the royal family after his lineage was revealed to him, in contrast to Jin Guangyao, who didn't have it nearly as easy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a>: One of the core messages of <em>Mo Dao Zu Shi</em> is that what is right and wrong doesn't automatically equate to what is acceptable and unacceptable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster">Cerebus Rollercoaster</a>: One of the most egregious examples in modern fiction. What is an otherwise lighthearted story of adventuring is overshadowed by the overarching plot of finding and piecing together parts of a dismembered body scattered all over northern alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">Imperial China</a>. For example, the novel <em>literally</em> jumps from investigating a mass murder of a whole clan, to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lan Wangji getting drunk</span> in the space of two chapters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangedMyMindKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangedMyMindKid">Changed My Mind, Kid</a>: An inversion in that it's the kids who changed their minds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> During the Second Siege, Wei Wuxian decides to use <em>himself</em> as bait to give all the other cultivators enough time to escape the Burial Mounds unharmed.</span> The juniors are told to leave as well; but they decide to go back and help anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharactersDroppingLikeFlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharactersDroppingLikeFlies">Characters Dropping Like Flies</a>: Compared to her previous work, the author doesn't hold anything back this time around, with the first chapter even starting with the statement that the protagonist is dead. By the time of the finale, it's easier to count the characters who survived than those who kicked the bucket.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">Cheaters Never Prosper</a>: When the Sunshot Campaign was still oingoing, Jiang Yanli helped deliver food and would occasionally bring soup in secret to Jin Zixuan. In an attempt to earn merits, another female servant pretended to be caught red-handed by Jin Zixuan, who made her a guest disciple as a reward for her "efforts". But when Jiang Yanli is caught doing the same thing and is accused for taking false credit and Wei Wuxian hears of him, he quickly resolves the issue by calling for the female servant and exposing her lies. Besides Jin Zixuan getting beaten black and blue, there's no mention of what happened to the servant afterwards, however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a>: One of the tragedies of the Sunshot Campaign was how so many of the main characters were forced to become soldiers and generals at an incredibly young age (Wei Wuxian's generation was 16-20 years old). Wei Wuxian's so protective of children because he wants to preserve their innocence, having lost his in the war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">Children Are Innocent</a>: In contrast to the generation before them, the younger cultivators aren't involved in anything involving either the Sunshot Campaign or the First Siege, and anything they know about it is simply from word of mouth of their predecessors. Because of this, they don't share their parents' flaws of ambition and prejudice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseVampire">Chinese Vampire</a>: The really tall thresholds at the entrances and exits of ancient Chinese coffin homes (like a morgue, except storing corpses in coffins and all) is meant to prevent them from getting out. As Wei Wuxian explains, when the corpse is animated by natural energy, the body is still undergoing <em>rigor mortis</em>, so it can only hop, and it becomes difficult to hop over the threshold. So it hops, it trips, and it falls and stays on the ground until daybreak, where it could be discovered...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassTrip">Class Trip</a>:<ul><li> The Yi City involves Wei Wuxian and a bunch of younger-generation disciples of multiple clans messing about in an empty zombie-filled city, learning about corpse poisoning and how to cure it, how to look at ghosts, a practical use of dark magic, and mundane-people methods of warding against the supernatural threats. It's basically an impromptu class-trip cum internship.</li><li> This is repeated later in the <em>Iron Hook</em> extra, with the juniors actually <em>taking notes for future reference</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour">Code of Honour</a>: Most clans have a code of etiquette and honor that its disciples are expected to follow.<ul><li> No other clan matches the Lan Clan for scope: they carve all their rules on the giant Wall of Discipline at the entrance of the Cloud Recesses. In his time studying there, Wei Wuxian noted that there were three thousand-plus rules crammed onto the wall. In the thirteen years since he died, a thousand more were added; the audio drama even stated that the exact number is <em>4,019</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">Color-Coded for Your Convenience</a>: The five most prominent cultivation clans are easily distinguishable by the colors they wear.<ul><li> Gusu Lan Clan: Light blue and white.</li><li> Yunmeng Jiang Clan: Purple and black.</li><li> Lanling Jin Clan: Yellow and orange.</li><li> Qinghe Nie Clan: Dark green and olive.</li><li> Qishan Wen Clan: Red and white.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">Compressed Adaptation</a>:<ul><li> The <em>manhua</em>, similar to the audio drama, closely follows the narrative of the novel; but it also skimps on a lot of details from the novel that the audio drama was able to include or expand on.</li><li> The <em>donghua</em> also condenses some plot points at times, particularly during the flashbacks which detail what happened to Wei Wuxian after the Sunshot Campaign ended.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror">Conditioned to Accept Horror</a>: Reconstructed. For the cultivators, this is more or less a must. As Wei Wuxian puts it best: ghosts use their appearance to scare people because it affects the people's consciousness in such a way that it becomes a lot easier to suck out their energy, and as such they're a lot weaker when faced against those who show no fear towards them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">Conveniently an Orphan</a>: It's probably easier to list the characters in the main cast without dead parents.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictedByPublicOpinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictedByPublicOpinion">Convicted by Public Opinion</a>: Aside from ambition and miscommunication, another major source of conflict in the story is mob mentality.

After Wei Wuxian discovered it, many followed in his footsteps because demonic cultivation makes use of resentful energy, which is both readily available and abundant around all of China, and doesn't require the caster to cultivate a golden core (which requires plenty of time and effort). While there are some people who use demonic cultivation for sinister purposes, demonic cultivation isn't necessarily evil; and while dangerous, it can be used for good.

Also, Wei Wuxian's name has been cleared of the charges he's falsely accused of, and since he's now <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the partner of a cultivator <em>nobody</em> would dare speak up against</span>, they're at least guaranteed to be unable to backtalk him again and expect to gain anything from it.<ul><li> However, there are a few other exceptions in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">they don't die but don't get off scot-free either</a>. For example, there's Jiang Cheng and Lan Xichen &mdash; who were undoubtedly and voluntarily involved in the aforementioned events.

Everyone turned a deaf ear and overruled their statements, but the two both ended up coming out on top compared to everyone else. Lan Wangji, through his own merit and by distancing himself from politics as much as possible, becomes one of the most renowned living cultivators and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ends up getting married to the love of his life</span>; and Mianmian, by leaving her clan and becoming a rogue cultivator, gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> and has a loving family of her own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a>: By the time the final arc ends, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> four of the five main cultivation families are killed off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacialRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacialRemnant">with the exception of one surviving member</a>: Jiang Cheng for the Jiang Clan, Nie Huaisang for the Nie Clan, Jin Ling for the Jin Clan (not counting any other possible illegitimate children Jin Guangshan may have had who are still alive), and Lan Sizhui/Wen Yuan for the Wen Clan</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheTwoLovebirdsAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheTwoLovebirdsAlone">Leave the Two Lovebirds Alone</a>: This occurs in the aftermath of the Second Siege arc.

Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">Imperial China</a>, everyone expects sons to inherit from fathers and continue the family line.

Thus, they can support something one moment and then decry it the next, painting them as hypocrites. This contrasts with the protagonists, who may have flaws but are always loyal to their principles and care more about doing the right thing than being a hero. Wei Wuxian lampshades the trope best when he confronts the other clans just when they were planning to ambush him.<div class="indent"><strong>Wei Wuxian</strong>: If he wanted to to kill me, he didn't have to think about whether it was a fatal blow or not, and if I died, it'd be my own bad luck.

When a conflict rises or tragedy strikes, most of the characters tend to shift the blame onto someone who isn't clearly guilty (namely Wei Wuxian), because either they're unable to admit that either they're at fault or nobody was really at fault, they need someone to vent out their anger on, or they're finding an opportunity to castigate or justify their hatred for someone they're ready to point the finger at.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">New Powers as the Plot Demands</a>: Because of the plot's setup, it can seem like Wei Wuxian has new abilities out of nowhere. However, from a purely chronological point of view, Wei Wuxian actually lost his abilities along with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his golden core</span>, and then spent three months without a weapon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">the Burial Mounds</a>, so what we see as new powers is actually a lot of improvisation done on the spot based on half-remembered theory.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">Non-Malicious Monster</a>: Not every supernatural being is a threat, as sometimes there are spirits born from virtue instead of resentment.

From Jiang Cheng's perspective, there's the knowledge of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> what Wei Wuxian had sacrificed for him and why he broke his promise and the subsequent guilt he feels; he sees that Wei Wuxian is now happy and content by Lan Wangji's side and decides not to intrude on that; and he believes that there's nothing more to say between them</span>.<div class="indent"><strong>Wei Wuxian</strong>: Right now, I do really think... it's all in the past.

Some characters' names sound the same when written in romanized form, but not when written in the original Chinese characters. Such names that serve as examples are Ziyuan (from the Yu and Mo families) and Yuan (from the Lan and Wen Clans). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The latter is revealed to be a bit of subversion as Wen Yuan and Lan Yuan/Sizhui refer to the same person.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>: It's noticed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> that most cultivators only take the night-hunts where they would receive either a hefty sum or a boost in reputation.

Every main and supporting character who has a name has a unique and distinctive appearance; although the nameless background characters look like cut-and-paste versions of each other.

However, if one is steadfast in their loyalty to a person who has proven to be worthy of their trust, both are eventually able to overcome their difficulties and face against any odds together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerSource" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerSource">Power Source</a>: A golden core (<em>jindan</em>) serves as this for the cultivators. It is what gives them the ability to cast spells, battle ghosts, and fly on their swords; as well as enhancing their physical strength and endurance. Once a golden core is fully cultivated, the holder completely stops aging and essentially reaches immortality. However, cultivators are not <em>born</em> with one and must form it by training through various cultivation stages (five in common <em>xianxia</em> lore) before the golden core reaches its final stage of formation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>: There's a Cornetto commercial (with the characters promoting said ice cream brand) in almost every episode.

Wei Wuxian saved the lives of all the cultivators that conspired to murder him again, his name is cleared of the many crimes he's falsely accused of with the Jin Clan being revealed to be the ones who are actually responsible for them.

One of Jiang Cheng's greatest drives is to prove himself to everyone, although his circumstances and overall personality caused that drive to earn him a great deal of grief.</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Wrath</strong>: Pride aside, Jiang Cheng is also extremely vindictive. His short temper causes him to get narrow-minded and have difficulty seeing the bigger picture or empathize with others, and he's capable of holding onto his hate towards someone for a very long time. There's his hatred for the Wens, which &mdash; while mostly justified &mdash; made him unable to tell apart the guilty and the innocent; and more notably, there's his resentment towards Wei Wuxian, which is one of the core conflicts of the story for a good reason.</li><li> <strong>Envy</strong>:<ul><li> Jiang Cheng has self-worth issues from being constantly overshadowed by Wei Wuxian, and the Jin Clan takes advantage of this, as previously mentioned in the Pride section.</li><li> Jin Guangshan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> branded Wei Wuxian as an enemy because he wanted his power of controlling corpses to advance his plans of taking over the cultivation world</span>.</li><li> Jin Guangyao reveals that this is the <em>real</em> reason the cultivation clans turned on Wei Wuxian, not because they fear that he's turning evil &mdash; that's just their excuse. At a young age, Wei Wuxian had founded a completely new path of cultivation and consequently achieved so much in such a short time, and he had the aid of a young clan leader also achieved a lot in only a few months despite his clan being razed to almost nothing by the Wen Clan. None of the other clans, big or small &mdash; as they had been fighting for who gets the biggest shares from the aftermath of the Sunshot Campaign's &mdash; liked the prospect of such youngsters gaining a huge advantage, especially since one of them isn't noble-born, and the cultivation world is extremely classist.</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Greed</strong>:<ul><li> Jin Guangshan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shared Wen Ruohan's goals of ruling over China, but was more low-key about it and only started making his move after the Sunshot Campaign ended. His ambition caused him to target Wei Wuxian, whose powers are both a threat and an asset, and while he succeeded in instigating the First Siege</span>, he never got to see the day when he would be crowned Chief Cultivator.</li><li> Likewise, due to his past <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jin Guangyao is driven to climb the ranks of the cultivation world, and he'll do anything and everything to achieve that</span>. However, power that's earned through blood and trickery is only going to last for so long and in the end he loses <em>everything</em>, including his own life.</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Sloth</strong>: It would be difficult to associate just one character with this vice. With the exception of the protagonists and a few supporting characters, the rest of the cast are guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">Bystander Syndrome</a> for different reasons.

This ends up causing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the downfall of him and his clan in the long run, since one of his illegitimate sons decides to kill him, whereas another is used as as a vessel to bring back the person he had set to wipe out</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot">Sexy Discretion Shot</a>: In the audio drama, any time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji are about to have sex</span>, the scene segues to a music track.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: The protagonist gets pushed down into an abyss where they gain both immense power and a dark personality change. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RenZhaFanPaiZiJiuXiTong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RenZhaFanPaiZiJiuXiTong">Sounds familiar, doesn't it?</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">Sibling Yin-Yang</a>: Most of the sibling pairs serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foils</a> to each other.<ul><li> Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli take after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady">mother</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">father</a>, respectively.</li><li> Lan Wangji is stoic and aloof while Lan Xichen is a genuinely open and nice person.</li><li> Wen Qing is direct and fierce, in contrast to Wen Ning who is quiet and nervous.</li><li> Nie Mingjue is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> warrior who prefers fighting to poetry and politics while Nie Huaisang is weak at cultivation, prefers gentlemanly pursuits and is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> more cunning and better at politics.

Jin Zixuan is the only legitimate son of Jin Guangshan. Despite his arrogant exterior, he's honorable and kind once you get to know him.

Cultivators try to strive to be beyond base and material concerns but they ignore that at their own peril and the most honorable and powerful cultivators often end up crushed by reality. The novel lands somewhere in the middle. While it is good to strive to be virtuous, one must keep in mind that not everyone is and that no matter how powerful you are, cultivation power and justice cannot solve everything. So one must always keep an eye on the mundane world and understand and recognize evil at least enough to avoid its traps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyIsToBlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyIsToBlame">Society Is to Blame</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Wen Ruohan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Jin Guangshan</a> aside, <em>Mo Dao Zu Shi</em> is blunt about how another villainous force that drives most of the plot is society itself. Cultivators and non-cultivators alike treat others differently depending on their social status, do anything solely for their own personal profit even if it comes at the detriment of the well-being of others, easily look the other way at any injustice as long as it doesn't involve them, and are quick to paint anyone as a public and/or political target because of either envy, pride, spite, or sheer sadism.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>: Downplayed.

Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji are wise enough to stay out of the big clans' business and stick to either helping the little people or assisting the juniors in their night-hunts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>: In one of the flashbacks, after Lan Wangji <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">steals Wei Wuxian's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss">First Kiss</a></span>, Wei Wuxian (who was blindfolded, and thus didn't see who it was) comes across Lan Wangji, who is lierally punching trees out of romantic/sexual frustration - or, in other words, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">beating wood</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalRepellent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalRepellent">Supernatural Repellent</a>: The <em>Iron Hook</em> extra shows that salt is also effective in holding off ghosts or beings of resentful energy in general.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Sword Beam</a>: Cultivators can create these by sending spiritual energy through their swords.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamerAndChaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamerAndChaster">Tamer and Chaster</a>: The animated adaptation tones down a lot of the overt eroticism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">gorn</a> from the novel, due to Chinese censorship regulations.

Part of the problem is that as heirs and sons of the major clans, anything they do reflects on their clan which at best damages their reputation and at worst brings disaster as the clans bear the consequences of their actions. The fact that the characters are so young means that they lack to experience and wisdom to successfully balance these concerns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a>: In this story, any character who is kind and selfless is guaranteed to die in a horrible way, as was the case with the likes of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Xiao Xingchen and Jiang Yanli</span>.<ul><li> Ironically, Wei Wuxian's first death could be seen as this, albeit not by anybody in-universe.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance">Tragic Bromance</a>:<ul><li> Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan's friendship is the epitome of this trope.

Eventually, Xue Yang gets killed, leaving Song Lan free to roam the earth with his friend's soul and weapon</span>, and only time will tell whether they'll reunite once again.</li><li> While Wei Wuxian came back to life, his complicated relationship with Jiang Cheng still qualifies. Their relationship always had some tension due to Jiang Cheng's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> towards Wei Wuxian, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his parents' deaths</span> was only the first of many events &mdash; alongside a ton of miscommunication &mdash; that would cause them to turn from friends to enemies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the finale, they're no longer enemies, but at best they're still strangers who aren't talking to each other</span>.</li><li> There's also the Venerated Triad (Lan Xichen, Nie Mingjue, and Jin Guangyao).

However, <em>Mo Dao Zu Shi</em> is remarkably toned down on the degree of fantasy involved here &mdash; for example, most fantastic creatures still adhere to some idea of biology as commonly understood by the ancient Chinese, and walking corpses can be differentiated from living corpses because the latter still breathe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouOweMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouOweMe">You Owe Me</a>: Comes in tandem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">I Owe You My Life</a>. A recurring theme in the novel is debts, and both the positive and negative aspects of these tropes are explored. Anyone who is helped by someone naturally wants to help their benefactor/savior in return. Sometimes, this helps either side in the long run when they need it most or when they least expect it. Other times, this can damage a relationship when said relationship can easily be summed up with the questions "How much do you owe me?", "How much/little have you done for me?", and/or "How much have you wronged me?".</li></ul></div><p></p><hr>
