While the period is described (quite aptly) as France's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a>, there is a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">ham</a> involved.</p><p>The story begins in 1314, during the reign of Philippe the Fair. He is an effective king, if not well-loved, and has three sons. But his sons are being cuckolded: two of his daughters-in-law are sleeping around, with the help of the third. Of course, the Iron King's greatest accomplishment has been dismantling the Knights Templar, a task which took most of his reign up until now... but as the order's last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, is burnt at the stake, he shouts out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCestMoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCestMoi">Kings of France</a> shall be cursed unto the thirteenth generation.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Creepily, the next Kings of France had notably horrible reigns. Particularly, Philippe had three surviving sons, but <em>all</em> of them inherited the throne, and the sole issue any of them had sired by this point had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">her</a> legitimacy thrown into question by the whole daughters-in-law-sleeping-around thing. Those accursed kings form the primary focus of the novel.</p><p>The B-plot concerns Robert D'Artois and his attempts to (re)gain his father's county, which his aunt has cheated him of. Since that aunt is the mother of two of the daughters-in-law, he gets drawn into the main plot to the point where it can hardly even be called secondary.</p><p>The series has been adapted for television twice, in 1972 and in 2005, both only covering the first six books.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R.
