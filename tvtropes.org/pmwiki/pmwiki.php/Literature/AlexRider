Meanwhile, Scorpia's credibility does not survive being beaten by a 14-year-old boy on so many occasions, and the organisation eventually disbands because it has simply become a laughing stock.</li><li> The FBI attempts to take a page out of MI6 by sending their own teenage agent on a mission with predictable results as the boy they sent doesn't have Alex's skills.</li><li> The first time Alex tries to tell Sabina the truth about his double life, she thinks he's joking. The second time, in the aftermath of Damian Cray's attempted assassination of her father, she accuses him of being a fantasist and attempts to break off all contact with him, and it is only when Cray abducts her to blackmail Alex that she realises he was telling the truth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>: In the first six books, all of Smithers' gadgets end up coming in handy at some point, even if some of them seem to be so specialised it is hard to imagine Alex ever needing them. In the last three books of the original run, Horowitz seemingly deliberately introduces gadgets that end up not being used at all, even if they seem useful; the camera-jamming calculator in <em>Crocodile Tears</em> has a communication device built in that would be perfect for the second half of the book when Alex is kidnapped by McCain, were it not for the fact that he forgets to bring it with him. More interestingly, one of the gadgets in <em>Snakehead</em> appears to be this at first, as it is confiscated by Major Yu when he captures Alex. However, the fact that it was confiscated and his other gadgets left alone proves to be an important plot point.<ul><li> In <em>Scorpia Rising</em>, <em>all</em> of the gadgets end up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a>, as they are designed by Smithers so Alex can spy on Gunter at the CICAE, which is itself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> designed to lure Alex out to Cairo. They disappear from the narrative entirely once Alex and Jack have been captured by Razim. The sole exception is the one Alex uses to break into Gunter's office (which is not given to him with the rest when Smithers first arrives, but sent later when Alex asks him for help), as the fact that Alex would do that (and find the photographs which lead him to the secret passage in the Grand Hall) was apparently not anticipated.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hand</a>: All but two novels have one.<ul><li> <em>Stormbreaker</em> has Mr. Grin, who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowSmile">Glasgow Smile</a>.</li><li> <em>Skeleton Key</em> has Conrad, who is probably the most extreme example on the list.

Three books later in <em>Eagle Strike</em>, Alex decides that whatever Yassen is planning is not his business, but changes his mind when he realises that Yassen had been hired to assassinate Sabina's father.<ul><li> Alex expressly refuses to work for MI6 again in <em>Nightshade</em>, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he changes his mind when Mrs Jones reveals her personal connection to the eponymous organisation.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenegadeRussian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenegadeRussian">Renegade Russian</a>:<ul><li> Yassen Gregorovich, a contract killer who appears in <em>Stormbreaker</em> and <em>Eagle Strike</em>.</li><li> General Alexei Sarov, a disillusioned former Soviet general who wants his country back.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>: Conrad, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> of <em>Skeleton Key</em>, is said to have been blown up by a bomb <em>whilst he was carrying it</em> and surgically put back together. Horowitz seems to have later decided this was too extreme to be credible (especially given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a> nature of the series), as the <em>Mission Files</em> tie-in book altered it to a bomb in the boot of his car detonating whilst he was driving it to an army base he was planning to plant it in. Horowitz also seems to think that Dr Grief's name was a little too on-the-nose, as the same book reveals his real name is Johannes de Leede.<ul><li> In "Never Say Die", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it is revealed Jack's death was a fabrication of Razim's, and the film of her death Alex was shown was edited, then played to Alex to make it <em>look like</em> it was happening live.

This causes the plane to drive directly into a swamp while attempting to take off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!</a>: In <em>Point Blanc</em>, Smithers gives Alex an exploding ear-stud, and in <em>Skeleton Key</em> a flash grenade disguised as a keyring and bubblegum which will expand to enormous sizes when chewed. All of these are in direct contravention of his instructions from Alan Blunt, who does not want Alex to have anything that could be classed as a weapon, and all three are directly responsible for saving Alex's life. In <em>Eagle Strike</em>, upon hearing Alex is going off on his own after MI6 fail to take him seriously over Damian Cray, Smithers gives sends him a specially modified bicycle with about a dozen different gadgets hidden in it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNumberSnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNumberSnarl">Sequel Number Snarl</a>: Due to debate about whether or not <em>Russian Roulette</em> and <em>Secret Weapon</em> should be counted in the series' numbering, the forthcoming <em>Nightshade</em> has been variously described as the eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth book in the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">Series Continuity Error</a>: Perhaps as a result of being the first entry in the series after a long hiatus, <em>Never Say Die</em> contains several of these: the characters of Wolf and Fox are conflated, and their previous meeting is referred to as when Alex took on "the gang known as Snakehead", when &mdash; as the original book made clear &mdash; a snakehead is a <em>type</em> of gang. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> at the end also mentions that MI6's captive is currently being held hostage at the secret facility on Gibraltar from <em>Scorpia Rising</em>, even though at the end of that book Mrs Jones decided to shut the facility down, although the short timeframe of the series means it is possible it just hasn't been closed down yet. (The first of these was corrected when the book was reprinted.)<ul><li> <em>Russian Roulette</em> directly contradicts what is revealed about Yassen in the main series multiple times, as the book leaves nowhere that the operation in Mdina described by Ash in <em>Snakehead</em> can possibly take place, and also reveals that Yassen was aware that John Rider was secretly a double agent, which <em>Eagle Strike</em> suggests he never knew.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a>: Alex. He's been shot at, forced to watch people die, and stood face-to-face with pure evil. To add insult to injury, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jack is killed, and he is forced to shoot a person who looks just like him</span>. All this has profoundly psychologically damaged him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>: The author often goes into unnecessary amounts of detail, most frequently to describe the model of gun that a soldier/guard/assassin is using or the amount of litres per hour the engine of a vehicle uses. It makes the mistakes stand out a lot.<ul><li> Anthony Horowitz does a great deal of research to get specifics right; he notes that the only things he's been unable to do are visit space and go on board <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction">Spy Fiction</a>: Mostly Martini flavour, but with a strong Stale Beer after-taste. While it revels in the outward trappings of a Martini (exotic locales with adventurous activities, disfigured villains with ludicrously evil schemes, and high-tech gadgetry), Alex himself is frequently shaken by the moral implications of his work and quickly develops an extremely cynical and gloomy attitude about it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>: Alan Blunt.

Anthony Horowitz has likely noticed this, because in the ninth book two of the three villains are revealed nonchalantly without even bothering to surprise the reader. Also, did anyone else notice that Alex tends to always beat the grownups in some game, then they try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfDisproportionateResponse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfDisproportionateResponse">kill him?</a><ul><li> However, later books in the series deliberately try and change certain parts of the formula, or move them around; for example, <em>Eagle Strike</em> is based around Alex going rogue after MI6 refuse to believe him when he comes to them rather than vice-versa, the seeming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Ark Angel</em> turns out to be a decoy created by the <em>true</em> villain of the piece.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>: Several of Alex's gadgets; Smithers notes when giving him the exploding pens in <em>Crocodile Tears</em> that he "likes his explosions".<ul><li> Lots of explosions in the books.

More recently this has changed to the original tagline for <em>Stormbreaker</em>, <em>"Alex Rider - you're never too young to die"</em>. Several other books in the series have had their own taglines too:<ul><li> <em>Point Blanc</em> has had at least three, used on various different editions; early reprints used <em>"Alex Rider - we need you again"</em> (where the original just used <em>"From the author of the bestselling Stormbreaker"</em>), although the audiobook used <em>"I cannot be killed, Alex - the world is already mine..."</em>, and later versions used <em>"High in the Alps, death waits for Alex Rider"</em>.</li><li> <em>Skeleton Key</em>: <em>"Alex Rider's in deep water"</em> (used on certain reprints, replacing <em>"The thrilling sequel to Point Blanc"</em>)</li><li> <em>Eagle Strike</em>: <em>"Alex Rider has 90 minutes to save the world"</em></li><li> <em>Scorpia</em>: <em>"Once bitten, twice as deadly.
