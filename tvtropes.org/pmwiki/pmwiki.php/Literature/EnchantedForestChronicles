However there are some ordinary-named characters like Jack, Herman, and Rachel. The "normal"-sounding names are all given to characters spoofing familiar fairy-tale characters: Jack for Jack and the Beanstalk (where a married pair of giants have been repeatedly robbed by human men uniformly named Jack), Herman for Rumplestiltskin (who didn't <em>want</em> to keep people's children and changed his name so that it would be easier to remember or guess), and Rachel for Rapunzel (who let down her <em>chair</em> to people who somehow got the words mangled up).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>: Averted by the protagonists, who learn from their experiences - for instance, in "Utensile Strength", it's stated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">a wizard once stole something out of the armory</a>, which caused no end of trouble; since that mess was straightened out, Mendanbar has put up spells that prevent magic from being used too close to the armory (including his and Daystar's means of magical transport).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWitchesHaveCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWitchesHaveCats">All Witches Have Cats</a>:<ul><li> Morwen owns nine cats, and it's explained that the more cats a witch has, the more power she can channel.</li><li> Fire-witches also have cats - Brandel's is Horatio, who begins a romance with Morwen's cat Scorn. Seventeen years later, Morwen gives Shiara a kitten, whom she names Nightwitch.</li><li> Arona Michaelear Grinogion Vamist is of the belief that "proper" witches have one black cat each, and anything else (like Morwen's having many, none of them black) goes against tradition and is therefore wrong.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>: The King of the Enchanted Forest inherits a link to the magical forces that sustain the realm, which is more than enough power to be a match for any individual spellcaster (though you still run into trouble with groups).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: The Sword of the Enchanted Forest: powerful magical weapon, chooser of the heir to the kingdom... also good for plumbing. On the other hand, the sword leaks magical energy if you try to take it out of the Forest, and every magic user except its wielder can tell. Keeping it in a scabbard helps, but any time it's unsheathed or used, it's like sending out a homing signal for any magic-users.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">Back-to-Back Badasses</a>: One version of the cover art for <em>Searching</em> shows Mendanbar and Cimorene as such (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">although they were fighting a bit of a distance away from each other in the actual story</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">Bad Powers, Bad People</a>:<ul><li> Wizards absorb magic from everything around them, unlike witches and magicians who study magic and use magical objects. It seems as if only an unscrupulous person would <em>want</em> to be a wizard in this universe, since the magic absorption process visibly harms sentient creatures and damages the environment.</li><li> In <em>Talking to Dragons</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after the battle, it is mentioned that a few of the wizards surrendered and were willing to cooperate with the allies of the Enchanted Forest. Although, their alternative was being eaten by dragons.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a>: Sleeves, technically; Morwen's enchanted her sleeves to work like a backpack, although there are limits to the spell, at which point her sleeves get heavy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a>: Quite a few.<ul><li> Woraug as a result of being a traitor finds himself turned into a toad, for "not behaving like a dragon". It's hinted that the toad that Cimorene met who told her about how to find dragons was a former dragon for this reason.</li><li> During the wedding preparations at the end of <em>Searching For Dragons</em>, Mendanbar and Telemain go over Fire-Flower Meadow to make sure all the fire-flowers are gone and to deal with any lingering enchantments. They find and disenchant two princesses who've been turned into pinks (a species of flower), a frog prince and a hedgehog who'd once been someone's groom, and then invite all of them to the wedding once they're cured.</li><li> In <em>Calling on Dragons</em>, Killer is hit with multiple ones that <em>stack</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They're eventually transferred to Arona Michaelear Grinogion Vamist.</span></li><li> The Frying Pan of Doom when the rightful owner wields it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in this case a princess whose uncle tries to kidnap her in full view of a dozen knights and kings</span>, its target <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets turned into an enormous poached egg.</span> This has the benefit of making everyone nearby lose their appetite.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouSay">Be Careful What You Say</a>: To the nth degree within the Enchanted Forest itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a>: Morwen and Telemain. Also Alianora and the Stone Prince in the first book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewitchedAmphibians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewitchedAmphibians">Bewitched Amphibians</a>:<ul><li> Subverted with the talking frog that Cimorene meets in <em>Dealing With Dragons</em>, though he's met a few who played it straight.</li><li> Later in <em>Dealing With Dragons</em>, Alianora tells Cimorene that she was afraid Antorell would work this on them if they annoyed him too much. Cimorene replies that she doesn't think he's a very good wizard, and that he probably couldn't manage anything worse than a squirrel.</li><li> A frog prince is among the lingering enchantments found in Fire-Flower Meadow near the end of <em>Searching For Dragons</em>.</li><li> Morwen is offended at the suggestion, although she considers doing it to Arona Vamist because he irritates her so much. Her cats encourage it as they want something to play with.</li><li> In "Utensile Strength", Mendanbar foils an evil sorcerer's attempt to turn a knight into a pollywog.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">Bigger on the Inside</a>: Morwen's house, which appears to consist of one room, but has a back door enchanted to lead to any of about a dozen different rooms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed with Suck</a>: The fact that Alianora <em>wasn't</em> cursed at her christening, despite the presence of an evil fairy who it is explained had a <em>wonderful</em> time at the christening party and was in too good a mood to bother, seems to have been the origin of so many problems in her life (most of them caused by her Aunt Emintrude, who keeps trying to force Alianora into fitting some sort of fairy tale archetype) that for years her family thought she might have been better <em>off</em> with a curse instead. On the other hand, Alianora <em>has</em> managed to accrue a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> blessings such as never having problems with her teeth, not to mention that her unconventionality has made her the only princess besides Cimorene herself who is neither a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a> nor an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Blob Monster</a>: The quozzel in <em>Talking to Dragons</em>, which looks like a four-foot mobile tower of blackberry jelly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a>: Most of the princesses and the princes too.

It gets to the point that they need a traitor, which they get from Woraug.</li><li> Arona Vamist goes out of his way to make himself hated by a group of notoriously temperamental people that can set things on fire with their minds. This might have been excusable in that he at least protected himself against their retribution by allying himself with wizards, but he continues his boneheaded streak by <em>literally</em> trying to invoke this trope by taking severe exception to the intellectual positions held by Kazul &mdash; not just <strong>a</strong> dragon, but the King of the Dragons!

Every prince who goes on a quest for the Water of Healing is told to use the tin one, but most of them think they know better and turn to stone until one with sense comes along and uses some of the water on them. This happens again and again; even the prince Cimorene gets the story from in <em>Dealing With Dragons</em>, who <em>explicitly</em> knew better, still gave in to the temptation to take the damn golden dipper off its hook to look at it... which is why he's "the stone prince".

Of the three main dragons whose caves were seen or had their status referenced, Kazul's is the tidiest (though Cimorene still winds up picking up a lot of stuff that's just lying around where it doesn't belong), the official vaults for the King of the Dragons were in even worse shape than Kazul's were when Cimorene first moved in, and Roxim's caves in particular are full of clutter to the point where he has a hard time finding anything and is visibly frustrated about it; Cimorene winds up having to help him find the item he's looking for. This is part of why they have princesses, to act as live-in maids and keep things clean and organized for them, and after seeing the abysmal state of Roxim's caves, Cimorene makes a mental note to find a nice princess for him who can handle the job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileMaze">Mobile Maze</a>: The forest constantly shifts itself about.

Even after marrying Mendanbar she sticks to it. Mendanbar himself dresses very casually, and hates formal occasions (which he calls stuffy and boring), canceling as many as he can get away with, much to his steward's dismay. At one point, another character chides him for it, saying he should at least wear the crown or else no one would know who he was.</li><li> Their son Daystar sticks to the trend, though in the beginning since he didn't <em>know</em> he was a prince.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>:<ul><li> Arona Michaelear Grinogian Vamist acts as one in <em>Calling on Dragons</em>, for some unfathomable reason.

None of the royal family cares for their behavior; in fact, when Princess Elyssa leaves to seek her fortune, her father tells her that he hoped "she would give the councillors one in the eye".

According to Morwen, spells are hard on cosmetic changes (which is why witches never color their hair) and he won't be able to re-dye it until the spell residue wears off, which will take about six weeks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>: Roxim is easily one of the kindest, friendliest and most rational dragons that Cimorene meets, reminding her of an elderly great-uncle of whom she's rather fond.

So Mendanbar tells the uncle that boarding school is the perfect solution, because it's a thing that's conventionally done by nasty people, that the nephew will hate, but won't actually do much harm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhNoNotAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhNoNotAgain">Oh, No...

The first book also subverts this with Alianora, who <em>tries</em> to be a proper princess but fails miserably in various ways (and it's mostly not her fault - aside from the spinning straw into linen thread thing).

There was further mention of Antorell having actually <em>courted</em> Cimorene, and that they were married only after the sword was stolen.

When all efforts to convince her parents and her unwanted fiance to break off the marriage didn't work, she ran away and took sanctuary with Kazul, only to find Therandil showing up to 'rescue' her, mainly because he feels culturally obliged to do so despite the fact that she's perfectly happy where she is. She eventually gets rid of him by convincing him to rescue and marry a different princess being held by another dragon. He sees nothing wrong with this, and becomes interested in this new princess after learning only four things about her: first name, name of her kingdom, hair color, and a description of her crown.

Cimorene is considered "difficult" by everyone in the castle she grew up in, because her practical mind lead her to wanting to do things that actually served a purpose and let her take care of herself. Subverted in <em>Searching for Dragons</em>, when Cimorene has just met Mendabar and tells him she thinks Kazul is trapped in the Enchanted Forest and is going to go search for her. Mendabar tells her she shouldn't do that, to which Cimorene angrily asks him if it's because he thinks it's improper behavior for a princess. He tells her no, it's because he's king of the forest and thus knows that it's an incredibly dangerous place, full of dangerous stuff she's probably never seen before, and plus as the close friend and assistant of the already-disappeared king of dragons, her getting lost or killed or enchanted would likely spark <em>massive</em> political problems between the dragons and the citizens of the forest, which is the very thing they're trying to avoid.

He's introduced making trouble for Morwen for having a garden that doesn't look sinister enough, not being an aged crone with a stoop, and having multiple non-black cats (which ticks off the cats who are in the room when he calls). He later insists to the King of Dragon's face that she's supposed to eat a princess, not ally with her. He's survived this kind of idiocy because the wizards found him a useful distraction and put a protection spell on him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>: The villains try to create one in at least two kingdoms.<ul><li> The Mountains of Morning are ruled by the King of the Dragons, but rather than their naming a chosen successor, all dragons of age gather at the Ford of Whispering Snakes and take a special test, to move Colin's Stone from the Ford to the Vanishing Mountain. The stone itself selects the King, giving off a faint vibration that gets stronger and stronger until the dragon either is forced to drop the Stone, be shaken to pieces, or not feel it at all; the one who doesn't feel it and thus makes the entire trip without dropping the Stone is the one who's named King. The wizards later kill the sitting King and use magic to manipulate the Stone so their chosen candidate will be able to carry it; he drops it as soon as the spell is broken, and the rightful King is able to take the throne.</li><li> The King of the Enchanted Forest is chosen by the family sword, which is linked directly to the Forest's magic; only blood members can use it, and only then if the air, earth and water of the Enchanted Forest, and the fire of the Sword itself, acknowledge them (Mendanbar notes at one point that the sword doesn't always choose the sitting King's oldest son, and considers himself lucky to have followed his father onto the throne) and thus let them directly use the Forest's magic. Family members who haven't been acknowledged (such as the King's wife) can hold the sword but not use it; non-family members can't even do that for more than a second or two (as Morwen discovers when she grabs hold of it to save Cimorene and it feels like she's grabbed the hot end of a poker). The wizards later try to seize the power of the sword and Forest, thinking that one of them can become King if the existing line of Kings is ended. They fail because they didn't realize Mendanbar had a son, who stops them and frees Mendanbar from his prison.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">Sufficiently Analyzed Magic</a>: Again, Telemain.

And in his defense, he didn't want to <em>use</em> the dipper, he just wanted to <em>look</em> at it- he was fully aware that the normal dipper was the correct option the entire time.</li><li> Shiara, plus a bunch of other people who happened by the evil Fire-witch's castle (possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em>).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">Talking Animal</a>: They're not uncommon. In particular there are witch's cats (who can only be heard by their witch, meaning the reader is only privy to their conversations in <em>Calling</em>), Killer the rabbit (also in <em>Calling</em>), and Suz the lizard in <em>Talking</em>. A few minor examples also exist, like the squirrel who directs Mendanbar to Morwen in <em>Searching</em> or the frog who sends Cimorene to the dragons in <em>Dealing</em>.<div class="indent"><strong>Cimorene</strong>: Are you an enchanted prince?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Talking Frog</strong>: No, but I've met a few, and picked up a few things.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>:<ul><li> <em>Killer</em>, who keeps eating things that transform him in some way.</li><li> Antorell could also count, given that by <em>Talking</em>, his attempts for revenge against Cimorene pretty much have consisted of him dramatically bursting into her house and screaming about how he'll get her, only for her to promptly melt him.</li><li> Arona Vamist could also count, seeing as he makes it his business to endlessly pester witches (both fire and regular) and dragons about the "proper" way they should behave. Granted he had the power of an entire group of wizards protecting him from the fire witches, but there's really no excuse for him to argue with Kazul over whether or not dragons eat princesses, especially since he had just lost said wizarding protection.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTourney">The Tourney</a>:<ul><li> This does not include a fight between a dragon and a knight, Daystar notices.</li><li> A real one is held in "Utensile Strength", intended to find the rightful wielder of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FryingPanOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FryingPanOfDoom">Frying Pan of Doom</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorBuddy">Translator Buddy</a>: In <em>Searching</em>, Mendanbar frequently winds up in the role of "translating" Telemain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magibabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magibabble">magibabble</a> into something more manageable.<div class="indent">"Actually, it is," Telemain said. "The Enchanted Forest is unique, magically speaking, and therefore the interface between the forest and the rest of the world is equally unique. Penetrating that interface requires a specific application." <br>"What's that mean, when it's at home?" said Jack. <br>"You need a special spell to get into the Enchanted Forest, because it's different from everywhere else," Mendanbar translated. <br>Telemain looked irritated. "That's what I just said."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss">True Love's Kiss</a>: Pulled by Daystar to bring Shiara back from being a stone statue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistedAnkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistedAnkle">Twisted Ankle</a>: Invoked by Cimorene during the period when princes keep trying to rescue her; she gains a period of respite by pretending to one would-be rescuer that she's sprained her ankle and is thus unable to negotiate the path down from the mountain until it heals. (The path is sufficiently narrow and treacherous that the traditional remedy of carrying her to safety is out of the question.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnEqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnEqualRites">Unequal Rites</a>:<ul><li> Nobody likes wizards (dragons and other inherently magical beasts are even allergic to them).</li><li> Wizards don't like fire-witches due to some rather dangerous interactions thanks to the incompatibility of their magics, and they also do not like the unique magic wielded by the king of the Enchanted Forest. (Mainly because it's so effective at stopping them.)</li><li> Sorceresses ended up a little too popular for their own good.</li><li> Magicians are usually seen as confusing.</li><li> Fire-witches are moody and unpredictable at <em>best</em>, but then you get to the worst of them...</li><li> Regular witches are careful to keep their scary reputation up (even though most of them seem to be nice enough) so they don't end up like the sorceresses.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unicorn">Unicorns</a>: ...are rather narcissistic. The title unicorn of "The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn" actually tries to force Princess Elyssa to stay with him as his handmaiden so she can spend her days "appreciating his beauty". By the end of the story, he does get a (different) princess to be his handmaiden, who turns out to be even more conceited than he is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedRescue">Unwanted Rescue</a>: Cimorene tells this to all of the princes that come to "rescue" her. When Mendenbar comes, she mentions that she's even threatened to duel the princes herself so that they'll go away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>: Any wizard can be melted (temporarily) with the simple application of soapy water with a little lemon juice. Later a spell is devised to have the same effect by simply pointing a finger and reciting a magic word.<div class="indent"> "Argelfraster!"</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>: Antorell. "Father will be so pleased."

He doesn't have any better luck with that, either</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a>: In-universe, this is Cimorene's reaction to the Stone Prince's story of how he became a walking, talking statue: despite <em>knowing</em> that he should use the tin dipper and not the golden one to draw water from the magic well, he couldn't resist taking the gold one down from its hook just to <em>look</em> at. (To be fair to the prince, he saved himself from being completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a> with some very quick thinking, which Cimorene also acknowledges, and is generally one of the smarter characters in that particular book.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Minor example in <em>Searching</em>. The princess Mendanbar meets in the woods, who is the first to inform him that there's a giant patch of the forest that's been reduced to ashes, is never mentioned again. Mendanbar never even tells anyone else that a completely unprepared young woman is wandering around the woods, let alone send someone to find her and make her go home; given the setting, she could have met any number of unpleasant fates. Of course, given that the forest is semi-sentient, it's also equally plausible that it sent her off without undue harm- ultimately, we don't know.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a>:<ul><li> Heck, they have a Traveling, Drinking, and Debating Society. And a men's auxiliary for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> contingent.</li><li> In <em>Searching for Dragons</em>, a princess in the Enchanted Forest tries to move Mendanbar with her story of how her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> banished her there. Mendanbar is not sympathetic, as he instantly suspects that the princess and the stepmother talked the entire thing over as a way for the princess to get a good marriage. His son Daystar is more susceptible when a princess tells him a similar story in <em>Talking to Dragons</em>; that time it turns out to be a plot to get Daystar's sword.</li><li> Averted by the stepmother in "The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn", who actually cares for her three stepdaughters and is annoyed that her husband's advisors keep trying to persuade her to turn them into swans or throw them out of the castle while their father is away. She <em>does</em> wind up sending her middle stepdaughter to work for an extremely unpleasant fellow queen... whom she hadn't met face-to-face in twenty-five years, and was unaware of her changed attitude. She was quite upset with said fellow queen, who was also an old friend, when she learned the truth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchClassic">Witch Classic</a>: Witches are portrayed as good, or at least not evil, although Morwen herself is slightly different from the more standard variety, which annoys her fellow witches who are more stalwart adherents to the trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Witch Species</a>: Fire Witches, although it's possible for them to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a> kids - just very unlikely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Youngest Child Wins</a>: Discussed. The stone prince was turned to stone while attempting a quest to obtain the magical cure for a king's illness; he tells Cimorene that in retrospect he ought to have realised that as two of the king's three sons had already attempted the quest and failed, nobody was going to succeed except the third son.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom">Your Mom</a>: At one point, Morwen's cats get in an argument with Grendel, the cat belonging to Archaniz (the Chairwitch of the Deadly Nightshade Gardening Club, and a friend of Morwen's). While Grendel's remarks aren't translated, Trouble makes use of this trope (plus a stealth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>) when he yells back at him:<div class="indent">"Oh yeah?
