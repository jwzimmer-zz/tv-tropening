A ninth book covering the tumultuous early period of that marriage, <em>The First Four Years</em>, was published posthumously.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Not counting <em>Farmer Boy,</em> the first three and a half books of the original eight chronicle the Ingallses' family life as they move from place to place on the American West frontier, partially to carve out a better life and partially to satisfy Pa's "itching foot." <em>Farmer Boy</em>, meanwhile, chronicles a year in the life of nine-year-old Almanzo (the same year his future wife was born), growing up and working hard on his family's prosperous farm near Malone, New York.</p><p>The last three and a half books are about the Ingalls family settling permanently in the brand-new town of De Smet, Dakota Territory, as Ma has finally put her foot down and demanded that her girls receive a stable education. The Ingallses are also recovering from a bout of scarlet fever, which has left oldest daughter Mary blind. These books focus in on Laura's life as she grows up and struggles to find ways to help her parents survive on the harsh frontier, while also exploring life away from home. Oh, and falling in love with Almanzo, who has also just arrived in De Smet and is now ambitious for his own farm.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There is some contention about how much of the books are purely Laura Ingalls Wilder: the stories are hers, to be sure, but her daughter Rose Wilder Lane was a popular author and was instrumental encouraging her mother to publish her story. While Laura already had a background writing columns for local newspapers, some suggest Rose&mdash;who was an accomplished ghostwriter&mdash;wrote the books herself, while others suggest she merely offered advice and put Laura in touch with her publishing connections; the truth is likely somewhere between the two extremes. A study of the relevant correspondence between the two suggests that Rose's main concern was with the technical details of grammar and style, while her mother focused on character and plot. <em>The First Four Years</em>, which was written without Rose's help, is noticeably different in style to the rest of the series, but this may have more to do with the fact that it was apparently originally intended as a more adult take on the same material.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>After Wilder's death, her daughter found her journal account of their move from De Smet to Mansfield, Missouri, and had it published as <em>On the Way Home.</em> Shortly after Rose's death, her lawyer and heir, Roger Lea MacBride, brought to light <em>The First Four Years</em>, which Rose had entrusted him with. MacBride also published a collection of letters Laura wrote to Almanzo while visiting Rose in San Francisco during the World's Fair, under the title <em>West From Home.</em> Not content to stop there, he also wrote a series of books about Rose, drawing on stories she told him as a child and tossing in a few creative liberties.</p><p>HarperCollins was similarly discontented, as they smelled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">zombie franchise</a> in the making - nearly half a century later! - and added to the Rose books, publishing an inter-generational <em>Little House</em> series about Laura's female ancestors:</p><ul><li> <em>The Rose Years</em> by Roger Lea MacBride</li><li> <em>The Caroline Years</em> by Maria D. Wilkes and Celia Wilkins about Caroline Quiner Ingalls, Laura's mother.</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCharlotteYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCharlotteYears">The Charlotte Years</a></em> by Melissa Wiley about Charlotte Tucker Quiner, Laura's grandmother.</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMarthaYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMarthaYears">The Martha Years</a></em> by Melissa Wiley about Martha Morse Tucker, Laura's great-grandmother.</li></ul><p>HarperCollins also published books about Mary Ingalls and Nellie Oleson, and <em>Old Town in the Green Groves,</em> a book about the "lost years" Laura felt were too painful to include in children's books, written by Cynthia Rylant.</p><p>These extra books vary in quality and success at emulating the charm of the originals, but all are interesting portraits of "America's favorite pioneer family."</p><p>Laura's autobiography Pioneer Girl, which she initially tried to publish before re-writing her life story as the Little House books, was published in October 2013.</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">television adaptation</a> began airing in 1974.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> adapted <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em> and <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> into a six-part miniseries in 2005. Carrie was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> of the story.</p><hr><h2>Tropes relating to Laura's books, and their companions, sequels, prequels, ad nauseam:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>: Eliza Jane Wilder does terribly as a teacher in <em>Little Town on the Prairie.</em> Nellie is the only student that likes her, but every other student is dead set against her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>:<ul><li> Ida Brown and Laura's nasty rhyme about Eliza Jane goes viral with the boys in their class. Laura and Ida feel guilty about it, and Pa and Ma are unimpressed, but the boys have a blast singing it.</li><li> Laura's reaction when a kitten hides in her hoopskirts to hide from a dog, while sitting in church. Mary's stern with her at first - maintaining proper decorum, <em>especially</em> while in church, was very serious business - but when she hears the story even she has to admit it's amusing.</li><li> When the school board visits Miss Wilder's class to look into the escalating campaign of misbehavior, Pa mentions hearing that one of the boys, Charley, was punished for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThumbtackOnTheChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThumbtackOnTheChair">sitting on a bent pin</a>. The picture of innocence, Charley replies, "I was not punished for sitting on it, sir, but for getting up off it." Pa manages to keep a straight face, but the other two board members visibly struggle not to laugh.</li><li> Laura watches two drunks who are initially too dignified to step out of each other's way join hands, begin singing, and kick in all the screen doors in the town. When Royal Wilder tells them off, they begin singing "My name is Tay Pay Pryor and I'm Drunk". Ma and Mary are horrified by the story, but Pa clearly sympathizes with Laura for laughing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: Most notably Laura's brother Freddie, who died in infancy. Laura felt it was too sad to include his death in a work for children. Less notably, Almanzo had a third sister, also named Laura, who was likely Adapted Out because it might have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">confusing to have two characters with the same name</a>. (Almanzo also had a younger brother named Perley, who doesn't appear in <em>Farmer Boy</em> simply because he was born a few years after the events of that book.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>: <em>The Long Winter</em> has three or four chapters from Almanzo's point of view instead of Laura's, while <em>New Dawn on Rocky Ridge</em> has one chapter focusing on Laura instead of Rose...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADeathInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADeathInTheLimelight">A Death in the Limelight</a>: ...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Pa is dying and has requested that Laura come back to De Smet to say good-bye</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: There's a slew of them in <em>Plum Creek</em><ul><li> After grasshoppers devour what was supposed to be a plentiful crop, Pa has to <em>walk</em> 200 miles for a job. He's gone for weeks, and when they don't receive a letter from him, they worry that something may have happened to him. Fortunately they do eventually receive a letter, and he returns safely, but the thought of your parent, spouse, and family breadwinner perishing and leaving you with an uncertain future and loss of the family patriarch during those times was terrifying.</li><li> Pa goes to town right before a blizzard hits, and the girls are stuck snowed in, anxiously waiting his return and worrying that he may have gotten caught in the blizzard and froze to death. Thankfully, he returns safely then, too.</li><li> Before the blizzard itself hits, Pa mentions a story about parents who went into town and got trapped by a blizzard, with their children left back home. When they returned, they found that their children had burned the furniture to stay warm but had died of hypothermia anyway.</li><li> In <em>Farmer Boy</em>, the story of the robbers who broke in, tied the family up, and beat the father nearly to death. Especially since it nearly happened to the Wilder family themselves.</li><li> In <em>By the Shores of Silver Lake</em>, baby sister Grace gets lost on the prairie. To child readers, it's a somewhat tense scene. For grown-ups with children of their own, it's absolutely horrifying. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grace is found, in a perfect circle of violets. Laura is certain that it's a fairy ring, but grabs her little sister despite being creeped out. It turns out to be a buffalo wallow; the way buffalos roll in the dirt breaks up the prairie grass and aerates the soil perfectly to encourage the violets to grow.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: The Wilder siblings are named Royal, Eliza Jane, Alice, and Almanzo. The Rose books mention two others: youngest brother Perley and eldest sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">Laura</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a>:<ul><li> Laura calls Almanzo "Manly" after their marriage, and he calls her "Bess," for her middle name, Elizabeth. Partly this is due to Almanzo disliking his name and also having a sister named Laura, but it's sweet, too. Most of the girls also have pet names:</li><li> Laura is called "half pint<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ipjw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ipjw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ipjw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">of sweet cider half drunk up</span>" and "flutterbudget" by Pa.</li><li> Almanzo calls his daughter his "Prairie Rose," the flower she was named after.</li><li> Caroline was called "little brownbraid" by her father, which her brothers and her father's friend picked up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeAppropriateAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeAppropriateAngst">Age-Appropriate Angst</a>: In the first few books, when Laura is very young, what drama there is is about her and Mary's sibling rivalry and things on that level. The stakes get much higher as she grows up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance">Age-Gap Romance</a>: Downplayed (though featured) in most of the books themselves: in <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em>, Almanzo is supposedly 20 when he begins courting the 15-year-old Laura, which Ma initially objects to due to Laura's age. In <em>The First Four Years</em>, the text gives his real age; he's got a solid decade on his wife. In that time and place, such an age gap wasn't uncommon, but it was seen as somewhat skeevy by the time the books were written (especially given that Laura was a teenager).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed">Altar the Speed</a>: Laura and Almanzo decide to move up the date of their wedding drastically - so drastically that it's held in the minister's parlour and with no guests - because Eliza Jane and Mother Wilder are coming to out from Minnesota to plan a big church wedding neither bride nor groom can afford, plus the harvest season is coming up. When Ma Ingalls protests that they could at least have a small ceremony at the Ingalls home, Laura counters that it wouldn't be fair to have a ceremony purely for the benefit of her family and not give Almanzo's the chance to attend.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">Amazon Chaser</a>:<ul><li> Almanzo hints from time to time that part of the reason he likes Laura is her spirit and temper. While Laura spends her teenage years worrying about what people think of her because she sometimes plays ball at recess, Almanzo buys her a pony just for her playtime and later builds her a sled that their dog can pull. When Laura tells him that she isn't comfortable promising to obey him against her better judgment as part of their marriage vows, Almanzo tells her he didn't expect her to (and that he's never heard of any woman who actually keeps the vow even if she makes it, "nor any decent man that wanted her to"). What's mildly hilarious is that when he decides to court Laura, he doesn't bother informing her that that's what he's doing, presumably assuming she'd know. He clearly hasn't factored in the fact that she's <em>fifteen</em> and completely naive about men. This winds up backfiring on him for a time: when she does figure it out, she panics, and tells him that while she appreciates him driving her to and from her teaching job, she's not interested in anything more. Fortunately, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>, which pays off in the end.</li><li> There is also the time where a band of Indians came to inspect the Wilders' farm. One of them takes hold of Laura's arm, and she slaps him; the leader of the little band not only forestalls any violent response from the man, but promptly asks Laura to leave with him and be his wife.</li><li> There are also hints that Lew and Martha's romance was going to develop along these lines. In her third book she challenges him to a footrace - he's widely known for being the fastest runner in the valley - and Lew is clearly impressed and very complimentary when she almost beats him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>:<ul><li> Grace sometimes has moments of this, as she's so much younger than Mary, Laura and Carrie and is frankly a little spoiled because of it. It's not that common, however, and it's pretty much never intentional; it's more things like making a mess trying to "help" Laura clean.</li><li> In their adult years, Laura admits that she was sometimes this to Mary when they were young children.</li><li> Eliza Jane sees Almanzo as this, although it seems to be mostly her perception since he behaves similarly around his other older siblings (Royal and Alice) and they don't appear to have this opinion of him.</li><li> Martha is this occasionally to Grisie and, more rarely, to her brothers in the first prequel series.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>:<ul><li> "Everything is evened up in the end.

In a downright scary example, when the weather is at its coldest, Almanzo has to make frequent stops when taking Laura home from teaching school to melt the ice that forms from the condensation over the horses' mouths and nostrils, so they won't suffocate on their own breath.

Almanzo spends a few weeks dreading the whipping he'll get when the stain is discovered, but Eliza Jane hunts up some leftover wallpaper and secretly patches the stain to save him.</li><li> There's also something to be said for Eliza Jane being one of the main reasons why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed">Almanzo and Laura get married much earlier than planned</a>... because she wants to come to De Smet and throw them a big church wedding. Considering how she is an antagonist to Laura in <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em> and would have good reason to be unhappy with her brother's choice of a bride, her enthusiasm for the upcoming wedding shows how much she cares about her brother's happiness (albeit in a way that substitutes her own judgment for Laura and Almanzo's actual wishes on the matter).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">Badass Adorable</a>: Kitty, a kitten that the Ingalls adopt, who when only a few weeks old, kills a mouse much larger than her.

Now, let's say you are picking on kids whose father is an influential town member, and it leads to the rest of the class declaring war. How do you think he will not find out about it? Unsurprisingly, Eliza Jane leaves abruptly after the school board barges in on the disruption; even though Pa hears Laura's side of the story and learns she wasn't being arrogant while letting Miss Wilder off the hook, it's implied if he wanted to reprimand Eliza Jane, he could.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CabinFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CabinFever">Cabin Fever</a>: Inevitably, in <em>The Long Winter</em>, Laura starts to feel like she's going a little nuts at times.

A minor subplot in the background of the series is her mission to get all of the Wilders to live with her in Louisiana and try rice farming, which leads to Mother and Father Wilder visiting Rose and her parents, Father buying the house in Mansfield that they live in for a few years, and later, Father losing his fortune and dying of the shock. It culminates in Eliza Jane visiting Rose's family, and inviting Rose to live with her for a year and complete her education, as a way of atoning for the loss.

Laura grew up always on the edge of poverty and is frugal and practical almost to a fault, while Almanzo's family was always prosperous and successful and never wanted for much. They clash a bit after they're married, because Almanzo wants the family to have modern means and comforts but Laura hates spending money. Laura tells Manly in <em>The First Four Years</em> that she doesn't want to marry a farmer and wishes he'd get a job in town, despite her preference to live in the country, because it'd be more financially secure. The only time we really see them in a fight is in <em>Little Farm in the Ozarks</em>, when Almanzo buys Laura a new stove on credit. He's excited because it will make her work easier, because she can bake and cook at the same time, it's sturdier than they one they have and less likely to catch fire, and it's actually very lovely to look at, but while Laura is initially happy, she tells him to go back and return it because they can't afford it. They have a similar difference of opinion when Almanzo brings home a mail order catalogue, and when Laura finally gives up on saving for something in it, he sighs and complains, "Sometimes a fella just wants to spoil his best girl, but you won't hardly let me." Laura kisses him and tells him that he spoils her just fine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory">Coming-of-Age Story</a>:<ul><li> The entire series chronicles Laura's life from childhood to adulthood.</li><li> The prequels are coming of age stories for Martha, Charlotte and Caroline, though the first two series were never finished.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a>:<ul><li> Nellie Oleson. Laura apparently felt it would be in poor taste to name real people if she was portraying them in a negative light, and so three unpleasant girls Laura knew were rolled into one. And yes, one of them moved from Walnut Grove to De Smet. The descendants of the three girls remain distinctly unimpressed with how much Laura made up. Being a composite of three people is why Nellie Oleson seems to suffer a personality shift in every book in which she appears. The first, Nellie Owens, was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> similar to young Nellie in <em>Plum Creek.</em> The second, Genevieve Masters, was the snooty teen rival who complained about how much better things were Back East, similar to the Nellie in <em>Little Town</em>, and the third, Stella Gilbert, was a flighty ditz who briefly captured Almanzo's attention (he was also friends with her brother) until he learned she was frightened of horses, similar to Nellie in <em>These Happy Golden Years</em>.</li><li> Some researchers believe that Mr. Edwards, the "wildcat from Tennessee" who befriends the Ingalls family during their stay near Independence, Kansas in <em>Little House on the Prairie,</em> may be an amalgamated depiction of several different people who did kind deeds for the family throughout the years (in part because historians have been unable to find any records of a "Mr. Edwards", or of anyone who fully fits the bill).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstantlyLactatingCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstantlyLactatingCow">Constantly Lactating Cow</a>: Averted in the books, where the family's cow stops giving milk when the hard winter comes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumePorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumePorn">Costume Porn</a>: Several of the books contain detailed descriptions of the clothes that Laura and her mother made for her and her sisters.

Laura's memoir, <em>Pioneer Girl,</em> was her unabashed documentation of her childhood with her family. Her daughter, Rose, helped her edit and soften the story to make it into a children's story and make it more palatable to publishers. Her original account includes stories of domestic violence, murder, theft, rape, and adultery; it also makes mention of the family having to leave towns in the middle of the night after being unable to settle debts, Laura being hired out as a nanny to a family as a young teen (and almost being molested by a drunk man while staying with them), and the family staying in a hotel adjacent to a saloon with all manner of unsavory experiences that went along with that.

Eliza Jane needless to say is not pleased. By the time she pops up in the Rose series, she insists on being called "E.J." (Laura still calls her 'Eliza Jane' in her letters to Rose.

There are many stretches where the Ingallses are eating the same food at every meal for months. It's very noticeable how different the food in <em>Farmer Boy</em> is, not just in quantity but in variety.</li><li> There are also at least two lengthy passages describing harvest and butchering time, with detailed descriptions of preparing and storing up food in various ways &mdash; these are surprisingly engrossing.</li><li> The descriptions of chicken/blackbird pie in <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em>, baked beans and pumpkin pie for the town social, Ma creating a mock-apple pie from green pumpkins, fresh greens from the garden, and creamy cottage cheese with onions also make an appearance.

Although there is a larger age gap - eight years or so - like Laura, Martha was tomboyish, energetic and mischevious while Grisie was girly, quiet and passive. One can only imagine what would happen if the two pairs met up. The difference between Martha and Grisie is further emphasised by their choice of lifestyle. Grisie marries a rich, landowning friend of their father and settles down as a society wife. Martha emigrates to America with the village blacksmith to live the life of a commoner.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>: Most of the Little House girls and their husbands, despite the hardships of frontier life.

She topped out at five feet tall, which was short even by the standards of her day, and worries her students won't listen to her because she's so small. (Turns out she's right, but she handles it.) She also tells Almanzo that Pa never let her drive the wagon, because she's too little. Almanzo thinks that's ridiculous, and teaches her to drive anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>: In-story, Laura is surprised to realize that her gentle, ladylike mother hates sewing as much she does.

She's often mentioned as being "delicate", and suffers frequently from what sound like migraines. At one point she almost faints in school during an unjust punishment, prompting Laura to resent Eliza Jane even more. The fact that EJ picks on sickly little Carrie is what sends Laura over the edge, and makes her give up trying to get the other children to behave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit">Impractically Fancy Outfit</a>:<ul><li> More subtle than many examples, but for women, the fashions of the day were pretty impractical for frontier life. Working a farm in corsets, hoop skirts, and layers and layers of petticoats would have been much harder than it should have been. In <em>Farmer Boy</em>, Alice is explicitly mentioned as planting crops in her hoop skirts, and Laura has to wheedle to leave her corset off while helping Pa bring in the crops. Despite the fuss and trouble of fashion, though, everyone still wanted the latest styles from the east.</li><li> Later, when the family's settled down somewhat, Carrie admires how nice Laura looks in her long dresses and hoops and wishes allowed that she was old enough to wear them too. Meanwhile, she's saying this just as a strong wind has caused Laura's hoops to bunch up, forcing her to pause and spin around to untangle them. Laura tells her that being fashionable is a nuisance, but that when you're her age, you want to be fashionable.</li><li> In <em>Farmer Boy</em>, Mother is described as having to turn sideways before she can pass through a door because of her hoop skirts. And <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em> makes a point of the fact that hoop skirts are coming <em>back</em> into style. Yes. They got rid of hoop skirts <em>and then they came back.</em></li><li> In fact, there's a lot of fretting over Mary's college wardrobe, just in case hoops come back. There's also a moment of comic panic when Ma fears she's accidentally made Mary's bodice too small before Laura realizes that Mary's corset is looser than it was when they took her measurements. After tightening her corset, the bodice fits, and everyone heaves a sigh of relief (except for Mary, who can't).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a>: Laura, who gets her first teaching certificate at the age of fifteen, wonders if she's too young to be a capable teacher.

In the book, she is five years old.

Making it even funnier, it doesn't appear to have been an intentional attempt to get around the rule; Laura was just being a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Literal-Minded</a>.</li><li> In <em>Farmer Boy</em>, Royal gets Almanzo to agree to a bet that he and the men will have all the sheep sheared before Almanzo has the fleeces stored away in the barn loft. During the lunch break Almanzo sneaks an unshorn sheep up into the barn loft and wins the bet.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a>: All of the Little House girls. Although there's a lot of pragmatism mixed in, all the marriages are based on love. Martha particularly stands out, as during the missing time between the <em>Martha Years</em> and the <em>Charlotte Years</em> she fell in love with the local blacksmith instead of a wealthy land-owner as expected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">May&#150;December Romance</a>:<ul><li> A very mild example. In the books Laura shaved a few years off her and Almanzo's age gap&mdash;he was ten years her senior, meaning when he started courting her she was fifteen and he was twenty-five. That wouldn't have been seen as at all odd in the 1880s, when an age disparity in a couple might easily be twenty years, but by the time she wrote <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em> and <em>These Happy Golden Years</em> it would have been considered a little skeevy. (Though not so startling as, in <em>By the Shores of Silver Lake</em>, the story of a girl who was married at <em>thirteen</em>; even Laura and her friend Lena are shocked by that, as they're both nearly the same age.)</li><li> Almanzo's given age in the books varies wildly over the series, possibly to assuage readers over this very issue. In <em>The Long Winter</em> it's stated that he's under 21, the age one had to be to file a claim on a homestead. He tells Royal that he's "21 or as good as." (It's interesting that by the time she was writing the books, Laura-the-author preferred to have people think Almanzo was breaking the law than that he was ten years older.) Laura was about 14, making their age difference only 5-6 years. However, the 10-year age gap comes to light in <em>The First Four Years</em> when it's mentioned explicitly that when Laura turned 19, Almanzo turned 29.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayIBorrowACupOfSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayIBorrowACupOfSugar">May I Borrow a Cup of Sugar?</a>: In <em>The First Four Years</em>, Laura and Almanzo's nearest neighbor is described as an inveterate borrower who never gives anything back. At butchering time, he comes over when Almanzo's out to ask Laura, one by one, for all the necessary tools, and "grimly Laura said to herself if he came next to borrow their fat hog to kill she would let him have it. But he had a hog of his own."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher">Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher</a>: New schoolmarm Eliza Jane gives a speech on her first day about how she intends to rule by love, not fear: <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Laura and her friends find it embarrassing and don't think it will go over well when the older boys start coming to school... as it turns out, they're all too right. Not to mention that Eliza Jane devolves into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a> thanks to Nellie spreading gossip about Laura being arrogant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorningSickness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorningSickness">Morning Sickness</a>: Though the term itself is not used, Laura has horrible morning sickness with both her pregnancies, involving not just vomiting, but dizziness and fainting, which scares Almanzo enough to call the doctor. Despite that, she does what she can to take care of the homestead. With her second pregnancy, a neighbor brings her a big bag full of Walter Scott novels, and reading them in between her chores gets her through the worst of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCard">My Card</a>: The first time Laura and Almanzo properly speak to one another, they exchange name cards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a>: In-universe example - Laura and the rest of the students at her school find Miss Wilder's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher">overly cutesy speeches</a> trite and embarrassing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalStereotypes">National Stereotypes</a>: Occasionally.

In the Rose series, she brings her son to visit Rose, Laura, and Almanzo, and the narrative actually does a good job of balancing the fact that Laura and E.J. politely hate each other with Rose's admiration of her aunt. The thing that really frustrates Laura is that E.J. insists on helping with the housework, hustling and bustling and trying to make Laura's workload easier. She tries to deal with it, but Laura insists to Rose that two women cannot coexist in one house.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetHurts">Of Corset Hurts</a>: Laura is <em>not</em> fond of her corset; she describes it as "a sad affliction to her". She actually looks forward to the hard work of bringing in the crops, because it means she can leave it off. She also can't follow her mother's and sister's example &mdash; they both <em>sleep</em> in theirs, which she gives up on fairly early on. Carrie isn't too keen on the idea, either, and Laura tells her to be grateful to be without one while she has the chance.<ul><li> Going by her descriptions, it sounds as though they were all practicing tight-lacing, which was unhealthy, uncomfortable, and fortunately fairly uncommon. Ma was proud that Pa could "span her waist with his hands" when they were first married, and, as mentioned above, Mary was laced so tightly that her bodice was too small once the corset strings stretched. Laura's was tight enough that she was "tormented by the steels, which scarcely allowed her to draw breath." Properly-fitted, non-tightlaced corsets are far more comfortable, and were what the majority of women wore.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldNewBorrowedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldNewBorrowedAndBlue">Old, New, Borrowed and Blue</a>: When Ma Ingalls objects to Laura using her new black cashmere dress as her wedding dress, citing the saying "married in black, you'll wish yourself back," Laura cheerfully invokes this trope in response, saying she'll wear the dress with her old blue-lined bonnet and borrow Ma's gold brooch. Ma concedes that there is probably not much truth in such sayings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheBoys">One of the Boys</a>: Laura gets along well with the boys at school because she's willing to do things like play ball outside with them instead of staying primly indoors.

Almanzo's oldest sister was also left out of <em>Farmer Boy</em> so as to not confuse readers, since her name was <em>also</em> Laura &mdash; which is also why Almanzo called his wife "Bess" or "Bessie" (her middle name being Elizabeth).</li><li> Averted with one of Laura's classmates in De Smet, who is also named Mary. However, the narrative always refers to her by her full name (Mary Power), likely to prevent the character being confused with Laura's sister.</li><li> Averted briefly in <em>Big Woods</em>, where Laura runs into a cousin of hers at Grandma and Grandpa's sugaring off dance <em>also</em> named Laura Ingalls.

The Ingallses find him abrasive, and the hellfire tone of his sermons off-putting (it also doesn't help that he took a post they had hoped would go to their beloved reverend from Minnesota). But he's very against the use of the vow of a woman to 'obey' her husband in a marriage ceremony, to to the point that he's argued about it with people offscreen.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse">Pintsized Powerhouse</a>:<ul><li> Laura. Her small stature even as a child earns her the name "Half-Pint," but as a five-year-old, she's strong enough to drag a rocking chair containing both her sisters away from a fire, and she and Mary manage to bring an entire woodpile into the house during a blizzard. As a teen, she rips the bolts out of a bench that had been secured to the floor of her schoolhouse. On several occasions, Pa says she's "strong as a little French horse." She also has little trouble helping Pa with the harder parts of bringing in the harvest. Her strength also surprises Almanzo, when he starts teaching her to drive his buggy.</li><li> Martha. At the age of eight she challenges her friend Lew to a footrace and comes closer to beating him than any boy in the valley. (Bear in mind, Lew is the blacksmith's son who's already working in the forge and several years older than her). Later in the book she runs over three miles to get help to a sick tenant and her parents are amazed she made it so quickly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp">Plot-Relevant Age-Up</a>:<ul><li> The events of <em>Little House On The Prairie</em> actually took place when Laura was about four years old; in fact, much of what's depicted in <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em> actually took place after the Ingallses returned from Indian Territory. The characters were aged up in <em>Little House On The Prairie</em> to set it up as a sequel to <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em>.</li><li> Some elements of <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em> count as this as well, since the story also includes some events that took place before the family left for Indian Territory, when Laura was only three. Her age progression was partly to set up <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em> as a more unified story and partly because the publisher didn't think anyone would believe that Laura's memories at age three would be so vivid and accurate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Plucky Girl</a>: Most of the female characters; the 1880's frontier life tended to require it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prospector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prospector">Prospector</a>: One of Laura's uncles shows up one day with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDogStory">Shoot The Shaggy Dog Story</a> about going looking for gold in the Black Hills.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster">Pungeon Master</a>: Pa, slightly.

She also quits her own continuing education: when she tells Mr. Owen she's engaged and won't be coming back to school after her upcoming term as a teacher, he apologizes for not graduating her already&mdash; he was waiting to graduate her and her classmates all together the next term, and some of them weren't ready. Further reading about the author's actual life will show that, while she wasn't allowed to <em>teach</em> after marriage, she still did a variety of other jobs to supplement her husband's farm work during lean times, including dressmaking, writing, bookkeeping, boarding, and dispensing loans. It's specifically noted in <em>On the Way Home</em> and <em>Little House on Rocky Ridge</em> that the hundred dollar bill the Wilders have as a down payment for their new land was earned by Laura, working outside the home as a seamstress. It's also mentioned that Laura's mother, Caroline, was also a schoolteacher before she got married.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadishCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadishCure">Radish Cure</a>: In <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em>, Miss Wilder attempts to employ this trope by commanding Carrie Ingalls and her seatmate to put their books away and rock their desk as punishment for rocking it while studying. It's mostly an effort to get at Laura by picking on her little sister, and it backfires dramatically (and awesomely) when Miss Wilder demands that sickly little Carrie, abandoned by her seatmate, continue to rock the desk by herself&mdash;Laura declares that she'll rock the desk if Miss Wilder wants it rocked, and she proceeds to do just that, ripping the bolts right out of the floor and making so much of a racket that nobody in the entire schoolroom can hear the lesson.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a>:<ul><li> In <em>These Happy Golden Years</em>, Laura's hair is described as falling past her knees when it's loose. Ma also mentions that when she and Pa were first married, her hair was so long she could sit on the braids. At that point in time long hair was considered a defining trait of femininity, so most women grew it as much as they could, and rarely (if ever) cut it.</li><li> Pa cut Mary's hair short during her bout with scarlet fever (a common practice at the time, since it was thought that cutting off hair could reduce fever). Ma takes great pains to hide this when they're out in public.</li><li> In <em>These Happy Golden Years,</em> Cap Garland teases Mary Power by stealing her hairpins. Laura, who knows Mary's "beautiful large knot of hair" is fake and might fall off at any moment, rescues her by shoving some snow down the back of Cap's shirt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>:<ul><li> Pa in <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> illegally settled in Native American territory. He's convinced that as long as they don't argue with the locals, all should be good. That's not what happens; the government in a moment of goodwill forces the settlers off the land to honor the treaties.</li><li> Eliza Jane Wilder's last class ends in bedlam when the school board walks in, and she tries to defend herself by throwing Laura under the horse carriage, as it were, scapegoating her for the chaos. It doesn't work; the board fires her or she resigns from the disgrace of all the boys rebelling because they made the choice to undermine Ms. Wilder's authority. If you can't manage your students, as Laura notes in the next book, then you're not fit to be a teacher. Even though Ma and Pa tell Laura she needs to respect her teacher, they get her side of the story and admit that it wasn't her fault because Nellie decided to cause trouble.</li><li> Almanzo as a wedding present to Laura buys her a new house with many fancy fixings and supplies for cooking. She appreciates it. Come the next book, they're in heavy debt from all of the purchases. Laura lampshades it as she's calculating their losses. (This also helps to explain why she gets so upset in <em>The Rose Years</em> at Almanzo buying her a new stove.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit">Rebellious Spirit</a>: Martha, Laura and Rose.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">Red Oni, Blue Oni</a>: Laura is spunky and adventurous while Mary is quiet and well-mannered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegalRinglets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegalRinglets">Regal Ringlets</a>: "Nasty" Nellie Olson's hair, as shown in the famous Williams illustrations, is a classic example of this style.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeError">Relative Error</a>: Almanzo mistakes Laura's visiting uncle for a would-be suitor.

All of the books, especially <em>Farmer Boy</em>, make it clear just how much time and labor went into basic things like planting potatoes or cooking a meal in the pre-industrial days. Almanzo spends whole days plowing the fields, sunup to sundown, and he's maybe 10 years old!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan">Single Woman Seeks Good Man</a>: Most of the Little House girls, which is accurate for their time periods and Almanzo, Charles, Henry and Lew are all portrayed as good, hard-working men.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a>: Reverend Brown of De Smet, whose thundering, fear-based style is contrasted with Reverend Alden, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd">kind and quiet minister</a> from Walnut Grove. He holds a week of revival meetings at one point, and when the Ingallses go to one, they find it off-putting at best and leave before it's over.<div class="indent">For one horrible instant Laura imagined that Reverend Brown was the Devil. His eyes had fires in them.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedYoungLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedYoungLady">Spirited Young Lady</a>: Martha definitely qualifies as the daughter of a laird who prefers foot-racing to sewing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">Spot of Tea</a>: Pa is a tea rather than a coffee drinker.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>: Historically Martha and Lew. She was from well-off, land-owning society while he was a blacksmith. One of the few things actually known about Martha is that her family disapproved of her marrying someone below her station. The books were developing this before <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> ended the series.

They're both incredibly smart girls, but Mary is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Literal-Minded</a>, she's very serious, unsentimental, and unromantic, especially after she goes blind. Laura is friendlier and more imaginative. When she's seeing out loud for Mary, her descriptions are very poetic and evocative, but Mary often corrects her "queer notions," because what she's describing is impossible. Mary doesn't like metaphors, either, and Laura has to stop herself from using them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TextileWorkIsFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TextileWorkIsFeminine">Textile Work Is Feminine</a>:<ul><li> True to the clich&eacute;, tomboy Laura hates sewing and ladylike Mary has no problem with it.

Laura Ingalls Wilder, Maria D. Wilkes, Celia Wilkins, Melissa Wiley, and... Roger Lea MacBride? If you're looking for these books in a library, Rose's will probably be shelved a little ways off from the others. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a> was deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> by the publishers &mdash; when the Rose years gave bookstores and libraries fits over where to shelve them (as a sequel series, should they go by Laura's books? or should they go under "M"?), they specifically requested that the author of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMarthaYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMarthaYears">Martha and Charlotte years</a> take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaWiley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaWiley">penname beginning with "Wil-"</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar">This Means War!</a>: The boys in Laura's class when Eliza Jane sends Laura and Carrie home after the chair-rocking incident; they see the unfairness in the situation. Their subsequent campaign leads to the school board visiting the class, and Ms. Wilder leaving abruptly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a>: Eliza Jane Wilder, when you compare her character in <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em> to <em>Farmer Boy</em>. She goes from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a>, in part due to Nellie telling her that Laura was being arrogant and also in part to being new at teaching.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThumbtackOnTheChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThumbtackOnTheChair">Thumbtack on the Chair</a>: Invoked in <em>Little Town on the Prairie</em> as part of the campaign of misbehavior Laura's classmates stage in rebellion against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Miss Wilder</a>. One of the schoolboys plays the victim of a version of the prank involving a bent pin, leaping up out of his seat with a yelp; when Miss Wilder goes to hit his palm with her ruler as punishment for making a scene in class, she finds that her ruler is missing, and sends him to stand in the corner instead (where he stands humorously rubbing his backside).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl">Tomboy and Girly Girl</a>:<ul><li> Laura and Mary respectively, when they're little. Mary enjoys sewing and knitting, whereas Laura would much rather be outside, either playing or helping Pa. When neighbors come to visit in <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em>, Mary and the neighbor girl play nicely in the house, while Laura and the boy go climb trees. Laura becomes less of a tomboy as she grows up, but she never does learn to like sewing - although she took a lot of seamstressing jobs to help her family financially. In <em>The Rose Years</em>, whistling is mentioned as something Laura enjoys, though it's not considered very lady-like.</li><li> And again, Martha and Grisie, with the same outdoors vs knitting debate taking place a hundred years earlier.</li><li> Caroline and her sister Martha. One is neat, bookish, quiet, and is concerned with keeping her clothes pretty and not worn out looking; the other is boisterous, outdoorsy, and impulsive. That said, Martha pines after her future husband and settles as a housewife while Caroline goes to school and teaches before settling down with Charles Ingalls.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">Tomboy</a>: As mentioned above Laura and Martha.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueOnTheFlagpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueOnTheFlagpole">Tongue on the Flagpole</a>: During a cold snap in <em>Farmer Boy</em>, Almanzo muses that <em>some</em> kids are foolish enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">take the dare</a> to lick a pump handle, but he knows better.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeyComeHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeyComeHome">Tropey, Come Home</a>: In <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, Jack gets separated from the family when they cross a river that's stronger than Pa realized, and they think he's dead. He catches up with them that night.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>: Laura puts up a sharp front because she doesn't dare show much affection for Almanzo. This changes after he proves himself by saving the town... and she proves herself <em>extremely</em> handy at outmaneuvering her rival Nellie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">Uptown Girl</a>: Martha for Lew. She is part of the Scottish land-owning class while he is a working class blacksmith. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> above for more details.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a>:<ul><li> The books broadly parallel the courses of the various Ingalls' lives, but enough details are changed and rearranged to have the series firmly classified as fiction.</li><li> The prequels vary in their closeness to historical evidence. <em>The Caroline Years</em> are based on accounts of Caroline's childhood written by her older sister Martha to Laura so do include some personal insight.</li><li> <em>The Charlotte Years</em> work from a very rough framework of Charlotte's age/birth/death, her sibling's ages and names, the town she grew up in, her early job as a seamstress, a little about her husband and general events that happened in Roxbury at the time.</li><li> With <em>The Martha Years</em> literally all that is known is her birth and death date, that she was the daughter of a laird, she emigrated from Scotland, and the name of the blacksmith she married. Virtually everything is fictional.</li><li> <em>The Rose Years</em> were written by Rose's close friend and heir, based on stories she told him of her childhood, although he embellished events at times in order to portray Rose as the central hero. For example, in <em>Little House on Rocky Ridge,</em> after the Wilders lose the hundred dollar bill they saved as a down payment for their land, Rose finds it stuck in between the drawers of Laura's writing desk. In the afterward of <em>On the Way Home,</em> written by the historical Rose Wilder Lane, she talks about a dark period where they lost it, but Laura simply wakes her up one day to tell her they found it stuck in the desk.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternUnionMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternUnionMan">Western Union Man</a>:<ul><li> The telegraph is coming into town in the later books, and Laura goes to dinner at the operator's house. He demonstrates it for the guests, and they're fascinated. He also gets them all to hold hands in a circle and then gives them the first real electric shock of their lives.</li><li> Towards the end of "The Rose Years", Rose takes a job for the telegraph office.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood">Whip It Good</a>: A gang of rough older boys comes to Almanzo's school every winter to beat up the teacher and drive him away... until this year's model, small, soft-spoken Mr. Corse, literally drives them out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a>-style with a borrowed bullwhip.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YawnAndReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YawnAndReach">Yawn and Reach</a>: When Laura notes that the back of the seat of the buggy they're riding in is lower than normal, Almanzo rests his arm along the top so he's "not exactly hugging" her. She responds by shaking the whip to scare his colts so they start running and he has to use both hands to control them.</li></ul><hr>
