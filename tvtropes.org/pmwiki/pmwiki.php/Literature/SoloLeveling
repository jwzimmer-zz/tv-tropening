At the same time, some people awakened superhuman abilities. The awakened beings who can enter the gates, and hunt the monsters that are lurking inside, before they can break out into the human world, are called "hunters". One of these hunters is Sung Jin-woo, a 24-year-old E-rank hunter, who is mockingly called the "World's Weakest Hunter". Being barely stronger than the average human, Jin-woo struggled in the lowliest of dungeons to get by and provide for his family.</p><p>One day, however, things go awry for Jin-woo and his party when a low-level dungeon turns out to be far more dangerous than initially assumed. Alone, wounded and surrounded, Jin-woo faces his certain doom, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenGameInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenGameInterface">a voice suddenly appears</a> that offers to make Jin-woo a "player". Having nothing to lose, Jin-woo accepts and loses consciousness. After waking up in the hospital, he notices a quest log that only he can see, which uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse">RPG-like terms</a>. Soon after, he learns that unlike any other hunter, he can gain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">character levels</a> and improve rapidly by hunting monsters and training every day. This is the story of Jin-woo changing from the weakest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">the strongest hunter in the world</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Solo Leveling</em> (&#45208; &#54844;&#51088;&#47564; &#47112;&#48296;&#50629;, na honjaman lebel-eob, also known as <em>I Alone Level Up</em>) is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebSerialNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebSerialNovel">Web Serial Novel</a>, written by Chugong, which consists of 270 chapters and was collected into 14 volumes by Papyrus.</p><p>In 2018, a webcomic by Jang Sung-lak, and published by KakaoPage, started serializing.

In the novel, she first appears as the sole female hunter of the group that tags along with Yoo Jin-ho, while Jin-ho and Jin-woo clear the dungeons.</li><li> Hwang Dong-seok's younger brother, Dong-soo, already makes his first appearance in Chapter 24 in the webcomic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">right after his brother was killed by Jin-woo,</span> when he first appears in the novel after Jin-woo defeated Kang Tae-shik. He also comes to Korea after merely two weeks, when in the novel he is held off in the States for more than two months.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy">Adaptational Nice Guy</a>: Kim Sang-shik is given more background story about his family, and his struggle to apologize to Jin-woo, whom he left behind to save his own skin. He is still alive when Jin-woo finds him after Kang Tae-shik mortally wounded him, and he is given enough time to at least beg Jin-woo for forgiveness before dying. In the webcomic, Jin-woo is clearly shaken by Kim Sang-shik's death, while in the novel he merely coldly acknowledges his death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>:<ul><li> Jin-woo's first encounter with Ahn Sang-min of the <em>Baekho</em> guild is significantly shortened. In the novel, Ahn Sang-min trying to recruit Jin-woo and Jin-woo selling the rights to the C-rank gates Yoo Jin-ho reserved is split into two scenes.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> of the red gate incident, after Association employees screwed up the gate measuring, is not shown in the webcomic.</li><li> Yoo Jin-ho's family situation is not shown in the webcomic.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The webcomic adaptation adds parts that weren't originally in the web novel.<ul><li> There are more scenes with Song Chi-yeol shown right before he meets Jin-woo again, like him practicing swordsmanship at a dojo.</li><li> Kim Sang-shik's guilt for running away and his struggle to apologize to Jin-woo is shown.</li><li> The entire fight with Kang Tae-shik is, except for how it ended, different and expanded. Tae-shik plays around with a sword-wielding Song Chi-yeol for a bit before Jin-woo interferes. Furthermore, Jin-woo's tendons are cut after Tae-shik used Stealth only for Jin-woo to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfRecoverySurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfRecoverySurprise">Self-Recovery Surprise</a> by using his full recovery quest reward, when in the novel Jin-woo merely fakes panicking and reads Tae-shik's attack in time.</li><li> Hwank Dong-soo arrives in Korea in Chapter 47 of the webnovel, where he encounters Woo Jin-cheol. The two of them go to Jin-woo's location at the red gate, where they encounter Baek Yoon-ho, and Hwang Dong-soo provokes a short-lived fight.</li><li> The fight with the high orc sorcerer is less onesided in the Web Comic and while Jin-Woo is still far stronger than the sorcerer, his summons have a more difficult time handling his minions and the tide is only turned once Jin-Woo starts raising the high orcs he killed to fight against their own.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGuild">Adventure Guild</a>: The Hunter Association serves as a modern organization for hunters. They measure both the dungeons and the hunters' strength and sell the rights of gates to private raid parties and guilds. They also take in lower-ranked hunters (like Jin-woo at the beginning of the story) and assign them to raids that higher-ranked hunters don't want to partake in before a dungeon break occurs. While larger guilds receive a lot of benefits from the Association, the Association also mandates them to take care of certain dungeons if an emergency occurs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopEnforcer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopEnforcer">Aesop Enforcer</a>: When Jin-woo is attacked by Hwang Dong-seok's raid force, he is taken aback that the System tries to punish him if he doesn't kill them. When he is hit by a spell, the System goes even further and outright tells him that it will <em>kill</em> Jin-woo if he doesn't comply. Since that quest, Jin-woo has stopped hesitating to kill when he has to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">Acrofatic</a>: Vulcan, the 50th floor boss in the Demon Castle Dungeon is very large and fat, yet can easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>: When a gate first opens, only humans can pass through, but if the dungeon inside isn't cleared within a week, the monsters inside will be able to use the gate to invade the human world. And all of them are compelled to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">Aliens Speaking English</a>:<ul><li> A perspective flip happens when Jin-woo <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes through the red gate with newer members of the White Tiger guild. He encounters ice elves who refer to the humans as garbage, which Jin-woo takes offense to. The ice elves are shocked by a human speaking their language. It turns out the System auto-translates speech between Jin-woo and any intelligent monsters.</span></li><li> The <em>Hunters</em> raid force is very confused when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the boss of the dungeon, Kargargan,</span> suddenly starts speaking Korean to them.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The ant king's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalismSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalismSuperpower">Cannibalism Superpower</a> allows it to talk after eating Min Byung-goo's head.

Not even Iron can speak, despite originally being human.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan">All According to Plan</a>: This is what Jin-woo thinks when he deliberately faked his panic and "barely" blocked Kang Tae-shik's Stealth attack. He wanted Tae-shik to show enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingIntent">Killing Intent</a>, so that the System will give him an emergency quest (and thus a reward for killing Tae-shik).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: Jin-woo is consequently this, as he gets far stronger than his official E-rank implies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At least until he reevaluates his rank, and the Hunter Association officially declares him to be South Korea's tenth S-rank hunter.</span></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Amplifier Artifact</a>: Some companies can forge items that will amplify a mage hunter's power. The best items that can be produced amplify magic by 50%, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so the Hunter Auction House is dumbfounded when Jin-woo presents to them the Marble of Avarice, which <em>doubles</em> the output.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>: Those who arise involuntarily as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jin-woo's shadow minions are bent to his will.

Jin-woo says that he's doing it because he wants to kill the monsters and clear the dungeons, which catches Go Gun-hee completely off-guard.
