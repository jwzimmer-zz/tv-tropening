The main character of the story is a young boy named Kip, an orphan from a backwater village in a war-torn country who is suddenly thrust into an increasingly dangerous series of events upon learning that his father is actually the Prism&mdash;a widely famous and powerful religious leader, considered to be emperor of the entire world. Like Brent Weeks' other series, this one introduces a castle of fascinating and unique characters and a world that, while not as dark or gritty as the <em>Night Angel Trilogy</em>, still paints a unique picture of a fantasy world.</p><p>The series is now complete, and consists of:</p><ul><li> <em>The Black Prism</em> (2010)</li><li> <em>The Blinding Knife</em> (2012)</li><li> <em>The Broken Eye</em> (2014)</li><li> <em>The Blood Mirror</em> (2016)</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <em>The Burning White</em> (2019)</li></ul><p>Interestingly, the author was worried about the series, which he had planned as a trilogy, and consequently named it "The Lightbringer <em>Series</em>" in order to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">Trilogy Creep</a>.</p><p>Not to be confused with Oliver Johnson's Lightbringer Trilogy, an older, entirely different series made up of <em>The Forging of the Shadows</em>,<em>The Nations of the Night</em> and <em>The Last Star at Dawn</em>.</p><hr><h2>These books contain examples of:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence">Above the Influence</a>: Kip wins <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teia</span> in a card game but refuses to take advantage of her, knowing that she is only claiming to be okay with it because he is her master and she doesn't want him to punish her. Not that he would of course.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">Absurdly High-Stakes Game</a>: Andross makes Kip play games of Nine Kings with stakes including, but not limited to:<ul><li> Kip's friends being expelled from the Chromeria.</li><li> Adrasteia's slavery papers.</li><li> Being forced to annul his marriage (which was Andross' idea in the first place).</li></ul></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Kip's mother, of the emotional and neglectful kind. Andross Guile of the ambitious, ruthless, controlling and domineering kind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: Gavin in <em>The Black Prism.</em> He creates the fastest means of travel in the world, learns to fly, and builds Brightwater Wall. He makes it all look easy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Karris, Liv, Teia, any female Blackguard and many female drafters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: Zig-zagged. The only character who doesn't have a fantasy name is protagonist Gavin Guile.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: One of the most powerful immortal warriors in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a> takes the form of a librarian when in the Seven Satrapies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">Alternative Calendar</a>: Averted. The only date on the calendar that's referenced is the summer solstice, a holiday called Sun-Day. Hardly surprising, for a culture where light is so important that hasn't invented any light source comparable to the sun.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>: The afterword from <em>The Blood Mirror</em> explains that the issue experienced by Tisis is a real disorder called vaginismus.<ul><li> Additionally, the rate of super- and subchromacy being tied to gender is based on real life differences in human vision. Females generally have better color perception, and males are more likely to be colorblind. This likely evolved as a sort of low key <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>; red-green colorblindness (the most common kind) has been shown to be advantageous in seeing through the camouflage of prey animals. Likewise, women evolved more discerning color palettes in order to differentiate between healthy and poisonous fruits and berries.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>: Tyrean natives are dark-skinned and are implied to live in a tropical climate (their primary exports are oranges). Kip's mother is Tyrean, and while the nationality of the Guiles isn't elaborated on, Gavin and Dazen have red hair, implying they're much paler. As a result, Kip has tan skin and freckles, a combination that the narration notes as unusual.<ul><li> Corvan is stated to have the same dark-skin-and-freckles appearance, and is explicitly called a "half-breed."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a>: The Order of the Broken Eye. Played with in that there's some conjecture on whether it's been the same ancient conspiracy for the past few centuries, or if unrelated groups have emerged, claimed the name, and later disbanded.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>: The series ends on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gavin</span> convincing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ironfist</span>, battered as they are, to come with him on another adventure: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> using the Blinding Knife to kill the eight Elohim imprisoned in the Chromeria's heart for good</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">Angel Unaware</a>: Kip's guardian angel has her first appearance in the guise of a simple librarian.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Gavin very likely has, by his own admission, the highest body count in the history of the Seven Satrapies. Despite this, there are multiple examples of his ruthlessness being the least-bad option. For example, he ended a centuries-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> by killing a few dozen agitators. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not to mention that most of those casualties come from sixteen years of ritualistically murdering drafters, a task which he loathes beyond all others.</span><ul><li> A large section of <em>The Burning White</em> is devoted to exploring both the heroic and villainous aspects of Gavin Guile, including a fair number of details even <em>he</em> didn't know.</li><li> Teia becomes one during her infiltration into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Order of the Broken Eye</span>. She ultimately has to kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">innocent slaves</span> and finds herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowlySlippingIntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowlySlippingIntoEvil">getting less and less bothered by it as time goes on</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>: Drafters can't draft a color in the proximity of it's respective Bane. The Bane are Eldritch monstrosities that the office of Prism is designed to prevent from forming, and there is no other way to suppress a drafter. This means that this is a huge advantage, since warrior-drafters don't train to fight without drafting.<ul><li> Additionally, piercing a drafter's skin with obsidian, also known as "hellstone" or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> black Luxin</span> will make them unable to draw Luxin and will also drain away any Luxin they've already packed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>: Seven. The Chromeria teaches that seven is Orholam's number and is holy. Interestingly, the number serves as a representation of the Chromeria. As the series goes on, the reader sees how forced this number is as the Chromeria's secrets are slowly revealed. The Seven Satrapies used to be Nine Kingdoms. There are seven colors on the spectrum, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but only because three or possibly four have been declared heretical and their drafters killed in pogroms.</span> There are seven seats on the Spectrum council, but Ruthgar has two seats and Tyrea has none. Etcetera, etcetera.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">Archnemesis Dad</a>: Andross Guile, to Gavin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And also Andross Guile, to Kip, although Kip isn't aware of this yet.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Aristocrats Are Evil</a>: Andross Guile is the king of this trope, but the other nobility do little to avert it. The highborn characters include a despot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher">The Butcher</a> of Aghbalu, a fratricide, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, a torturer, and a blasphemous rebel who's barely even human anymore.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: "I've forgiven your many, many murders. Will you forgive him one?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">Armor-Piercing Slap</a>: Karris does this to Gavin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the fake</span> when she learns that he cheated on her while they where engaged and, as a result, has a bastard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Who isn't actually his but the real Gavin's. When she later finds out Dazen's (the real one's) deception, she does it again.</span><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Who it turns out, isn't actually even Gavin's son, but his half-brother. Andross is the father. Maybe. In <em>The Burning White</em> he claims to have been lying about that; whether he actually was or not is left unclear.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfAttraction">Artifact of Attraction</a>: The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> banes</span> are this, though Gavin and the Blackguard don't initially realize it. Each one has a "seed crystal" of the appropriate color at its core, which draws wights to it inexorably. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This lack of knowledge means that the victories scored against the blue and green banes in <em>The Blinding Knife</em> are temporary, since the seed crystals are still at large and will reform in a few months.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>: The Blinding Knife, the master cloak, true Nine Kings cards, and the seed crystals, especially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> black</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: Gunner the pirate's only appearance in <em>The Black Prism</em> is to be briefly recognized, then defeated nonlethally by Gavin. His only personality traits are that isn't that bright but might be the best gunner in the world. His role expands considerably in <em>The Blinding Knife,</em> and then further in <em>The Broken Eye.</em><ul><li> Aside from Kip, Cruxer, and Teia, the members of the Mighty don't have much in the way of characterization until <em>The Blood Mirror</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>: It's extremely difficult for a non-drafter to fight a drafter of any kind. There are also almost no non-drafters wielding any amount of authority in the Seven Satrapies. This is not a coincidence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>: Tremblefist joined the Blackguard and took a name derivative of his brother's. He did this because he wanted people to think of him as Ironfist's brother, rather than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Butcher of Aghbalu</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: The Green Golem technique.

When we learn more about it in <em>The Blinding Knife</em>, that comparison is replaced. Nine Kings is a strategy game where players use preconstructed decks of unique cards to execute a strategy and counteract their opponent's. Cards are based on spellcasters, soldiers, magic, and equipment, with each card divided into a color of magic. There are even different sets of cards, with new ones being created over time, and some older cards being declared heretical and banned...but still played in side formats. Anyone who's played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> will spot the similarities long before Weeks acknowledges it in the Afterword.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Abaddon</span> is an immortal creature who takes the appearance of an angel, calls himself the Bringer of Light, and radiates menace.

Drafting doesn't explicitly kill its users. Rather, as a drafter drafts, the irises of their eyes fill up with the appropriate colors. If the rings caused by drafting push past the edges of the iris, the drafter "breaks the halo," and is overcome by their color, becoming a color wight. However, the extent to which this dehumanizes the drafter is a central disagreement among the characters, with the Chromeria seeing them as insane monsters and the Blood Robes seeing them as the next stage in a drafter's communion with their color. Most drafters will break the halo around forty, though we see a few drafters in middle age, one who is elderly, and another who is barely twenty. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Liv Danavis breaks the halo at eighteen <em>on purpose.</em></span> The narration highlights that bichromes and polychromes have an advantage over monochromes in that halos seem to track separately; a polychrome will usually break only one halo, meaning they can fall back on other colors if they're close to breaking one halo. Monochromes must choose between going Wight and ceasing to draft entirely.<ul><li> Chi drafting is a much straighter use of this trope. Chi is heavily implied to be X-ray radiation, and using it literally kills the drafter by way of radiation poisoning. One Chi drafter claims most have five to ten years of active drafting before their bodies fail.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryBetrayal">Cavalry Betrayal</a>: A rare heroic example. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The pirate king's fleets looked set to attack the Chromeria under the White King's banner only for them to turn on the pagans instead.

However, several prophecies related to the Lightbringer don't seem to reference either of them, so it's possible that <em>neither</em> is a Chosen One.<ul><li> <em>The Burning White</em> elaborates that there have been many <em>potential</em> Lightbringers over the centuries, waiting for the eventual candidate who would realize the title.

A drafter has a subset of colors they can use, usually one, sometimes several. Each color has unique properties and limitations a drafter has to work within. Each color also has a unique influence on a user's personality while it is being used, although experienced drafters are better at controlling this.<ul><li> The seven colors recognized by the Chromeria are introduced in <em>The Black Prism</em>. They are:<ul><li> Superviolet: Heavily implied to be ultraviolet radiation, superviolet exists outside the normal visible spectrum. Its drafters can supernaturally narrow their pupils to see it. Superviolet is invisible to everyone but superviolet and Chi drafters, and this is where most of it's utility comes from. It's primarily used for secrecy, both sending communication and shaping it into a dome to prevent others from overhearing. Using superviolet suppresses emotion and makes the drafter more logical.</li><li> Blue: Blue Luxin is strong and rigid, but brittle. It can also be used to make paste. Blue Luxin is best suited to form solid, unmoving objects&mdash;we see it used on screen mostly to build vehicles and melee weapons like swords. Drafting blue makes one more logical; it downplays emotion but doesn't eliminate it as strongly as superviolet.</li><li> Green: Green Luxin is flexible and dense. It has uses in construction (we see a bridge made out of it early in the first book) and in combat is used to fling heavy balls of it around. It's ideally suited to any Luxin object that requires flexibility, including the joints of some Wights. Drafting green makes the drafter feel wild and independent.</li><li> Yellow: the middle of the spectrum, yellow Luxin is malleable but fickle. It is the type of Luxin that will most easily return to light, making its use by non-superchromats limited. When drafted exactly correctly, its mix of flexibility and rigidity makes it ideal for ships and buildings, giving them room to sway in the wind without compromising structural integrity; the Yellow Tower is the only tower of the Chromeria that's Luxin all the way through. It also makes a great torch, since it converts back to light so easily. Drafting yellow makes a drafter feel balanced between logic and emotion.</li><li> Orange: Orange Luxin isn't discussed in great detail. Its physical form is slippery. Orange can be used to craft Hexes, mind-altering illusions, but this is strictly forbidden by Chromeria rules. Drafting orange makes the drafter feel creative.</li><li> Red: Red Luxin takes the physical form of sticky paste. It is highly flammable, limiting its use beyond that of an accelerant. It is a key component in forging grenades for use in combat. Drafting red makes the drafter feel passionate.</li><li> Subred: Heavily implied to be infrared light, subred Luxin mainfests as heat. This has all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">Mundane Utility</a> one would expect, and is used in combat to hurl fireballs. Outside the visible spectrum like superviolet, subred lets the drafter open their pupils to an inhuman degree. This is subred's <em>other</em> combat application, as it allows drafters to pick out warm, living bodies on a backdrop of colder terrain. Drafting subred seems to make the drafter feel horny.</li></ul></li><li> Other colors are introduced, starting with <em>The Blinding Knife</em>. Note that most of these are "colors" outside the visible spectrum, but are based on real world science.<ul><li> Paryl is below subred, and its drafters can see both paryl and subred (making paryl drafters the only people who can see subred without necessarily being able to draft it). Paryl is powerful and versatile, if subtle. Paryl Luxin usually takes the form of a cloud or tendril. Paryl has the terrifying ability to insert small chunks into vital organs, leading to a death that superficially resembles a heart attack. With a little more skill, paryl drafters can temporarily paralyze limbs. Unlike the other colors, paryl is always available to draft as long as there is light of any kind. When a drafter opens their eyes to the degree required to draft paryl, their entire eye turns black. While in this state, the drafter can see through organic material, causing skeletons and, more importantly, concealed metal objects, to stick out.

Superchromacy is the ability to detect extremely subtle differences in colors, allowing much finer control of Luxin. Using the perfect shade of Luxin allows the drafter to draft objects that will persist longer than the drafter's concentration; we see this used in the Chromeria's yellow tower, Brightwater Wall, the various skimmer designs, and a green bridge outside Rekton. While not exclusively gender locked, superchromats are <em>drastically</em> more common among women; about 50%, compared to less than 1% of men. Kip and Dazen Guile are both exceptions as male superchromats, which isn't surprising since they're so closely related.<ul><li> On the flip side, there are also subchromats&mdash;drafters with partial colorblindness.

Traditional interpretation is that he's a literal being, although a number of characters share their own views on the specifics throughout the series. Andross is essentially a deist, believing that Orholam made the world but takes no part in running it. Gavin veers between that and outright atheism, depending on what has happened recently (though being a religious as well as political leader, he keeps his sometimes atheism to himself). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Grinwoody</span> thinks Orholam is a non-sapient nexus of magical energies, not a person.<ul><li> <em>The Burning White</em> is surprisingly forthcoming with answering the question: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out Orholam is a real being, and there are numerous other immortals who both serve and oppose him.

The Immortals exist outside of time and can choose to manifest wherever and whenever they want. The catch is, there is only one timeline and it's shared by all of creation.

They get around this by working indirectly through a willing, mortal host.

The prison is covered in blue luxin and the food he's given is dyed blue, which for a drafter promotes calmness and is meant to keep him sedated. There's a crisscrossing pattern of luxin in the floor that goes down several feet and blocks his drafting abilities if he tries to dig through. Dazen gets around this by slowly carving out a depression in the wall over sixteen years using his <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">fingernails and then covering the depression with a mixture made of his hair, skin, body oils and sweat</a>. Then he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> urinates on the bowl and uses light that leaked in during Dazen's (the real one's) visits so that the bowl turns yellow enough for him to see. He drafts a small amount of yellow luxin, turns it into the light needed to draft, and then seeps out the heat from the fever in his body to create a spark, which burns the bowl and manages to break through the wall. The hole leads to an obsidian-lined tunnel. Obsidian, when in perfect darkness and through an entrance in the body, seeps luxin away from a drafter so as he crawls through the tunnel, the cuts created by the sharp obsidian on his body allow it to drain away his left-over luxin. The tunnel leads to a similar green room and it turns out that there are seven rooms, one for each colour and presumably connected with their own obsidian-lined tunnels.</span><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, real Gavin later figures out that there couldn't be seven prisons, and probably not even five.

However most drafters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">break the halo around forty</a>, meaning that there are very few elderly drafters, and many of the most powerful people in the world are in their twenties, thirties, or even teens.<ul><li> There are some exceptions, like Orea Pullawr or Andross Guile, who intentionally avoid drafting to keep their halos intact.</li><li> The False Prism's War was led by a teenager on both sides.

Soulcasting requires inserting part of one's soul into an animal or person, taking some degree of direct control. If the drafter dies during a soulcast&mdash;which can happen from soulcasting itself if the drafter forgets to breathe, or through outside intervention&mdash;whatever part of their soul that was in the animal can't leave. The resulting creature is confused, unable to remember which of the two souls in it is its own. This leads to confused animals "remembering" where the human's friends were and going there, only to attack them in its confusion. The prophet "Orholam" also claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sea demons</span> used to be gentle creatures, but were made the way they are by ancient drafter soulcasting them and leaving their souls inside after their human bodies were long since dead.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>: Teia's whole hat.
