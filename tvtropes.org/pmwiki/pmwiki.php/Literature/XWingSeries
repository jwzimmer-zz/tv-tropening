Literally &mdash; Wedge forms it in the first book, looking back on the most successful Rogue rosters and realizing that they were fundamentally composed of pilots with commando skills, then mixing that idea with the odd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerBuildingBlunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerBuildingBlunder">Career-Building Blunder</a> and amping it up as part of a gambit to avoid being promoted to General and becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey">Desk Officer</a>.

This series is known for being much more focused on characters and humor than Stackpole's novels, but isn't without deeper themes. The end of <em>Solo Command</em> leads right up into the earlier-written <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCourtshipOfPrincessLeia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCourtshipOfPrincessLeia">The Courtship of Princess Leia</a></em>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Isard's Revenge</em>, by Stackpole, takes place directly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a> and concerns the efforts of Rogue Squadron to bring justice to Stackpole's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who escaped &mdash; twice &mdash; despite her defeat in the Bacta War, and ties up a few loose ends left after the end of the comics.</p><p><em>Starfighters of Adumar</em>, by Allston, though marketed as a Rogue Squadron novel, is really about Wedge himself; this is essentially his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">Day In The Limelight</a>, focusing on his life, career, friends and love life (or lack thereof) during a diplomatic mission in which he attempts to bring the planet Adumar into the New Republic by winning a flying-duel-based popularity contest.</p><p>While the Rogues and Wraiths also appeared in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em>, the latest true outing of the X-Wing series is another Wraith Squadron novel: <em>Mercy Kill</em>, written by Allston, which was released in August 2012. It takes place primarily in the immediate aftermath of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">Fate of the Jedi</a></em> series, but fills in the time from the end of the Wraith Squadron books up to the "present."</p><p>Half mention also goes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">I, Jedi</a></em>, written by Stackpole and starring Corran Horn.</p><p>Unlike later multiple-authored series, the X-Wing novels are somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">smaller in scope</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel">fit into events established by other books and comics</a>, often retconning little things to make events more sensible. There are some references between the games, the comics, and the novels; ties are most obvious between later comics and Stackpole's novels. Stackpole is known for getting along well with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>, and the two trade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a> with some frequency. Aaron Allston also incorporates characters and events from the series into his mainstream entries of the saga, such as Wedge and the Wraiths in the <em>New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines</em> duology, or Wedge's family in his <em>Legacy of the Force</em> volumes.</p><p>Has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XWingSeries">character sheet</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This series provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes appearing across multiple works&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>:<ul><li> Just about every pilot character in the series is or becomes an ace.

The next three have Wedge leaving the Rogues and founding a new squadron. The non-Wedge protagonist character in <em>Wraith Squadron</em> is undoubtedly Kell Tainer, but his character arc ended with that novel. The next two Wraith books have no single central character - <em>Iron Fist</em> focuses more on Face, Phanan and Wedge while <em>Solo Command</em> deals primarily with Gara/Lara and Myn Donos. <em>Isard's Revenge</em> is another Corran focused story, but in <em>Mercy Kill</em> Face takes over the Wedge role while Voort/Piggy and Wedge's daughter Myri pick up the slack.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomethingCompletelyDifferent">And Now For Something Completely Different</a>: The first four books are relatively straight military SF in Stackpole's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeigeProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeigeProse">Beige Prose</a>, which revolves pretty resolutely around Corran Horn; all other characters are secondary. The next three are along those lines, but Corran is absent and a good deal of humour and personal issue melodrama creep in. The eighth is another Corran book, but the ninth is almost entirely Wedge's personal story about duty versus doing the right thing, as well as probably having more jokes than any other book in the EU.

He urges caution, as unexpected problems will arise between different species, relating his own experience having sex with a Selonian (who seem similar to weasels). While they both enjoyed themselves and everything was apparently "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleToFemaleUniversalAdaptor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleToFemaleUniversalAdaptor">compatible</a>", both had allergic reactions to each other (her fur, Corran's sweat), which made them break things off. Gavin later reports no issues with Asyr however (aside from the fact they can't have children). Rhysati (a Human) and Nawara (a Twi'lek) become a couple too with no apparent sexual issues. It seems to be fairly common, although the Empire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">hates interspecies pairings</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: The series in general is fond of them. Some even span entirely separate series. For example, in <em>Wraith Squadron</em> Kell tells off Grinder for calling him "Demolition Boy" ("That's 'Demolition Boy Sir'") while by the time of the New Jedi Order books the Wraiths are using nicknames of this type as standard code names (Face is "Poster Boy", Kell is "Explosions Boy", Bhindi is "Circuitry Girl"). It gets brought back again late in <em>Mercy Kill</em>, with one of the squad's family members who helps out getting an honorary callsign of this type (a gemologist mocking up weird jewelry for them, he's called "Gem Boy").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">Call a Rabbit a "Smeerp"</a>:<ul><li> As the books deal with everyday life more than most EU books, we get a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a> terms for items. For example, refrigerators are 'conservators', bathrooms are 'refreshers', and showers are 'sanisteams'. (Sanisteam even sounds like a brand name that got genericized, like kleenex or aspirin.)</li><li> Allston pulls off a brilliant 'bilingual' pun with the latter one in <em>Starfighters of Adumar</em> when Tomer Darpen mentions the local ablution facilities are a bit more primitive than what they're used to and they may need teaching how to use them.

On another note, his loyalty to the New Republic is such that if it's for the good of the Republic, he'll do it. No matter how he feels about being jerked around to serve. He has some survivor's guilt. By <em>Starfighters of Adumar</em>, Wedge at least briefly ponders resigning his commission when asked to do something he views as unethical.

The two of them even make a bet in the Wraith Squadron sub-series on whether the squadron will fail, and if Wedge loses he has to take the promotion.

Commando/pilot unit Wraith Squadron feature in just under half the novels, while the elite 181st Imperial Fighter Group are frequent adversaries. Both of the latter, however, actually zigzag this trope; the Wraiths are initially formed from misfit pilots being given their last chance before expulsion from the New Republic military, while the 181st was a unit with low morale and a poor reputation before the arrival of Baron Fel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller">Expecting Someone Taller</a>:<ul><li> This comes up a lot, since pilots tend to be shorter than average due to the small size of cockpits.</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> Also Corran on occasion.

It's rather glaring.</li><li> The Imperial institutionalized speciesism caused backlash. This becomes a major plot point when an alien resistance cell on Coruscant decides it hates the human members of the Rogues. One of the members of the resistance was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Asyr Sei'lar</a>, and she decides to kill her future boyfriend Gavin (a Human) as a speciesist because he's too shy to dance with her (a nearby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">Gotal</a> mistakes his emotions for speciesism).

It wasn't simply a matter of the Empire not wanting to be infected themselves. Rather, they hoped that this would cause resentment toward Humans by these species as they weren't affected, and weaken the New Republic. Similiarly, one of Zsinj's plans involves using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agents</a> to encourage mistrust between the human and nonhuman members of the New Republic.</li><li> The Empire had a secret program, Project Chubar, to "upgrade" members of other species into Human-level intelligence who could then be their agents.

Conversely, Humans such as them aspire to <em>superiority</em> over them. One of Kryneck's officers also reflects that he can understand the New Republic wanting liberty to some extent, but can't accept living with other species-it would just be too unnatural to him.</li><li> In <em>Wraith Squadron</em>, Kell plays a prank that convinces a cantina-full of people that <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Falynn_Sandskimmer">Falynn<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was married to <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Voort_saBinring">Piggy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

It gets worse the more cybernetic they become. Tom Phonan especially suffers from this, since he's gotten most of his body replaced due to a series of injuries (which because of a bacta allergy, require cybernetics instead). He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism">feels this about himself</a>-that every time another part of him is replaced by cybernetic prosthesis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">he's further diminished and feels less himself</a>.

He does relatively little on-screen with bombs, despite being demolitions. His best example was slapping charges into place to damage structures, and slapping a charge onto a probe droid. However, he DOES do a good bit of off-screen bomb defusal, puts together some small explosive charges for Shalla's infiltration of the <em>Razor's Kiss</em>, and manages to design a bomb in his head. He's on the border, but it's interesting.<ul><li> Unlike most examples... he's still made pretty awesome. He's just not awesome at his niche.</li><li> Kell actually does manage to show off his bomb making expertise in the preview for <em>Mercy Kill</em>, where he manages to build a bomb that looks like a priceless gemstone sculpture, is powerful enough take out several city blocks, and is programmed to detonate when it reaches a certain depth below ground.

Forming Wraith Squadron was actually part of a bet &mdash; if he couldn't get them functioning as a full-fledged squadron within three months, he would be forced to accept promotion to General. He wins the bet, of course, but eventually (as in, a year later) he takes the promotion, mostly because his pilots have been refusing promotions too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>: A squadron has twelve pilots, up to twelve potentially distinct (i.e. quirky) astromech droids, a lead mechanic and his team, a quartermaster, and a couple of superior officers. Main characters also have love interests, friends, and enemies. Pilots who die are replaced by new pilots, with new astromechs.

The Y-Wings can't get close enough to the frigate to get a lock and kill it, so Corran has them lock onto his X-Wing's transponder, and then uses a random number generator with the autopilot to evade the frigate's fire and lead the torpedoes into it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One pair of torpedoes actually gets <em>past</em> the frigate, but his astromech Whistler kills the transponder before they can catch up.</span></li><li> The Rogues are also prone to using proton torpedo salvos to "thin the herd" when they fight the Imperials, given they're usually significantly outnumbered by fragile and less heavily armed TIE fighters. The NRDF's logistics people consider this wasteful, and increased production of proton torpedoes is given as a reason to bring the Adumari into the Republic in book nine (it would just be a matter of converting the very large indigenous arms industry).</li><li> How do you take down a Super Star Destroyer if all you have is snubfighters, a 30-year-old frigate and some freighters?

Bothan leader Borsk Fey'lya however also disapproves of Bothan pilot Asyr Sei'lar having a relationship with Human Gavin Darklighter, not only because he dislikes Humans, but due to feeling she's setting a poor example with other Bothans as a result. He pressures her into breaking their relationship off by threatening to use his political power toward this if she doesn't. Before this, the pair had discussed marriage and adopting children (since they can't reproduce naturally).

The assault on Borealis is being commanded by a Bothan general who's very confident in his intelligence, but Wedge brings up that the Bothans are also proud of their sacrifices in getting information on the second Death Star... which turned out to be a trap.

Training for the Rogues and Wraiths isn't shown to be physically demanding. Likewise, while the debut novels for each unit do depict one or more candidates washing out, Wedge's intentions are less about eliminating all but the most elite pilots and more teaching those who do make his units that however skilled they are, they still need to work as a team if they hope to accomplish their missions and live to tell about it.

Wedge's home station was blown up and Corellia is aligned with the Empire, Tycho's from Alderaan, and Corran is (falsely) accused of murder on Corellia. A particularly poignant example would be Tyria's home planet of Toprawa. Her people helped pass along the Death Star plans to the Alliance, and as punishment, the Empire bombed their planet to the Stone Age and enslaved the survivors, making them go through humiliating apology rituals to get even the most basic supplies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a>: Minimum one per book.

To avoid this, they have a brief marriage ceremony aboard <em>Lusankya</em> (with Commander Antilles, temporary captain of the ship, in the role of "priest", and a few droids as witnesses).

He does this by making Zsinj into a skilled actor who pretends to be overly evil and angry on occasion either to impress and mislead his viewers or for his own amusement. The only disadvantage to this otherwise very successful reinvention is that it makes Zsinj's final defeat in the chronologically later <em>Courtship</em> seem very dissappointing in retrospect, considering he is barely even a character in that novel.</li><li> Allston also managed to come up with a plausible explanation for how Zsinj's flagship had been blown up... twice... in the later-set, but earlier-written, novel.</li><li> Allston also fixes (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>) a slight continuity error on Stackpole's part, where Corran Horn meets Han Solo for the first time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">I Jedi</a></em>, despite having served on his ship during the Zsinj campaign several years earlier.

Wedge points this out to them, and is disgusted by the way that the Adumari take no consideration into the fact that the Imperial delegation that's on the same planet is killing dozens of people and no one is sickened by it.

The desire for glory and honor through waging war leads to Cartann in particular, the most powerful (and stereotype-adherent) of the nations of Adumar, acting as imperialist belligerents (at one point Wedge asks his pilots if they even <em>want</em> Adumar in the Republic anymore). The endless dueling leads to a high attrition rate among Adumari pilots, which means few of them live long enough to become proficient. Etiquette prevents the Adumaris from being as effective as people who fight without rules. Shunning teamwork in favor of personal glory makes them undisciplined and uncoordinated, and ignoring battle objectives in favor of personal glory makes them inefficient as a military force, all of which leave them vulnerable to more professional armies like the Republic and the Imperials. Earlier X-wing books had already touched on this: cocky aces Corran Horn and Kell Tainer were both introduced to Wedge's unit with grueling and deeply unfair training sessions, designed to hammer home the notion that it's not their personal achievements, but the squadron's (or army's) as a whole that matters in this job.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">Hurricane of Puns</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePunReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePunReaction">Lame Pun Reaction</a>: Talking to a documentarian with a camera made out of a droid's head on her shoulder, that is currently malfunctioning:<div class="indent">Janson grinned at her.

Piggy delights in telling them that some of the tricks are older than the new Wraiths are.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision">Ludicrous Precision</a>: Piggy's math skills allow him to judge distance down to the <em>centimeter</em> while acting as a spotter for Wran.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Master of Disguise</a>: Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the second generation Wraiths who include Turman the shapeshifting Clawdite, a species that can mimic most humanoid species, and Scut, a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuuzhan Vong who can use modified Vong biotech to create disguises</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>: Piggy gives one to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Runt</span> after being bitten by an amphistaff.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">No Coruscant Holocaust</a>: The scenes of <em>Mercy Kill</em> set on Coruscant make no mention of the utter devastation brought upon the planet by Abeloth (earthquakes, volcanoes and toxic gases that killed <em>billions</em>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">no more than a few months earlier</a>. (On the other hand, as noted in one of the <em>New Jedi Order</em> novels, if you assume a hundred billion people were killed when the Vong took Coruscant, <em>there were still nine hundred billion alive</em>. Billions dead is no small number, but as far as total populace concerned, it's a drop in the bucket.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Only Known by Their Nickname</a>: Bonus points for Scut: even his "real" name, Viull Gorsat, is one he adopted (as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to Yuuzhan Vong warriors) rather than one he was born with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a>: Only two of the original Wraiths play a major role in <em>Mercy Kill</em> outside of flashback scenes. The rest of the cast is a second generation of Wraiths - literally. Two of the new Wraiths are children of former Wraiths, and a third is the nephew of a former Wraith. Kirney makes it quite clear to her former teammates that she does not want them recruiting any of <em>her</em> kids for their latest operation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a>: Voort often dwells over the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Runt</span> in <em>Mercy Kill</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">Potty Emergency</a>: In <em>Mercy Kill</em>, Jesmin Tainer needs to access the auxiliary bridge of a small imperial warship. She does so by using the Force to give the whole crew an urgent need to pee.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProveIAmNotBluffing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProveIAmNotBluffing">Prove I Am Not Bluffing</a>: General Thaal does this to a Duros forger in <em>Mercy Kill</em> by killing his (Thaal's) former mistress in front of him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether">Putting the Band Back Together</a>: The metaplot of <em>Mercy Kill</em> is assembling the new Wraith Squadron.

He eventually has to promise point-blank that he won't, twice, before asking her about the information he really came for.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit">Sniping the Cockpit</a>: pulled off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlySniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlySniper">Friendly Sniper</a> Wran Narcassan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">That Man Is Dead</a>: At the point of the events of <em>Mercy Kill</em>, Voort saBinring no longer goes by "Piggy". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted at the end of the book</span>.</li></ul></div><p></p><hr>
