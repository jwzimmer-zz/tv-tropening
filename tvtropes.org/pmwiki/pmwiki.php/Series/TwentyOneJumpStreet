Holly Robinson Peete also returned as Judy Hoffs, in a slightly more substantial role. The film itself received a sequel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyTwoJumpStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyTwoJumpStreet">22 Jump Street</a>, in 2014, which featured small cameos from Dustin Nguyen and Richard Grieco.</p><p>Due to the drastic difference in tone and contradiction of the show's continuity<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0its7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0its7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0its7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall die in the movie</span> (reportedly Johnny Depp himself demanded his character to die in the movie as a condition for accepting his cameo role) being middle-aged, working for the DEA in 2012, while in the <em>Back from the Future</em> episode of the series, they are shown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to have lived to be very old men in the 2030's after quitting police work</span></span>, the movie is not necessarily recommended for fans of the series.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><hr><h2>This series provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#&#150;C&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair">'80s Hair</a>: Penhall's and Ioki's mullets. Hanson's longer haircut he had in Season 3.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Abhorrent Admirer</a>: Judy, when undercover at university, is pursued by a guy whom she doesn't like and who doesn't take no for an answer; at a certain point she even says to him "I find you repulsive".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: The police team often run into these during their work with teenagers. Some examples:<ul><li> A father sexually abuses his daughter. What's worst is that the girl went to police several times, but because her father is a police captain himself, he is able to cover up all her cries for help.</li><li> A family where the children are physically abused by the parents.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsDressedAsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsDressedAsChildren">Adults Dressed as Children</a>: More adults dressed as teenagers; the whole premise of the show is young looking police officers going undercover in high schools. In the pilot episode, Judy takes Hanson shopping to outfit him in the right (meaning hip for teenagers) clothes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirVentPassageway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirVentPassageway">Air-Vent Passageway</a>: Several schools are broken into this way during the show. In one episode, Harry tries to sneak in through the vents while a school is under siege. He gets inside, but the vent and ceiling give way beneath him at the worst possible time, dropping him in front of a bunch of guys with guns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding">Ambiguous Ending</a>: Due to the show's attempts to confront such difficult issues as drug use and criminal behavior in high schools somewhat realistically, episodes often end this way, sometimes qualifying for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> if a student they're trying to protect dies or goes to jail, but leaving the viewer with the question of what to do about the tragic circumstances that led to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: Judy and Fuller are both African-American, but he's one generation older. They get into a discussion about racism, with him being much more cynic about it. Judy is outspoken against him, until he asks this and she doesn't know what to say anymore after it:<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Fuller:</strong> What does your father work as?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Judy:</strong> You know that.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Fuller:</strong> I want you to say it. What does your father work as?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Judy:</strong> He's a dentist.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Fuller:</strong> Mine was a bell-boy.</div></dd></dl></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockJock">Shock Jock</a> whose car gets blown up in "Next Victim". Due to his hateful and racist ranting, the team is none too happy about having to look for the person who did it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fanboy</a>: meta version for Johnny Depp. From his earliest interviews, he's stated his admiration for Charlie Chaplin and especially Buster Keaton. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">"Rashomon"-Style</a> episode "How I saved the Senator", Hanson's 'movie' is a silent film in the style of Buster Keaton. This was apparently at Depp's suggestion/request.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabysittingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabysittingEpisode">Babysitting Episode</a>: In "Next Generation", Doug has a crush on his neighbour, who is a single mum; he hopes to go out on a date with her, but instead she asks him to babysit her baby, which he isn't enthusiastic about, but he does it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadButt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadButt">Bad Butt</a>: Every instance of the word "ass" was dubbed over with the word "tail" in the first Season, leading to "I'll kick your tail!" and such. The mouths of the actors clearly are saying "ass" though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchCredits">Bait-and-Switch Credits</a>: Peter DeLuise mentions in his commentary track for one of the episodes of the first season: the credits feature a bunch of gunplay and a car flipping over; however, the series mostly is about undercover work and centers around sedate dialog-driven scenes. The car flipping over was one of the most expensive scenes shot for the series, and was really the only one of its kind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a>: In Joey Penhall's first episode, he's sent undercover into a cult, despite his lack of previous undercover experience, because he has the same kind of history and psychological profile as the kids who are being recruited. But it doesn't take much, or take very long, for Joey to become a genuine convert, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">precisely because he does have the same psychological profile</a> as the kids considered ripe for recruitment. This is actually Lampshaded by both Joey and Doug during the later scenes when Doug is talking to Joey to deprogram him from the cult's mindset.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitterSweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitterSweetEnding">Bitter Sweet Ending</a>: In most episodes, the biggest immediate problem / case was solved while they still had a very TearJerker-y ending. Just some examples:<ul><li> "Blindsided": A father who sexually abused his daughters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is arrested and prosecuted. But, since their mother is dead, they're now orphans, and since they're all still under age, they will probably be moved around orphanages or foster homes from now on, and lose their house</span>.</li><li> "Draw The Line": Hanson luckily is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">exonerated (he had been wrongfully convicted for murder) with help from Booker; and Ioki survives and wakes up from his coma</span>. But Booker is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reassigned To Antarctica</span> as punishment for his having broken the rules to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">exonerate Hanson, something which makes Booker quit his job and abruptly leave the series on the spot; and Ioki gets anxiety issues and develops an addiction to Morphine as a result of his shooting</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackGalOnWhiteGuyDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackGalOnWhiteGuyDrama">Black Gal on White Guy Drama</a>: "Don't Stretch the Rainbow" takes place at a high school with racial tensions, and a black girl and white boy who have a relationship have to keep this a secret, for fear of both getting violent repercussions for it. She even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">does a suicide attempt first seemingly because of the racial tensions, though later also explained to be because she is pregnant. The ending is on a happier note though, as they decide to raise the baby together, and come out with their relationship which really does seem to make an impression on the other students</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowlingForRatings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowlingForRatings">Bowling for Ratings</a>: Hanson is an avid bowler, and is seen at bowling alleys in a few episodes. Specifically, he is seen bowling with two of his girlfriends he has during different times in the series (first Jackie and later Linda).<div class="indent"><strong>Hanson:</strong> I can't Friday, that's my bowling night.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Penhall:</strong> Your <em>bowling</em> night?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Hanson:</strong> Yes.

But that case itself is solved within 15 minutes and the episode turns out to be about Judy's rape, making her the victim here instead of the police officer.

The actors aged so much in Real Life, that after a few seasons they couldn't realistically pass for high school students anymore. Therefore, as of Season 3, episodes start to deviate from the, previously standard, High School setting as where the Jump Street crew goes undercover&mdash;and start to cover different, more adult, environments they go undercover in. E.g. <em>Hell Week</em> takes place at a college / university; <em>Blinded by the Thousand Points of Light</em> is about homeless young adults; <em>A.W.O.L.</em> is about a soldier on the run. This was played up even more in Season 4, which had even more episodes set at college / university instead of high school (<em>Say It Ain't So, Pete</em>, <em>Stand By Your Man</em>, <em>Research and Destroy</em>), and was when a Jump Street crew member, Penhall, first went undercover as a staff member instead of as a student (<em>Blackout</em> / <em>Business as Usual</em>). By Season 5, Penhall and Hoffs have visibly aged enough that they have not only been on 'regular' duties more than once, but in Season 5 they're both sent undercover as <em>staff</em> more than students. E.g. in <em>Diplomas for Sale</em>, Doug, Judy and new guy Mac are college, not high school students. <em>Poison</em>, Judy is a guidance counsellor, and Penhall is off-site support for the guest star undercover agent; in <em>Just say no! high</em>, Judy is a student, but Doug is an assistant sports coach.<ul><li> one of the reasons (besides Johnny Depp leaving) that Mac McCann and Joey Penhall joined the cast season 5; they still looked young enough to pass as high school students, even if only as seniors. You can really tell the difference, when Doug and Michael DeLuise are in a scene together.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a>:<ul><li> Hanson feels this way about his (forced) transfer to Jump Street in the Pilot: he is transferred there because some incidents happened because he's too young looking to be a uniformed cop. When he hears it from the Chief, he originally is strongly opposed to it, saying he wants to be a real cop (meaning patrol/uniformed), "like [his] father was". The Chief makes it clear he must go to Jump Street, he does, he eventually likes it and we get the rest of the series.</li><li> After Booker has violated many rules in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get the falsely convicted Hanson out of prison</span>, he is disciplined by being reassigned to a paper work job in the basement of the police library.

Delighted at this turn of events, Penhall decides not to speak to him and returns home quietly gloating how he got the classic best revenge by living well.</li><li> He even suffered a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrewMyBikeOnTheRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrewMyBikeOnTheRoof">Threw My Bike on the Roof</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere">Screw This, I'm Out of Here!</a>:<ul><li> Penhall sets up Hanson for a double date with his [Penhall's] girlfriend, and his co-worker Jackie, whom he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">wants to set up</a> Hanson with. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDate">Double Date</a> very quickly turns sour with Hanson and Jackie bickering over work issues, upon which Hanson simply announces "I'm gonna go", and leaves, leaving a confused Penhall and Dorothy behind with a half-finished dinner.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode">Sequel Episode</a>:<ul><li> In the pilot, Hanson arrests a young teenage boy for drug possession; in season 2's <em>I'm okay, you need work</em> his sister contacts Hanson to investigate the rehab clinic her brother has been placed in for patient abuse.</li><li> Also in the pilot episode was a criminal character who Hanson arrested&mdash;Reggie.

A flashback to the day of the Challenger Explosion in January 1986 shows Ioki working a case and the Jump Street squad commenting on Captain Fuller as if he were still new to the squad. The first episode of the series aired in April 1987; Captain Jenko was still in charge at that point and Hanson was just joining the squad.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>:<ul><li> Penhall, in an awkward twist, is caught flirting with his co-worker Jackie by his girlfriend Dorothy. Penhall then, in an effort to control the damage, sets up a double-date in order to hook up Jackie with his best friend and partner Hanson. Almost ironically, Penhall and Dorothy break up soon afterwards while Hanson and Jackie get together and stay together during almost the whole rest of the season.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotInTheAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotInTheAss">Shot in the Ass</a>: Happens to Hanson in <em>The Dragon and the Angel</em>. Even worse, it turns out to be Penhall's fault.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: A lot of episodes are named after, or based on '50s to '70s classic songs &mdash; <em>Things We Said Today</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>), <em>Chapel Of Love</em> (The Dixie Cups), <em>School's Out</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a>), <em>Woolly Bull(ies)</em> (Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs), <em>Stand By Your Man</em> (Tammy Wynette), <em>(Re)search and Destroy</em> (Iggy and the Stooges), <em>Awomp-Bomb-Aloobomb, Aloop Bamboom</em> (Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti"). There are also several examples of 1980s songs being used as inspiration for episode titles &mdash; <em>Tunnel of Love</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>), <em>What About Love</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart">Heart</a>), <em>In the Name of Love</em> (U2) and <em>(My) Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades</em> (Timbuk 3). Although the song came out a few years after the episode, <em>Loc'd Out</em> ("Locked Out") was one of the first international hits for legendary Australian music group Crowded House.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst">Shower of Angst</a>: Officer Judy Hoffs plays this trope straight after one of the characters in the case she was working on rapes her. Despite knowing intellectually, as a detective, that this would destroy much of the evidence, she is too traumatised by the event to plan out her actions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnackIsMoreInteresting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnackIsMoreInteresting">The Snack Is More Interesting</a>: Hanson distracts himself with eating grapes when Judy finds him sitting at Fuller's desk and, understandably, asks him why he's there and where everybody else is. Hanson puts a grape in his mouth and answers with his mouth full. He's trying to brush her off to prevent her from knowing where the other cops are (unsuccesfully).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a>:<ul><li> The episode "Mike's P.O.V." is told entirely from the perspective of a high school student named Mike who is paid by a teacher to assassinate his wife. The Jump Street members appear to be regular students to him.</li><li> "La Bizca" doesn't feature any policework at all, doesn't take place in Jump Street's own town but in El Salvador and doesn't feature anybody from the cast except Hanson and Penhall. The episode is about the civil war in El Salvador, something drastically different than the usual "crime and social issues amongst (American) teenagers" format.</li><li> "Chapel of Love" doesn't show any police work, instead the main characters all tell stories about dates they had (it's a Valentine's episode).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>: "Don't Pet the Teacher": A female, pretty young and attractive, teacher at a high school is stalked by continuously getting love notes and unwanted presents by an unknown admirer. At first she and the police suspect it's one of her high school students <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but turns out it's the school's janitor</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a>: Tyrell "Waxer" Thompson, a drug dealer harassing a client to pay overdue fees. He never returns after his arrest, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dragon">Dragon</a> Reggie does.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/StockYuck/Anchovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/StockYuck/Anchovies">Stock Yuck - Anchovies</a>: Played straight when a character orders pizza and threatens to kill someone else if there's any anchovies on it. Also see Hold The Unsolicited Ingedient.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrikeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrikeEpisode">Strike Episode</a>: In the "Blu Flu" episode, the whole cast of police officers is on a strike, sans Captain Fuller, as Police Captains apparently are considered "administrative personnel" and as such have no right to be unionized. Hanson even is an active participant of his trade union, and as such takes part in official negotiations between the trade union and the municipality.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a>: David Barry Gray's Dean Garrett replacing Johnny Depp's Tom Hanson. However, he never got beyond recurring character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and he was later killed off in Season 5</span>; Season 5's Tony McCann did somewhat better <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in fact, he's the one who brings Garrett's killer to justice.</span></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&#150;Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATankardOfMooseUrine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATankardOfMooseUrine">A Tankard of Moose Urine</a>: Hanson must drink a few glasses of a bright green alcoholic drink when undercover at a fraternity. From the expression he has when doing this, it's clear that it tastes terrible. He also immediately throws up after the last shot, and afterwards Fuller remarks that he looks "green".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">Teacher/Student Romance</a>: Played with with Johnny Depp's character, who is in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">mid-twenties</a> and not <em>actually</em> a student, but met and flirted with a woman just before he was actually assigned to her school and discovered she was now his teacher. For bonus points, this happens in an episode that frequently mentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Teen Pregnancy</a>:<ul><li> "Don't Stretch the Rainbow" was mainly about racial tensions at a high school and a relationship between a black girl and a white boy there (that they had to keep secret to avoid escalation of the racial tensions). The girl turns out to be pregnant, and she and the boy together tell the whole school not only about their relationship, but that they are also going to raise this baby together, no matter what, and that the other students should take this as an inspiration to stop the racial hate. Their message does seem to make an impact.</li><li> "Whose Choice Is It Anyway" featured this prominently, since it was about pregnant teenagers considering whether they should get an abortion, against the backdrop story of violence against abortion clinics. There was one pregnant girl in particular that Judy befriended.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong">That Came Out Wrong</a>: Judy and Doug, both acting impulsively, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">make out and even almost have sex</span>. Afterwards, Judy feels awkward about it and then accuses Doug of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">deliberately having tried to seduce her&mdash;her reasoning being "you had a condom with you"</span>&mdash;which might make her a hypocrite <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5iv3c');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5iv3c" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5iv3c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Keep in mind that this happened at a time Aids was still a death sentence, and that Judy had already unintentionally gotten pregnant once before at 17.</span>, but Doug's answer to that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">doesn't help his case</a>: he blurts out that he <em>always</em> has condoms with him <em>"just like you always have a spare tire in your car in case your car breaks down"</em>. Causing Judy to answer "O great, so I am a road accident?!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">Token Romance</a>:<ul><li> Hanson has a girlfriend, Amy, during Season 2; she only briefly shows up in three episodes <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6n02a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6n02a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6n02a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the one they get together; one scene at a Christmas dinner during the Christmas episode; and one scene in the episode she dies</span>, doesn't have any relevance to the plot <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note79a5d');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note79a5d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note79a5d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">during she's alive, anyway; ironically it isn't until she dies that she becomes important (if only for one episode) to Hanson</span>, and they don't have chemistry or anything in common and Hanson isn't even attracted to her. It's telling that when she dies, Hanson mostly feels guilty about that he as a cop failed to overmaster the robber who shot her, rather than missing her as a person.</li><li> Averted for Hanson's next girlfriend, Jackie, who was written in as a colleague of Penhall's, and who worked as a D.A., thus her work partially overlapped with Hanson's.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: Whether or not it was deliberately inspired by the show, using young-looking police officers undercover as high school students has <em>actually been done</em>. Read about the real-life example of Alex Salinas <a class="urllink" href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/03/real-life-21-jump-street-undercover-cop-returns-to-high-school/">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverCopReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverCopReveal">Undercover Cop Reveal</a>: In just about every episode, due to the show entirely revolving about undercover cops, at the end the cops show their badges and reveal themselves to be cops. Most of the times this happens when they arrest the suspect, though sometimes they reveal themselves before the arrest, to someone who isn't a suspect but they think can help solve their case. The reaction of the people they reveal themselves to varies from contempt, to shock, to hurt for feeling betrayed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>: The show often dealt with hot-button issues, and often had a brief spot afterward with a phone number for the organization dedicated to addressing a particular social problem. Most notable examples:<ul><li> "Whose Choice Is It Anyway?" is about abortion, and violence against abortion clinics.</li><li> "The Girl Next Door" revisited the topic of HIV. This example is particularly interesting, because it also showed how treatment (see Science Marches On on Trivia Page) and some attitudes towards HIV had advanced, even during the 2 or 3 years between the episodes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot">Vomit Discretion Shot</a>: Hanson drinks many strong alcoholic drinks as part of a hazing ritual at a fraternity, and promptly vomits on his tormentor's shoes. We only see his backside but not any vomit during this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: Season 4 ep. 4 "Come From The Shadows": Doug, who previously in the series had only had a serious relationship with Dorothy but otherwise was always pretty much a flirt with all women <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8hdpn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8hdpn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8hdpn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">including that he almost slept with his co-worker Judy</span>, falls seriously in love with and marries an El Salvadorian woman. She is extradited out of the U.S. by the end of the episode and in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> manner, isn't mentioned in any way for 14 episodes; then ep. 18 "La Bizca", another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>, shows Doug and Tom going to war-ridden El Salvador to look for her <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0thvn');"><sup>spoiler&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0thvn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0thvn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">only to find out she has been murdered, but at least this gives Doug some closure.</span> For the remainder of the season, her entire existance is again ignored (though Doug adopts and cares for her nefew Clavo).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a>:<ul><li> "Wooly Bullies" had all characters tell about being bullied in their childhood, and featured flashbacks for all of them.</li><li> "Things We Said Today": A teenager who Ioki befriended during an investigation three years earlier, shows up, and tells Ioki in flashbacks how that event shaped his and his family's life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieOfTheWeek">Woobie of the Week</a>: In many episodes. Some of the most prominent:<ul><li> A family Officer Judy coincidentally finds out physically abuses their teenage children (her Captain Fuller wants her to stay out of it, but she insists on helping the teenage children who are battered).</li><li> Mike from the Season 4 episode "Mike's P.O.V.": A teenage boy who murders the wife of his teacher for money; the episode explains his back story, which is that he has a major crush on one of his class mates, and it's implied he only did it to impress her.</li><li> Kyle, the antagonist of "Things We Said Today": His life wasn't all that great when he met Ioki; but Ioki's friendship directly influenced him into making a decision whose consequences sent his life straight to rock bottom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after finding out the whole story, Ioki <em>agrees</em>; when Kyle is charged over his holding Ioki at gunpoint, Ioki tries to speak on Kyle's behalf in court, but the judge throws out Ioki's offer of testimony. Ioki pleads with Kyle to speak up on his own behalf, but Kyle silently refuses; it's a testimony to Keith Coogan's performance that he gets across without words that he's had more than enough of Harry Ioki's 'help'.</span></li><li> Then there's Lisa Burbank, in "In The Name of Love"; she's an outcast at school because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerd</a> image, plus rumors that her father's a criminal&mdash;which she fiercely denies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But when she's visiting her father at his business warehouse, it's raided by the FBI &amp; police&mdash;and she recognises one of the officers in the raid as the new kid at school... the cute guy who became her first friend in years, and who she even asked to have sex with her! Then undeniable proof is found that the father she's so loyally defended is a drug smuggler, and very likely guilty of everything he's been accused of (and the viewer knows that he's guilty of at least one murder)... and the only person willing to comfort her is said undercover cop, who pulls her into a tear-stained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownHug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownHug">Cool Down Hug</a> as her father is led away in handcuffs.</span><ul><li> and Mac borders on Woobie territory in this ep, himself. 'Persuaded' by the FBI into taking this particular undercover assignment, at the same time he's trying very hard to reconcile with his visiting ex-lover, Samantha. Mac feels uneasy about targeting Lisa to get to her father right from the start, and becomes even more so as the ep progresses, because Lisa really is a nice girl who he honestly likes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But Lisa runs into Mac attending a business function with Samantha as her date. Lisa throws a fit, which not only blows his cover, but brings down criticism from the FBI. While he manages a last-ditch idea to justify a raid of Burbank's warehouse, he has to watch Lisa, who he's genuinely grown fond of, becoming more and more upset. After Burbank is arrested, he comes home to find his ex packing her bags; she's decided that she can't deal with his career.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
