Even though one of the two was born when Dorothy was still in high school, and thus should have been in at least their mid-forties, both were consistently played by actors in their twenties and early thirties.</li><li> Another example is the episode in which Rose stubbornly adopts a puppy despite a prior agreement between the housemates that they can't get a dog; yet in another episode, Blanche and Dorothy get Rose a dog from a shelter.</li><li> One episode states that Rose, before moving in with Blanche and Dorothy, was thrown out of her apartment because she secretly had a cat and was caught; another episode has her reminiscing about Rusty, a dog she had when her children were growing up, who saved the family cat from a house fire. However, Rose is later shown to be very allergic to cats.</li><li> In one episode, Dorothy states that her grandmother died at age 94 when she herself was 6. Yet in a flashback episode, Dorothy is shown as a young woman (played by Lyn Greene) with her grandmother (played by Bea Arthur), already married to Stan. Granted, it could have been Dorothy's paternal grandmother who died when she was 6, since the grandma in the flashback was Sophia's mother; but in <em>another</em> episode, Sophia and her brother talk about their mother dying in Sicily before they moved to the US.</li><li> Speaking of Sophia, there was also the matter of her siblings. In the first two seasons, she said that her only living relative was her sister Angela, who disappeared after two appearances. Later in the series, she was suddenly revealed to have a brother named Angelo. She also apparently has a brother Vito who is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnseen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnseen">The Unseen</a>, and another unseen relative named Regina who might be Sophia's sister or might be Salvatore's sister.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptivityHarmonica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptivityHarmonica">Captivity Harmonica</a>: Stan plays one when he and Dorothy must serve a period of house arrest in an infested apartment.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingCouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingCouch">Casting Couch</a>: Even sleeping with the director of the local theatre production of <em>Macbeth</em> couldn't land Blanche the role of Lady Macbeth; that went, inadvertently, to Rose.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">Catchphrase</a>:<ul><li> Dorothy: "This is ridiculous!"</li><li> Blanche: "I am stunned!" and "Get outta here!"</li><li> Stanley: "Hi, it's me, Stan."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityLie">Celebrity Lie</a>:<ul><li> Rose claimed that she was the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHope">Bob Hope</a> in order to get him to perform for a benefit&mdash;the variation being that she genuinely believed this to be true (she was an orphan and reminisced about seeing Hope on a movie screen as a child, becoming convinced that he was her father). Luckily for her, he turned out to be the old vaudeville partner of Sophia's boyfriend and showed up anyway.</li><li> Rose once told a story about her mother dating race-car driver Andy Granatelli, though no indication was given as to the veracity of this story.</li><li> Blanche liked to engage in this frequently. Probably her biggest case of this is when she claims to have slept with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> in order to convince Rose to elect her president of their newly-established Elvis fan club. (After Rose leaves the room, Dorothy calls her out, and she admits that she never slept with Elvis himself - but she did once sleep with "an unattractive man named Elmer" and called him by Elvis's name, and she feels that counts.)</li><li> In the most extreme example, Blanche claimed to <em>be</em> Angie Dickinson in "Grab That Dough."</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Blanche:</strong> I have altered my appearance for a very important movie role.</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Dorothy:</strong> It's about a woman who <em>eats</em> her way from behind the Iron Curtain.</div><ul><li> After an argument with Blanche, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Rose calls her out</a> on all of her far-fetched <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheGoldenGirls/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheGoldenGirls/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> sexual encounters of questionable authenticity.

Rue McClanahan performed in a production of the same musical at New Hampshire's Hampton Playhouse over two decades earlier, in which she was cast as the Baroness (and just missed being crushed to death by a falling chandelier during one performance).</li><li> In "Ladies of the Evening," Rose lists off some of the celebrities that will be attending the premiere of Burt Reynolds's new movie. Charles Nelson Reilly is on the list; Betty White made several appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em> with Reilly during the 1970s and '80s. Also, the later episode "Grab That Dough" sees the girls going on the game show of the same name, and Rose compares the host, Guy Corbin, to several other famous game show hosts of the era; one such host is Gene Rayburn, who hosted the aforementioned <em>Match Game</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> clearly exists in the Girls' universe, as Rose mentions <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV">Rocky IV</a></em> in one episode and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rambo">Rambo</a></em> in another. Stallone appeared with Estelle Getty (Sophia) in the infamous flop <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopOrMyMomWillShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopOrMyMomWillShoot">Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot</a></em></li><li> In two different episodes, Dorothy, played by Bea Arthur, sings a few bars of songs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FiddlerOnTheRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FiddlerOnTheRoof">Fiddler on the Roof</a></em>. Guess who played Yente the Matchmaker in the original Broadway production?</li><li> Dorothy mentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a> a few times. Ball was a personal friend of Bea Arthur's, and the two even appeared together in the disastrous 1974 film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mame">Mame</a></em>, with Ball taking over the role originated on stage by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaLansbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaLansbury">Angela Lansbury</a>. Lansbury, another close personal friend of Arthur's, was also the star of TV's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em>, which is also mentioned by Dorothy on at least one occasion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfCorrections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfCorrections">Chain of Corrections</a>: When Sophia and Rose attempt to figure out who the president is married to:<div class="indent"><strong>Rose</strong>: Well, it doesn't matter anyway, they're not married anymore.

Hello??</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Blanche:</strong> Dorothy, is your mother all right?</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Dorothy:</strong> Oh fine! She does something wrong, suddenly she's MY mother!</div><ul><li> Season one's "Blanche and the Younger Man" handled this between Rose and her mother, Alma, but more seriously and less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. Rose is overbearing and smothering toward her mother out of fear of losing her, and Alma chafes at Rose's overprotective behaviors. At one point, Sophia even tells Dorothy she's grateful that Dorothy doesn't treat her the way Rose treats Alma.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>: Parodied in "Henny Penny: Straight, No Chaser." Rose, Blanche, and Dorothy play Henny Penny, Goosey Loosey, and Turkey Lurkey in a grade school production, and Rose hates the ending in which the characters are eaten by Foxy Loxy. At the conclusion of the performance, she rushes back onstage and tells the children that they can choose to save the characters if they applaud. None of the kids do it, and Rose resorts to insulting the children and threatening them with bad dreams as Dorothy and Blanche drag her off.<div class="indent"><strong>Rose</strong>: There are <em>monsters</em> hiding under <em>all of your beds!</em></div><ul><li> In "A Midwinter Night's Dream," Blanche tells Dorothy that on a leap year's full moon, men are easy pickings&mdash; "Anything can happen if you just <em>believe</em>!"<div class="indent"><strong>Dorothy</strong>: <em>(clapping her hands)</em> Ooh, I do believe!

A few&mdash;including "The Way We Met," "Mother's Day" and "Valentine's Day"&mdash;actually subverted the usual trend of these episodes by providing all-new vignettes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckooland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckooland">Cloudcuckooland</a>:<ul><li> St. Olaf, Rose's hometown. Dorothy once referred to it as "The Cradle of Idiocy." We never actually see the town in all its glory. The closest we come is seeing the inside of Rose's old house in one flashback sequence (a monologue, so no other St. Olafians actually appear). The girls manage to make it to the outskirts of town in another episode; it's apparently only accessible by horse-and-buggy and by toboggan.<ul><li> This was mentioned as such with Rose's cousin Sven. When he mentions not knowing much about women, Blanche says, "A big strong man like you? Get out of here!" He simply picks up his suitcase and leaves. When Rose chases after him saying that was just an expression, Blanche turns and says to Dorothy, "I never thought I'd say this, but I think Rose got the brains in that family."</li></ul></li><li> In-universe, Sicily is portrayed as a land of nothing but goats, animal dung, and vendettas. Sophia mentions the number two export out of her village was piano wire, but can't remember the first.

Dorothy explains how damaging verbal abuse can be. But the episode ignores that the show has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Dorthy constantly put down by her mother Sophia</a>, which is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">played for laughs</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdTurkeysAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdTurkeysAreEverywhere">Cold Turkeys Are Everywhere</a>: When Dorothy relapses on her tobacco addiction due to the stress brought on by Sophia's marraige, she resolves to quit the addiction a second time.

Fortunately Rose saves the day by buying another cheesecake while out shopping.</li><li> Cookies. In particular, Blanche has been shown to be quite fond of Chips Ahoy! on more than one occasion. And in the episode "Feelings," Sophia remarks, after Dorothy refuses to cave in regarding a failing grade that would keep one of her students from playing in a crucial football game, that in all her life she's never been prouder of Dorothy...<div class="indent"><strong>Sophia:</strong> Can you believe it?

Dorothy in general isn't a woman to be screwed with, due to her complete willingness to resort to her wit to put someone in their place; Blanche punches out an aggressive fisherman when he lays his hands on Rose during a protest; Rose is remarkably great under pressure; and Sophia has implied current ties to the mafia.

Blanche doesn't see him before he passes, and she feels guilty for putting herself before him. Of course, it doesn't make much sense for her father not to tell his own daughter that he's dying, but if he had told her, she would have visited (Blanche is selfish, but it's hard to believe she wouldn't rush home if she knew he was terminally ill) and there would have been no conflict.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>: Mentioned as threats.<ul><li> Blanche once tells Sophia that either she goes along with Blanche's young-age pretense or she gets slapped with a big rent raise.</li><li> In another episode, Sophia makes Dorothy talk about her gambling addiction relapse with her on the threat that, if they don't discuss it right away, they'll talk in her bedroom after Sophia eats a bowl of chili.</li><li> Dorothy threatens to cut off Sophia's Metamucil supply if she comments on the conversation between her and a failing student.</li><li> Everybody used Rose's famous St. Olaf stories as a punishment, including Rose herself. Once, when Dorothy and Blanche try to use lame excuses to duck out on one, she threatens to follow them to their room and act out the story with sock puppets. In another, when Sophia is considering helping a friend commit suicide, Dorothy encourages Rose to tell a story, and then after the story is over, she turns to Sophia and says, "You see what happens.

The plot has Blanche give the other three girls homemade calendars titled "The Men of Blanche's Boudoir," featuring pictures of some of Blanche's lovers. As a joke, some of the male members of the show's staff posed in exaggerated erotic positions while either nude or half-nude, took photographs, and filled the prop calendars with them. When the actresses rehearsed the scene and discovered the gag, they completely lost all composure.<ul><li> In-universe, when Rose tells the "herring war" story from her past to Dorothy and Blanche that they, they find it so outrageous that they burst out laughing. Another time, Rose tells of the time a man known as the Aqua Midget had a crush on her&mdash; Blanche keeps making puns and Dorothy tries to stifle her, but their faces give it all away.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser">Crossdresser</a>: Dorothy and Sophia regularly reference Dorothy's brother Phil's penchant for wearing women's clothes.

Rose has Dorothy and Blanche as guests on a talk show panel that she's arranged, which turns out to be about "Lesbian Lovers of Miami." When the girls take her to task for this, Rose says she didn't know it was going to be lesbian-themed: the producers asked for "two women who love each other and sleep together," pointing out there have been incidents where they've shared a bed and thus <em>slept</em> together before.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>: There are <em>many</em> comparisons between these four and the four from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a></em>.<ul><li> Bea Arthur took exception whenever someone described Dorothy Zbornak as an Expy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maude">Maude</a> Findlay, since she felt she played the two characters very differently.</li><li> Arthur initially balked at signing up for <em>Golden Girls</em> since she wasn't interested in doing, in her words, "Maude and Vivian Meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">Sue Ann Nivens</a>."

It's usually unclear if she's lying or joking, her memories have <em>really</em> been twisted by old age, or both. Among other things, she's claimed to have had affairs with Pablo Picasso (she ended it when she was offended by his portrait of her) and Sigmund Freud (Sophia recalls that he loved to drive through tunnels), to have been friends and business partners with Mama Celeste until they fought over a man, to have been a contestant on a game show called <em>Torture</em> that was hosted by Mussolini, to have caused the Yalta Conference (which was apparently actually convened by FDR, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin to determine which of them loved her the most), and to have been present at the Valentine's Day Massacre with her husband and father when their car broke down in Chicago (although she does concede that it might have just been <em>a</em> Valentine's Day Massacre.)</li><li> Since the entire main cast is over 50, the others all engage in this to a lesser extent. For example, Andy Rooney wanted to have an affair with Blanche but she turned him down, and Rose's high school history teacher may or may not have been Adolf Hitler after he faked his death and was hiding under an alias. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Rose's high school gym teacher openly went by Eva Braun.</a></li><li> Humorously averted with both Sophia and Blanche.

But Dorothy continues to see him...because despite appearances, he's the best lover she's ever had, to the point where they do nothing but have sex when they're together ("We don't go to dinner, we don't go to the movies&mdash;we just go to bed").

During the weekend, an expensive ceremonial plate that Blanche received for the social event ends up broken; Rose and Sophia manage to find a new one, but it ends up costing Sophia all of the money she's made.

In one episode, when talking to her daughter, she mentioned how, when said daughter was a baby, she would have to go downstairs in the middle of the night to scream for the governess when she was crying, implying she lived at her family home of Hollingsworth Manor and her Miami home was a retirement property. However, when considering selling shares of the house to the other girls, she's initially reluctant because she claims it was the house where she raised her children.</li><li> Even an element as simple as the characters' <em>names</em> are inconsistent. In the pilot, Blanche's last name is Hollingsworth. In the entire rest of the series, it's Devereaux (Hollingsworth is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into being her maiden name). Rose's maiden name is well-established as Lindstrom, but a notorious goof in the Bob Hope episode gives her parents the name Nylund, her <em>married</em> name. In two episodes, Blanche is given two different middle names, in each case strongly implied to be her <em>only</em> middle name: Marie and Elizabeth (the second was chosen so that her initials would form the word "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">B.E.D.</a>").</li><li> Dorothy's children are a great big continuity error. It is stated numerous times that she had to drop out of high school because she got pregnant, was married for 38 years, then divorced two years before the show began, meaning she should be 57 with a child near or over 40. Yet whenever Kate and Michael appear on the show, both are in their 20's. It can't even be claimed that Dorothy has an unseen third child, because Stan's third wife explicitly states that Dorothy raised two children.</li><li> Rose's love interest Miles Weber is initially shown to have a grown daughter living in Miami, who does not approve of his relationship with Rose at first, because she believes he is still too vulnerable after his wife's death. Later, however, Miles is revealed to be in the witness protection program, living in Miami under an alias, and all of his relations reside in his hometown of Chicago.</li><li> Rose mentioned almost any honor she competed for as being "her town's highest honor." She claimed this about Butter Queen, St. Olaf's Woman of the Year, and Small Curd Cottage Cheese Queen (well, after Large Curd Cottage Cheese Queen.)</li><li> An early episode had Dorothy and Sophia playing cards for money. Later, in "All Bets Are Off", Dorothy is revealed to have a gambling addiction and isn't supposed to do any gambling at all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny">Never Mess with Granny</a>: By the end of the series, all four Girls were grandmothers (or in Sophia's case, a great-grandmother)... and all four repeatedly proved that they were <em>not</em> to be trifled with.<ul><li> In one episode, Dorothy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">calmly</a> tells the prejudiced Barbara Thorndyke to "go to Hell."

She once saved a teddy bear that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a> was keeping from her by ripping said bear from the girl's arms and shoving her out the door. Rose also stood up to notorious grump Frieda Claxton and told her to "drop dead"&mdash;unfortunately, poor Frieda was so stunned by Rose's outburst that she <em>did.</em></li><li> Though Blanche hated the idea of being a grandmother (it made her feel old), she still showed her mettle when necessary. During a protest to save dolphins from tuna fishermen, she laid a guy flat with a single punch; she once hit a home run without even trying at the batting cages; and she wasn't afraid to lay down the law with her children when she saw that her grandson was being neglected.</li><li> And, of course, Sophia was probably the least afraid to get her hands dirty. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">smacked</a> Blanche's unruly grandson across the face when he mouthed off to her, and, upon discovering that her boyfriend was cheating on her, laid into him with her purse (she had some backup from her sister Angela on that one).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayThatAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayThatAgain">Never Say That Again</a>: Both of the series' primary storytellers got this one.<ul><li> "Blanche's Little Girl":<div class="indent"> <strong>Rose:</strong> It's like something that happened back in St. Olaf...</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Dorothy:</strong> Oh Rose, STOP!

Blanche spends much of the episode uneasy because Rebecca doesn't have a husband to support her, and disagrees with Rebecca's decision to deliver her baby at a birthing center. Rebecca changes her mind when she visits the birthing center and hears the painful screams of the women in labor, and she has her baby girl, Aurora, in a hospital room, with Blanche by her side.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewscasterCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewscasterCameo">Newscaster Cameo</a>: Rose's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a> in "A Letter to Gorbachev" features an appearance by former NBC newscaster Edwin Newman, playing himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsTravelsFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsTravelsFast">News Travels Fast</a>:<ul><li> Invoked by Rose in "Old Boyfriends"; after Rose reveals she had 56 boyfriends in high school, Sophia walks into the room looking for advice on men and immediately goes to her instead of Blanche.</li><li> When the group is arrested for suspicion of prostitution, Rose gets upset that her reputation would be damaged if the news of her arrest made its way back to her hometown of St. Olaf.

Sophia was in her early 80s for the entire seven-year run. Dorothy was <em>about</em> 60 (and consistently <em>over</em> 60 in later seasons). Rose was 55 in the first season, but her age was hard to pin down after that. But Blanche was the most famous example - nobody ever figured out her actual age. She usually claimed to be around 40, and in one episode where the girls tried to find out, she said 42 - which was presented as an obvious lie. They discover that even her birth certificate has been blanked "by order of the Governor". She seems to be younger than the rest of the girls (Rue McClanahan was in fact ten years younger than the other three), and is still fertile when the show starts (hitting menopause in an early episode), so 50-ish seems about right. The Mother's Day episode mentions that she was a senior in high school in 1949 (in America, she would be 17-18 for this), which would put her as <em>roughly</em> her mid to upper 50s for the duration of the show and near 60 at its conclusion.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalBackspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalBackspace">Verbal Backspace</a>: Quite often.

She's also diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (after a number of doctors initially dismiss it as just age or laziness) &#151; Truth in Television, as this had happened to one of the writers, and Dorothy's "The Reason You Suck" Speech to her doctors seems much like a Character Filibuster &#151; but a completely understandable one.</li><li> Sex-loving Blanche struggles to deal with her brother's homosexuality, menopause, a sexually exploitative professor, and an emotionally abusive boyfriend (who she only dumps after he hurts Dorothy). She also has to deal with the ramifications of her hands-off parenting and how it's affected her children and grandchildren.</li><li> Sweet, slightly prudish Rose is the one who goes through an AIDS scare, a drug addiction, and the aftermath of a house robbery. The AIDS episode both lampshades and deconstructs the assumption that it would be happening to Blanche instead. There was also the episode aired during the Cold War, where she becomes afraid of nuclear war, writes to Gorbachev, and nearly gets invited to Russia because they think she's a child writing about it.</li><li> Sophia, the Cool Old Lady and Mama Bear, dealt with issues afflicting people in her age group. She befriendz a man with Alzheimer's, talks a sick, old, lonely woman out of suicide, tries to break a (slightly senile) friend out of a substandard nursing home and care for her, deals with her estrangement from her cross-dressing son Phil and his untimely death, and eventually gets over her animosity toward her daughter-in-law.</li><li> If it didn't happen to the main cast, the VSE would center around a new one-time character. Examples include Ross's blind sister Lily who had to learn independence, Dorothy helping a hippie with agoraphobia, and one of Dorothy's favorite students almost being deported.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriasSecretCompartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriasSecretCompartment">Victoria's Secret Compartment</a>: After the girls believe to have lost the tickets to the game show they travelled to Hollywood to appear on due to their purses being stolen, Sophia is revealed to have kept the tickets safe in her bra.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>:<ul><li> Dorothy and Stan typically have this interaction with one another; despite Dorothy's anger at Stan, and Stan's ineptitude, the two <em>do</em> care about one another.

Granted, Rose had been very badly frazzled by the ordeal and the waiting, but Blanche was justifiably angry because Rose made it sound like this situation should have been happening to someone like Blanche and not her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: An implied version in "The Auction." Sophia fully supports the girls' plan to purchase an original Jasper DeKimmel painting due to his imminent death (which only they know about, thanks to Sophia herself volunteering at the hospital where he's being treated), and even encourages them when they start to have doubts; she explains that since the doctors can't find anyone with DeKimmel's rare blood type, they might as well use the opportunity. However, once she learns (off-screen) that <em>she</em> is a match, she ultimately decides to make the donation, presumably deciding that as long as she was able to help, she had to do so.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a>: Several.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference">Whole Plot Reference</a>: A fairly obscure one - one episode has Sophia plot to win money by managing a boxer who is also a talented violinist that is afraid of injuring his hands in a fight. The protagonist of the 1937 play and 1939 movie <em>Golden Boy</em> was a boxer and violinist who faced the same dilemma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">Wholesome Crossdresser</a>: Dorothy's brother Phil.<ul><li> Blanche's baseball-playing boyfriend Stevie, in the final season episode "Where's Charlie?", becomes one after Blanche makes him wear lingerie while playing for her own enjoyment.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoopeeCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoopeeCushion">Whoopee Cushion</a>: Sophia decides to pull pranks on her housemates after being on the recieving end of a prank by someone else. She places one of these on a chair, embarrassing Dorothy and Blanche when they sat on it (Blanche especially, after making comments about herself being "graceful and sophisticated"). To top it off, Sophia knew how not to set it off herself if she sat on it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitlessProtectionProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitlessProtectionProgram">Witless Protection Program</a>: This turns out to be the case with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose's boyfriend Miles</span>, as he was really a mob witness named Nicholas, on the run from a boss named The Cheeseman. Later he returns with a new identity as an Amishman, only for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose's new boyfriend</span> to be the Cheeseman, recognizing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miles</span> and holding everyone hostage until their neighbor, a cop, comes in to save them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WondrousLadiesRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WondrousLadiesRoom">Wondrous Ladies Room</a>: Parodied in an episode where Rose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInTheBathroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInTheBathroom">locks herself in a bathroom stall</a> at a high-end venue. The washroom consits of an elaborate lounge outside of the bathroom stalls with a large, circular sofa in the center. When Rose's date enters to see what the trouble is and is informed that he is in the ladies room, he mistakes the sofa for an extremely large toilet and remarks that guests must be asked to "stand back" when it is flushed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark">World of Snark</a>: Usually Dorothy and Sophia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Most of the time</a>, Rose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AskAStupidQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AskAStupidQuestion">asks a stupid question</a> and Dorothy gives her a sarcastic answer. But even Rose and Blanche have a snark moment or two in some episodes.<ul><li> In one episode, Rose walks out of her room carrying two buckets in her hands and Dorothy asks if the ceiling in her room is leaking, too.<div class="indent"><strong>Rose:</strong> No, Dorothy, I just finished milking the cow I keep in my closet! <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>]</em> Gee, with only 3 hours of sleep I can be as bitchy as you!</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>:<ul><li> Throughout the series, Dorothy stated that she and Stan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">who got married in their teens because she was pregnant</a>) had been married for 38 years, and divorced two years before the beginning of the series. Her son, Michael, varies in age between 23, 29, and 30 (and not in that order, either!), while <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">the two actresses</a> who play her daughter Kate appear to be no older than their late twenties.</li><li> There were various indications that Dorothy and Stan had married in the late 1940s or even the early 1950s when Dorothy became pregnant; the series starts two years after their divorce in 1985, not quite the full 38 years as was consistently stated by Dorothy.</li><li> The most egregious instance of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> comes in season three when a now 23-year-old Michael becomes engaged to 44-year-old Lorraine; the resulting dilemma is hilariously misplaced when one considers that Michael cannot possibly be this young given the aforementioned facts, and his having apparently become six years younger since his last appearance in season two.</li><li> A minor case, but one episode revolves around Dorothy possibly having been switched at birth with the daughter of a family friend, Gina. The issue came to light when Gina took a blood test for an arranged marriage (and we know it is indeed an arranged marriage because Dorothy is also expected to marry the groom.) The plot is resolved when the groom reveals he would marry Gina anyway. There's one <em>slight</em> problem with the whole mess: why the hell would someone Dorothy's age, a post-menopausal, middle-aged woman, be put into an arranged marriage? Given that Gina has been living with her family up until this point, her parents would have literally waited until she was too old to have children to marry her off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: Creator Susan Harris was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and gave it to Dorothy to raise awareness about it, and probably so she could have Dorothy ream out a doctor who said she was just "getting old."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongRestaurant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongRestaurant">Wrong Restaurant</a>: Inverted &mdash; when the girls lose their winning lottery ticket, Rose pleads their case to the lottery commission over the phone in the hopes they can offer a solution. The friendly man on the phone is sympathetic to their plight, but explains that she dialed his Chinese restaurant, not the Florida Lottery, so there's nothing he can do for them in relation to the lost ticket. As consolation, he offers them free egg rolls the next time they visit his restaurant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe">You Have to Believe Me!</a>: In "Little Sister," Rose's sister Holly visits and keeps cutting her out of plans with Dorothy and Blanche, all while claiming that she did pass the messages on to Rose and acting wounded. Rose repeatedly tries to tell Blanche and Dorothy that Holly is manipulating them, but the girls are convinced by Holly's "woe is me" act and assume that Rose is just jealous. Sophia subverts the trope by actually believing Rose from the beginning.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourFavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourFavorite">Your Favorite</a>: For Dorothy, it's lasagna al forno. So much so that Dorothy automatically knows that when Sophia makes it, it's either because someone has died or because Sophia wants a favor from her.</li></ul></div><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeSong">Thank you for being a friend!</a></div></dd></dl>
