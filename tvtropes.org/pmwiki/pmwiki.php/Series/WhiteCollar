It is usually averted with forgeries Neal makes since he does detailed research on the original and makes sure not to use anachronistic materials. This is invoked in one instance when Neal has to make a forgery that is good enough to fool most art experts but has just enough anachronisms that a detailed examination in an FBI lab would reveal that it is a fake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Neal, especially when pulling an unapproved con for someone in need.

Of special note, they at one point assault and poison a man before kidnapping him and threatening him with death if he doesn't incriminate himself (1x10, "Vital Signs"). Not only would the case not hold up in court, but Neal and Peter would go (back) to prison.<ul><li> Another important point is that the cops can't ask another party to do what they cannot themselves do. Bloody hands at arm's length and all that. Neal's activities are all illegal and any evidence obtained thereby would be inadmissible. Over the course of the series, somewhere between 99 and 100 percent of their cases would have been thrown out.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports">Artistic License &#150; Sports</a>: In the episode "Stealing Home", everything about the heist during a Yankees game pretty much seems to be fine, until you see the date of the check handed to Neal, dated "3/7/12." Unless it was backdated, regular season games at the earliest start in late March, and normally at the beginning of April.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthenticationByNewspaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthenticationByNewspaper">Authentication by Newspaper</a>: The kidnappers in "Front Man" use this in their proof-of-life tape.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing">Bad "Bad Acting"</a>: Averted with Mozzie, who is the worst "actor" in the main cast, yet tends to be a just little hammy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a>:<ul><li> In "Payback", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Keller <em>is</em> prevented from killing Peter and making off with a priceless ring...but his primary goal is to break out of jail, and this he accomplishes without a hitch, walking off free and clear at the end of the episode</span>.</li><li> In "Most Wanted", in order get Neal pardoned for fleeing FBI custody, Peter is forced to concoct a plan that requires Collins to win.

In summary, Neal managed to catch the criminal of the week, escape legal punishment for stealing a piece of artwork, avoid taking the rap for the stolen files from the US Marshals' database despite Abigail planting his hairs in their offices, obtain the files on Ellen that the Marshals weren't going to give up, and perhaps most importantly, retained Peter's trust despite not telling him about all the stuff he should have. It gets to the point where Peter isn't even sure if Neal pulled a long con on him, and doesn't know whether he was right to believe Neal when Neal said that Peter's trust was more important to him than Ellen's files on the flash drive were.</span></li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">Batman Grabs a Gun</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMenHateGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMenHateGuns">Neal</a> snaps in this manner when he has a chance to encounter and kill the man who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he believes</span> killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kate</span>.

Several episodes later, Mozzie knocks on Neal's door ten times, with an iambic pattern of stressed and unstressed knocks.</li><li> In <em>Upper West Side Story</em>, Neal and Mozzie are trying to help a teenage boy get a girl to notice him. Neal tells Mozzie that the girl, Chloe, is obsessed with Romeo and Juliet, and compares Mozzie to the helpful old friar trying to bring the lovers together. Mozzie remarks, "Sans vial of poison." Later in that same episode, he has to create a chemical compound for Neal to use as a distraction so he can free Peter from the bad guys. Mozzie hands Neal a small glass bottle and says, "It turns out, I <em>did</em> need a vial."</li><li> When Mozzie first meets Peter, he pretends to be at the house to have drinks and play Parcheesi with June.

"Neal, I've got a better idea. Cream, no sugar." "You have agents for that." "I've got something better, I've got you."</li><li> Also, during the pilot episode, Peter snarks at the Guards that they will not find the escaped Neal with "road blocks and wanted posters." Fast forward to "Free Fall": after framing Neal for a jewel heist, Fowler asks how Peter plans to capture Neal. He deadpans, "with road blocks and wanted posters."</li><li> In the fifth episode of season one, "The Portrait", Neal gets a museum curator to claim a forged painting is the real thing, because the museum wasn't supposed to have the original painting in the first place. In the first season finale, "Out of the Box", Neal helps Elizabeth's event-planning company get a gig at that same museum, because, "I've got a friend at the Channing Museum...he owes me a favor."<ul><li> In the fourth season, they end up at the Channing again, hoping to stop a heist and they spend a moment reminiscing about that case in front of the painting Neal forged.</li></ul></li><li> In "Bad Judgment", Mozzie tells the Burkes that they need to upgrade their wiring. Two episodes later, Peter ends up staying at Neal's place for a few days while the power's out at his house... it's being rewired.</li><li> In "Dentist of Detroit" we see a number of the same cons we saw Neal call to help catch Mozzie's shooter in "Burke's Seven" at Mozzie's slight-of-hand-me-down sale.</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> permanent alias</span> Neal gets in "Scott Free" is <em>Victor Moreau</em>, a callback to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">Kate Moreau</a>.

However, the Raphael that he left with her and the pagers that they used to communicate seem to contradict this.</li><li> The events that occurred between Neal first coming to New York and him getting caught doesn't seem to make much sense. Neal didn't do any of the high level cons before meeting Mozzie. He stuck to basic street cons, and forged a few bonds. No art theft, no heists. Then he met Mozzie and got involved with the long con against Adler. After Adler fled the country, Kate joined Neal and Mozzie. This was supposedly about a year after Neal met Peter for the first time, and they were still in New York. They were pulling some higher level stuff, but nothing like what Neal pulled later. Neal claimed that he started doing the more elaborate stuff after Kate dumped him and he went to Copenhagen with Alex, once he got back to New York. But by then, the FBI had his name, his face, and apparently a lot of other information. They <em>knew</em> he was guilty of bond forgery, and the only reason Neal was able to stay ahead of them was through aliases. They couldn't arrest him because they couldn't find him. But if that's the case, how did they figure out all that other information? And they had to have had some idea at <em>some points</em>, because he was sending them cryptic clues, birthday cards, and cookies, and Peter has mentioned places where he knew Neal was. And where does Sara fit in? How long did he spend on his own? When did he start working with Keller? When did he do half the things that he mentioned in the series? "Forging Bonds" took place eight years after Neal first came to New York. Four years of that were taken up by prison, and maybe another year with the FBI. It's kind of hard to fit everything else we know about Neal's past and his relationship with Peter into the three years that are left.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Cool Old Lady</a>: June, the widow who supplies Neal with exquisite vintage suits and a penthouse apartment in the pilot, knowing full well that he's a con man just out of prison.

However, it subverts this trope for the most part. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Season three however starts off with Neal making plans to escape from the FBI with stolen Nazi plunder. With no hesitation at doing so. The only reason he doesn't get away successfully is because 1) Jones was in danger and 2) the timing was off. And he does not hesitate in figuring his next attempt. So for however likeable Neal is, he's still very capable of deceiving friends and allies if it suits him. And then subverted twice over in, once he thinks about it, he decides he wants to stay legit, only really conflicted because Mozzie doesn't see the point in staying.</span></li><li> Mozzie, however, seems to be a perfectly straight version, except that he wasn't exactly able to make a clean break, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and comes right back as soon as he learns Elizabeth is in trouble.</span> The same thing happens to Mozzie again in Season 5 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's faced with a choice of getting away even though Diana unveiled his identity, or staying and helping Diana give birth to her baby. He stays.</span></li><li> Neal is now on his way to playing the trope straight as he's finally admitted he doesn't feel guilt when he's committing his heists, and he wants to go back to that life again. Once he admitted that to himself, he has absolutely no qualms about stealing the money the Criminal of the Week stole. The previous Neal might have let the FBI confiscate it and return it to the bank, but not this time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">Trailers Always Spoil</a>: The commercials for the back half of Season Two let us know that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mozzie survived his shooting and Sara and Neal end up hooking up</span>.<ul><li> The previews for the Season Four summer finale all but outright stated that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sam is actually Neal's father</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoSigning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoSigning">Tricked Into Signing</a>: In the "Vested Interest" episode, Neal needs to fool Peter into signing a form authorising FBI surveillance but Peter carefully reads anything before he signs it and counts the forms he has signed to check that one hasn't been slipped in. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neal secretly releases Mozzie's pet rat into the office so that everyone is distracted with the rat, Neal can swap out one of the forms Diana gave Peter for his.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyOneGunSalute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyOneGunSalute">21-Gun Salute</a>: A fourth season episode featured a criminal who disappeared following conviction and the forfeiture of illegally gained assets and was presumed dead.
