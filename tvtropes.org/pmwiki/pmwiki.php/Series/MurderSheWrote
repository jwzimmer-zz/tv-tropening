Fischer and the team of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LevinsonAndLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LevinsonAndLink">Levinson and Link</a>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaLansbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaLansbury">Angela Lansbury</a> as mystery writer and amateur detective Jessica Fletcher, who lives in the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine. The series aired for 12 seasons on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a>, from 1984 to 1996.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Ruthlessly formulaic</a>, most of the show's episodes follow a standard format: a murder is discovered, Jessica <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">starts snooping around</a>, the police tell her to let professionals handle things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">she ignores them</a>, then deduces the murderer's identity in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>, and finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">engineers a public confession</a>, frequently by tricking the murderer into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">Just Between You and Me</a>. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding">everybody laughs</a>.

Angela Lansbury has said she'd like to take one more swing at Jessica Fletcher, but no one else has shown interest. Additionally, rumors began in late 2013 that a possible reboot was in the works, with Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer as a "hospital administrator and amateur sleuth who self-publishes her first mystery novel." After a lukewarm reception from fans and Lansbury herself, the idea was shelved.</p><p>An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">amusing interpretation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded in the show, no less</a>, is that there is no better explanation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMagnet">the sheer number of murders the lead character encounters</a> throughout the long run of the series than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe">her involvement in all of them</a>. Indeed, if Cabot Cove alone were really to have suffered that many murders, it would top the FBI national crime statistics by several orders of magnitude. Not only does this one town see more homicides in a year than the entire state of Maine sees in real life, but the town has an estimated murder rate <strong>eighty-six times</strong> higher than the most murderous city in the real world, Caracas, Venezuela. Also, if you're Jessica Fletcher's friend in any capacity but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">an episode regular</a>, you're pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet">doomed either to kill someone or be killed, or be wrongly arrested for being a killer</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">&#147;What is this, the death capital of Maine!?

He is is killed by having a stake driven through his heart. His aversion to sunlight and mirrors turns out to be a case of genetic photophobia, and the killer chose a stake through the heart as a murder method to take advantage of the fact that several locals suspected him of being a vampire.

If the episode doesn't open with a murder and seems to start with a different crime, expect someone to turn up dead later so Jessica has to work through not only the other crimes but a murder as well. There's a few notable exceptions:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Just Another Fish Story"</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Footnote to Murder"</span>: Self-defense.</li><li> "To The Last Will I Grapple With Thee": Suicide made to look like murder to implicate someone else.</li><li> "The Christmas Mystery": Attempted murder; the victim survives.</li><li> "Test of Wills": The victim attempted to take a gun off someone who was attempting suicide and was accidentally shot. The attempt to cover it up may push it into criminal manslaughter territory.</li><li> Inverted in one episode where the victim's death is thought to be the result of medical malpractice and her doctor is about to be either sued for this or arrested for manslaughter/negligent homicide. Further investigation, however, determines that she was poisoned, meaning it <em>is</em> a murder after all.</li><li> "Jessica Behind Bars" subverts this and then plays it straight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The first victim was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltRiddenAccomplice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltRiddenAccomplice">Guilt-Ridden Accomplice</a> who actually committed suicide.

Well, one half, led by hotheaded Kat, want to blast their way out to freedom, while the others want Jessica to find out who really killed Dr. Matthews. Inmate Bertha even mentions that "If any of us had any brains we wouldn't be in this joint," a self-deprecating comment about their criminal pasts.</li><li> possibly most actively seen with recurring character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> Dennis Stanton, who started his side career as a jewel thief as revenge on the insurance company who refused to pay out for the medical treatments that might have saved his beloved wife.

This is so common that it's more unique when the victim actually didn't deserve their fate.<ul><li> In "My Johnny Lies Over the Ocean", the episode's actual murder takes place almost halfway through the storyline, though staged as a suicide by a woman who was trying to reconnect with her biological son and later learned the stress of uncovering his adoption led to his own suicide. In addition, she was also framed as being a stalker who was gaslighting his grieving widow. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As it turned out, she was murdered by her husband who simply married her for her money and had in fact been the person harassing both her son and his widow in an attempt to drive his wife crazy enough that she would <em>appear</em> to have committed suicide.</span></li><li> One episode featured a woman being poisoned to death by her husband, who wants to collect her insurance money and run off with his mistress. At no time is she ever made out to be someone who got what was coming to her, nor is he made out to be sympathetic.</li><li> Played with, then averted: special mention probably goes out to Marge in "Who Killed J.

The assumption for much of "Dead Letter" is that Bud, the victim and also a neglectful (if not outright abusive) husband, was killed in self-defense by his wife's lover when he attacked them out of jealousy and then the building he was in was set on fire to cover it up. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was really murdered because he witnessed the arsonist burning the building. He, an off-duty volunteer fireman, had broken in to put out the flames and make sure there was no one trapped inside, and in the process stumbled onto his killer.</span></li><li> Averted completely in "Menace, Anyone?" The murderer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doris had a psychotic hatred for Carol and tries to kill her by <em>blowing up her car with dynamite</em>, but kills Carol's boyfriend by accident. She later tries planting evidence in Carol's house, and kills a police investigator who arrives moments later by stabbing him to death.</span> It's one of the few times in the series where the killer has absolutely no reasonable chance at defending their actions, because their victims did nothing to provoke them and were simply in the way of their real target.</li><li> "Sing a Song of Murder" featured a mysterious assailant trying to kill Jessica's lookalike cousin Emma.
