The new program, considerably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">darker and more adult-themed</a> than the original, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">discarded the original series' continuity</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">retooled</a> many of the main characters, while keeping many of the original show's themes and technology. Despite initial protests from fans of the original series (including original series' star Richard Hatch, who had long hoped to relaunch the series and reprise his role as Apollo), the new series quickly became one of the most popular programs in Sci-Fi's history, and nowadays is often-considered to be one of the most influential and critically praised science-fiction series of the early twenty-first century. Even Hatch eventually changed his tune, joining the show's cast as political dissident Tom Zarek.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The 2000s series picks up forty years after the end of the first war between the humans and Cylons, in this continuity sentient machines created as soldiers by the human race. As the story begins, the Cylons, now led by a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">artificial humans</a>, launch a surprise nuclear attack that obliterates almost the entire human race. Like the original series, the survivors form a fleet led by <em>Galactica</em> in search of the lost thirteenth colony, Earth, with the subversion here that whether Earth even exists or not is completely unknown to the fleet. Religious symbolism and revelation play a great role in the new series, as the fleet follows signs and omens that may lead them to Earth while wondering whether or not they're just wasting their time. The polytheistic religion of the humans, based on classical Greek/Roman mythology, also comes into conflict with the monotheistic, vaguely Christian faith of the humanoid Cylons, with the occasional dropped hint that both groups are receiving revelation from the same source.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The new series has been favorably compared to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> for its character-driven storylines and for attempting to portray space physics in a realistic manner despite the occasional excess. It has even been the subject of <a class="urllink" href="http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/03/battlestar-galactica-united-nations.html">a panel discussion at the UN<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

In the end, she outlaws abortion via executive order... after the girl has had her abortion and has applied for asylum aboard <em>Galactica</em> so she doesn't have to go back to her parents.

While Adama explicitly states a few times that he's an atheist, he sees no problem with using humanity's faith as a rallying cry (such as in the infamous "So say we all!" scene) and accepting some of Roslin's more irrational endeavors (though he's opposed to them early on and nearly topples her government over it). He comes off as more of a pragmatist &mdash; seeming to accept that faith is necessary for people to have even though he doesn't share it himself.</li><li> Gaius Baltar, an egocentrist who ultimately comes to consider himself a god (or, at least, a prophet). Baltar thinks of himself as an instrument of God (incidentally, the Big G hates it when you call Him that)-he <em>was</em> an atheist, but begins to believe there is <em>something</em> in "The Hand of God"- with the apt final shot of the episode.</li><li> The Cylon Brother Cavil/Number One Model, the only model to reject both the Cylon god and the Lords of Kobol, and the most sadistic and genocidal Cylon model to boot. While Cavil doesn't believe in God, he has no problem with using "God's will" and the "divine plan" to justify a grand agenda which turns out to be based on little more than petty vengeance. Really, he's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> than anything else.</li><li> In a deleted scene we find out that Billy Keikeya was also an atheist, despite being Laura Roslin's aide and most devoted supporter. By then Roslin was having prophetic visions and some people thought she was the messiah; Billy didn't believe in the gods, but he believed in Roslin. Though both scenes which were shot featuring Billy explicitly "confessing" his atheism to Roslin were deleted, you can still pick it up by observing his actions through the show (it's easier to see it once you've been told Billy is an atheist). It's mostly non-verbal &mdash; you see him sort of staring down and looking a little ashamed whenever Roslin rambles about Pythia, and in a couple of his scenes with Dualla, she implies her faith and he awkwardly changes the subject, his facial expression stuck somewhere between tolerance and pity.</li><li> Felix Gaeta's atheism is presented matter-of-factly, if mostly by implication: he has trouble taking Roslin's "visions" seriously, and acknowledges to Adama at one point that he is "not a man to look for religious explanations" of natural events, however convenient those events might be. His lack of faith in any gods is not considered a problem by other characters at any point.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>: An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example, where Anders and his Caprican resistance are using strategies and tactics they saw in films.

The human Cylons has since put a chip in all non-human Cylons, to prevent them from rebelling against their enslavement. In Season 3, they have occupied the human settlement and can't understand why the humans won't befriend them, while they are writing out deathlists and keeping them enslaved.

Adama explains how water, of all things, is not an issue, as the Galacta's recycling system is nearly 100% efficient, and its storage tanks huge. Two minutes later, it's all gone), and execute borderline suicidal tactics to get food.

Additionally, "Natalie" itself means "birthday," and Natalie ushered in a new era of Cylon-human interaction.</li><li> In Greco-Roman myth, Hera is the wife of Zeus, and is therefore the queen of the Olympians.

This leader shall suffer a wasting illness and die before setting foot on the promised land." <br></div><ul><li> This prophecy is used, along with another given by the Basestar Hybrids concerning Kara Thrace (as recorded below), to help drive the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>.

He subsequently wrote a long rant about all the problems the series had, notably the lack of continuity, reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a> to solve everything, and failure to accurately depict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> without a consistent source of supplies on a long, grueling voyage to reach home. He then produced this series, incorporating most of his suggested changes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> along the way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>: Military jargon more than sci-fi-isms.

In fact, Caprica-Six's faction of Cylons wanted to create a lasting peace with the New Capricans in the Season 2 finale, but their benevolent intentions were unfortunately hijacked by Cavil's faction and instead turned into a brutal occupation regime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">We Used to Be Friends</a>: Kara and Lee.

The scarcity of advanced equipment means humans in the Fleet getting worked to the bone, too. In fact, this "distrust of advanced technology" is part of the reason for why <em>Galactica</em> looks the way she does, as she had no networked computers due to her age as a warship (which had the unseen boon of making her effectively immune to the Cylons' first strike on the Twelve Colonies).

The argument soon evolves into a brawl, but this view is shared by Zarek's supporters as well as Zarek himself, and his ability to market himself as a heroic, populist figure sways nearly half of the fleet (though Dualla, who's also from Sagittaron, is disgusted by the support he gets, feeling there's no justification for what he did, not even if it was supposedly in the name of their world's freedom).</li><li> In Season 3 during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, Colonel Tigh flatly states "Which side are we on?
