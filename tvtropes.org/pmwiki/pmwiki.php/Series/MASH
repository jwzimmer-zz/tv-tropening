It was the final episode for both Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) and "Trapper" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), and the tragic shock ending&mdash;Henry's plane home is shot down; "there were no survivors"&mdash;delineated the line between "Funny <em>M*A*S*H</em>" and "Dramatic <em>M*A*S*H</em>", as many fans would later divide the series. The fourth season proved crucial to the show's long-term success; at the time, very few shows had ever lost such significant characters and kept the audience. But the creators' decision to replace Henry and Trapper with completely different character types in Colonel Potter (Harry Morgan) and B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell) succeeded, and the show continued to enjoy high <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ratings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ratings">ratings</a> and critical acclaim.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Character development often came first in the "Dramatic <em>M*A*S*H</em>" phase. Previously one-note characters such as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) became more sympathetic and complex, as seen in Season 5's "The Nurses", in which Margaret asked her nurses, "When did one of you ever even offer me a lousy cup of coffee?" This approach ultimately led to Frank Burns (Larry Linville) leaving the show by receiving a psychiatric discharge, as the writers had developed Burns as a wholly unlikeable character with no room for growth.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07a8d');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note07a8d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07a8d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Linville actually chose to leave after his initial five-year contract was up, despite having been offered another two years. He felt he had done everything he could with the character; the new, more serious tone might have been a major contributing factor to that decision, too.</span> Burns was replaced by Charles Emerson Winchester III (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidOgdenStiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidOgdenStiers">David Ogden Stiers</a>), who not only proved to be an actual asset to the medical staff, but even (eventually) became a nicer guy...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">in his own way</a>.</p><p>Other ways in which <em>M*A*S*H</em> changed how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom">Sitcom</a> was perceived was by the use (or disuse) of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack">Laugh Track</a>, commonly imposed by the networks if a studio audience would not be present at an episode's filming. The show's creators grudgingly accepted the laugh track, but soon imposed rules on when it was not to be used (during any of the operating room scenes); they dropped it entirely in certain nontypical episodes, and eventually abandoned it entirely. (The laugh track was never used when the series was broadcast by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> in the UK, and the DVDs on both sides of the pond offer the option to watch the shows with or without it.)</p><p><em>M*A*S*H</em> revolutionized the use of camera movements and editing styles on television&mdash;one example is the use of long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrackingShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrackingShot">tracking shots</a> moving with the action (usually of soldiers being moved from helicopter/bus/Jeep to the OR). The show also experimented with unusual storylines married with different camera moves and screen devices. One special camera technique, Boom Up and Over, was new to television at the time; the use of this technique in sequences where camp announcements were shown from the "perspective" of the loudspeaker was groundbreaking and memorable.</p><p>Critics and fans note that the show did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a> very well by keeping the tone of the show consistent while experimenting with unusual storylines or storytelling techniques. "Hawkeye" is a 25-minute monologue by Hawkeye as he struggles to stay awake after suffering a head injury. In "Point of View," the entire episode is literally seen through the eyes of a wounded soldier via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam">P.O.V. Cam</a>. "Life Time" is told in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime">Real Time</a>, with a clock in the corner ticking off the minutes as the doctors race to replace a soldier's crushed aorta before he becomes paralyzed. The series also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeverDreamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeverDreamEpisode">Fever Dream Episode</a>, the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryEpisode">Documentary Episode</a> told as a series of (largely improvised) television interviews with the characters.</p><p>For twenty-five years, the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">final episode</a>&mdash;"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen", which aired on February 28, 1983&mdash;held the record for the most-watched single broadcast in U.S. television history, with a 60.2 rating (percent of households watching), a 77 share (percent of households watching, <em>of those watching some program at that time</em>), and a total audience of over 125 million viewers.

Potter, was able to command a lot more respect and thus appear (and be) more in charge.<ul><li> Henry was a bit of a mix between varieties 1 and 4 of this trope: He was a genuinely nice guy most of the time, and meant well, but had no idea how to run things, and would openly defer to his subordinates whenever any administrative decision had to be made.

Neither of those movies were released during the Korean War (<em>Gojira</em>: 1954/<em>Godzilla, King of the Monsters</em>: 1955, <em>The Blob</em>: 1958).<ul><li> Another borderline case of this is with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMoonIsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMoonIsBlue">The Moon is Blue</a></em>: The movie was released on July 8, 1953 and was still in first-run release in the US by the time the war "ended" on July 27, 1953. While it's within the realm of possibility that the unit could have seen it, it seems highly unlikely given two reasons: The episode revolved around the MASH wanting to see the movie to see what all the fuss was about, which most likely wouldn't have happened till the film was very close to release or already released; and transit times for movies to the Korean Front. If by plane, it might be plausible.</li><li> In "Movie Tonight", Radar shows off his impression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>, but the line he quotes ("I'm not gonna hit ya, I'm not...the Hell I'm not!") is lifted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/McLintock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/McLintock">McLintock!</a></em>, which was released in 1963.</li></ul></li><li> When Radio Tokyo is playing on the camp loudspeakers, it&#146;s often playing Ky&#363; Sakamoto&#146;s &#147;Ue o Muite Aruk&#333;,&#148; otherwise known as &#147;Sukiyaki.&#148; While notable for being one of the first Japanese songs to gain popularity in the West, it wouldn&#146;t be released until 1961.</li><li> In the episode "Der Tag," Radar is shown sleeping with a copy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> comic book on his chest, with the 1970s logo. One shot later, it switches to another issue of the same comic with the '60s logo. Either way, the Avengers weren't around during the Korean War (in fact, none of the major characters from the Marvel Universe had even been <em>created</em>, other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>). In "The Novocaine Mutiny," Radar is shown possessing a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> comic book. Spidey wouldn't be created until 1962.</li><li> The "points" system referenced in some episodes was no longer current for rotation of personnel, nor was it ever used for surgeons.<ul><li> According the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-stale/stale.htm">U.S. Army Center of Military History<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &#147;&#133;a soldier earned four points for every month he served in close combat, two points per month for rear-echelon duty in Korea, and one point for duty elsewhere in the Far East&#133;The Army initially stated that enlisted men needed to earn forty-three points to be eligible for rotation back to the States, while officers required fifty-five points. In June 1952 the Army reduced these requirements to thirty-six points for enlisted men and thirty-seven points for officers.&#148;</li></ul></li><li> B.J.'s latter-seasons hairstyle was <em>much</em> longer than what any professional man in the 1950s, military <em>or</em> civilian, would have worn. (This may be excusable, since the whole point was that B.J. was rebelling against the Army.)</li><li> Several times, Korean soldiers are shown with AK-47-type rifles (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_Series)#Valmet_M71">actually stand-ins<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) before any communist nation even issued them yet.</li><li> In one episode Klinger hands out Hershey bars with UPC symbols on the back wrapper to recovering patients.</li><li> A pinball machine from the 1970s appears in the Officers' Club, along with a poster on the wall with an illustration of a Vietnam-era helicopter.</li><li> In one episode Henry uses a bullhorn that wasn't invented until after the war.</li><li> In "Officer of the Day," Flagg appears wearing the branch insignia for military intelligence. This insignia wasn't used by the Army until 1962.</li><li> Medics are always shown wearing helmets with the Red Cross painted on the front. This practice was stopped in early 1951 because North Korean snipers were using them as targets.</li><li> General MacArthur is almost constantly referred to as the Allied Commander. MacArthur was relieved of command in April 1951 for insubordination, after less than a year in command.</li><li> In the episode "War of Nerves", Sidney Freedman asks Radar, "Do you know how many people...think <em>I Love Lucy</em> is real?" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> premiered in October of 1951. Given when the characters were supposed to have been in Korea, there is no way that either of them would have ever seen the show.</li><li> In one episode, Klinger, the surgeons, and Margaret are all playing poker. Margaret buys Klinger's hoop earrings off him so he can stay in the game, and Klinger mentions he'd wear hula hoops in his ears if he thought it'd get him out of the Army. Later in the series, he technically invents the hula hoop (or at least decides to patent it so he can make money). The hula hoop wouldn't be officially invented until 1958.</li><li> You know that wool cap that Radar always wears? It's called a Jeep Cap, and it's actually a uniform accessory from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, not the Korean War; in fact, Patton and other American officers hated the Jeep Cap because it looked "sloppy" and "unmilitary" that it was eventually replaced with the standardized field cap before WW2 ended. It was only after Radar made the Jeep Cap famous that the U.S. Army started to issue them again as surplus, though they look nothing like they used to.</li><li> In one episode Hawkeye can be seen wearing bright blue '70s tennis shoes while walking through the compound.</li><li> Noted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em>'s parody "M*U*S*H" (not to be confused with the one mentioned below) when Luke-Warm Lips's appearance is commented on thusly: "This is 1950 and she's wearing a hairdo that won't even be invented until 1981!"<ul><li> Several actresses from the period can be seen in glamor shots with roughly similar styles to Margaret's season 5 and 6 look. However (as Klinger would tell you) a side part was more common. Parting down the middle is a very '60s look, and the feathered style of the last seasons didn't come in until the mid-'70s.</li><li> However, the halter top Margaret wears in "The Merchant of Korea" and a couple of other hot-weather episodes is not out of place. The Chinese <em>dudou</em>, popular all over East Asia, has been around since at least the 14th century CE; Margaret looks to have made hers from an Army undershirt, perhaps after seeing locals wearing them.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalLover">Animal Lover</a>: Walter O'Reilly tends to a small menagerie of animals in the camp and once saved a lamb from being made into lamb chops.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Parody</a>: Filmation's <em>M*U*S*H</em>, a segment of the Saturday Morning Kid's Show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UncleCrocsBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UncleCrocsBlock">Uncle Croc's Block</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnonymousBenefactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnonymousBenefactor">Anonymous Benefactor</a>: Charles, in "Death Takes a Holiday".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnticipator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnticipator">The Anticipator</a>: Radar has the uncanny ability to appear at the side of his commander before he even asks for him, as well as finish his sentences.

He then clarifies, "And if we don't die, whites are 25&cent;, reds are 50&cent;, and blues are a dollar."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologyGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologyGift">Apology Gift</a>: Happens several times over the course of the series.<ul><li> In one episode, Hawkeye and Trapper try to butter Frank up with a handful of wild flowers, after they secretly drew a pint of blood from him to give to a wounded POW; Frank is touched, but then they kill the moment when Hawkeye says, "Glad there's no hard feelings Frank, because there's a new heart procedure we'd like to try, and you're just the right type."</li><li> During a company picnic, Margaret gives Frank the cold shoulder since he won't loan her money to buy her sister a wedding present; Frank tries to butter her back up with a balloon, only for her to pop it with a hairpin.</li><li> In another episode, Frank tries to make peace with Margaret (this after she had gotten engaged earlier in the season), by presenting her with an American-made Japanese umbrella; of course, Frank isn't able to curb his lust, and Margaret throws it at him as he runs out of her tent.</li><li> In "The Winchester Tapes", Charles apparently had upset Radar, and insincerely brings him an entire case of grape Nehi to butter him up in order to contact his former commanding officer to get him transferred back to Tokyo General Hospital. When Radar refuses, Winchester takes the case back. And then he takes the one bottle that Radar had opened.</li><li> Then there's the one time the gift is actually accepted. In one Christmas episode, most of the staff have been giving Charles the cold shoulder for his unwillingness to donate to the Christmas potluck, despite having received several huge packages from home. When Klinger finds out why &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the packages were filled with expensive chocolates that Charles was planning to give to the children at the local orphanage as part of a family tradition</span> &mdash; he brings Charles a plate of leftover food and they share a heartfelt moment over it.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>:<ul><li> Sidney Freedman's advice in an early appearance and the final episode: "Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice. Pull down your pants and slide on the ice."</li><li> Count how many times Hawkeye refers to both babies (including a lot of jokes about getting pregnant) and chickens. It amounts to a lot in eleven seasons before the finale.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>: Several episodes deal with patients who lost limbs in battle and are coming to grips with the results. One episode showing Charles' better side dealt with a patient who didn't actually <em>lose</em> a limb, but sustained nerve damage to several fingers that, since he was a gifted, Juilliard-trained pianist, he believes is just as bad as losing the limb outright.<ul><li> Happens to Hawkeye in a nightmare in which a Medical School Professor ordering the removal of his arms symbolizes his frustration at not being able to save every patient and how he tortures himself about it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedFarces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedFarces">Armed Farces</a>: It's a comedy set in a military camp, so it's to be expected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: "She killed the chicken?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseAwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseAwards">Artistic License &#150; Awards</a>: Several:<ul><li> Frank once browbeats Henry into approving a Purple Heart citation and another time he receives a Purple Heart by mistake. Neither time was he eligible. The first, "Sometimes You Hear the Bullet", he receives a Purple Heart for throwing out his back while dancing, which was not a direct result of combat and, more importantly, would cause him to be discharged; back problems were an automatic medical disqualification from service. The second (based on an incident in Vietnam), "The Kids", he gets a Purple Heart for getting a bit of eggshell in his eye, and putting it in a report as "shell fragment" &mdash; slightly more believable for it to go through in the first place, but by this point, the camp is under the command of Potter, who takes military awards much more seriously and would probably insist that Frank clear up the misconception and return the medal.<ul><li> In both cases, Hawkeye steals Frank's medal and gives it to someone he feels is more deserving: the first goes to an underage Marine with appendicitis who lied about his age to enlist (which would put him in worse trouble, as he has been reported for identity theft and now has stolen property), and in the second, Hawkeye steals it and gives it to a baby who was grazed by a bullet that went through his mother's abdomen shortly before she gave birth. But in addition to the fact that Frank's name would have been on both medals, those particular medals being stolen would have no long-term impact on Frank anyway; he would have been on record as a two-time recipient of the Purple Heart, and could have been issued replacements for the physical medals.</li></ul></li><li> In "Change of Command", Potter reveals he received a Good Conduct Medal as an enlisted soldier. However, he served in the First World War, became a doctor in 1932 and served in the Second World War as a surgeon, while the GCM was established in 1941 and retroactive dates only go to 1940.</li><li> In "Bombshells", B.J. receives a Bronze Star for helping a medivac chopper escape while under fire, but decides to hand it off to a patient for "getting out in one piece". However, every Bronze Star has the recipient's name engraved on the back and comes with a certificate. As with the Marine, this would put him in possession of an undeserved medal that belonged to someone else (albeit this time, it's with the permission of the rightful owner), and it would still be B.J. who was on the record as receiving it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseCars">Artistic License &#150; Cars</a>:<ul><li> In the season three finale, Henry gives Radar the keys to a Jeep, and in "Sometimes You Hear the Bullet" Wendel tries to hotwire a Jeep. Because Jeeps would need to be operated by anyone at any time, all Jeeps had a simple ignition switch instead of a key, something shown somewhat extensively through the series' run. Of course, being a foot soldier he may not have realized that.</li><li> In "Welcome to Korea", Hawkeye asks Radar if a Jeep is olive drab and made in Detroit. Korean War-era Jeeps were made in Toledo, Ohio.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography">Artistic License &#150; Geography</a>:<ul><li> Several references to Korea being in South East Asia, and jungles in Korea.</li><li> In "Iron Guts Kelly", Radar finds a sector under fire and lists the position as, "North of Inchon, latitude 27, longitude 70." Those coordinates are in extreme western India, near the border with Pakistan, over 3000 miles west of Korea.</li><li> In ''Abyssinia Henry", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Henry's plane</span> is reported as shot down over the Sea of Japan, well beyond where any North Korean or Chinese fighter pilots operated, especially in 1952.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety">Artistic License &#150; Gun Safety</a>: see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JugglingLoadedGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JugglingLoadedGuns">Juggling Loaded Guns</a>.<ul><li> Averted at least once in a deleted scene. In "It Happened One Night," Klinger has just introduced Hawkeye to a new private going on guard duty for the first time. After the discussion, Klinger stands. The private picks up his rifle and inadvertently points it in Klinger's face. Klinger is quick to nudge it away, having anticipated the eventuality upon seeing him pick it up. This trope gets played straight later on when (offscreen) the gun goes off, and Klinger is brought into Post-Op, trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">ham up</a> being fatally shot when the bullet barely nicked him.<div class="indent"><strong>Hawkeye</strong>: <em>[as Klinger collapses onto the bed]</em> Would you at least <em>bleed</em>?</div></li><li> Hawkeye in "Hawkeye Get Your Gun." The fact Potter cocks the hammer before Hawkeye starts firing means he must carry it loaded and hammer-down. This is the least safe way to carry a 1911. John Browning specifically designed it to be carried loaded with the hammer cocked (Situation One), and included a sear disconnect, a grip safety, and a manual safety (which can't be activated unless the hammer is cocked). This means for it to fire, the manual safety must be deactivated, the grip must be held, and the trigger must be pulled. This isn't that surprising, given Hawkeye's attitude to guns; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntLikeGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntLikeGuns">Doesn't Like Guns</a> below.</li><li> Frank Burns is a walking example of how to <em>not</em> handle a firearm. Highlights include shooting B.J. in the leg, shooting himself in the foot, and shooting out a light while chambering a round. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> as this is specifically portrayed as a function of his incompetence, not as the correct or appropriate way to do things.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMedicine">Artistic License &#150; Medicine</a>: Many nurses can be seen with long, manicured fingernails. This is prohibited because, among other things, they have to be able to wear gloves during surgery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMilitary">Artistic License &#150; Military</a>: Too many to count, but a few stand out above the others:<ul><li> Frank demands and receives a Purple Heart for getting an eggshell in his eye during an artillery barrage (he claimed he was hit by shell fragments, and omitted the part about the shell in question being an eggshell). In real life, he would have been denied as the injury wasn't directly caused by enemy action. He earlier demanded a Purple Heart for "slipping" on the way to the "shower" (actually a back spasm while dancing with Margaret).</li><li> Potter is correct in stating that the Army Good Conduct Medal is only for enlisted soldiers. He's wrong in insisting that his status as a prior-service enlisted soldier entitles him to wear the medal, which he is seen wearing from time to time and he has his medal framed on his wall. What he (or the writers) failed to realize is that the medal was awarded long after Potter was an enlisted soldier and that the retroactive dates don't go back to when he was enlisted and eligible for the award.</li><li> As a Chaplain, Mulcahy would have entered the military as a Captain, not a Lieutenant.</li><li> Doctors didn't automatically enter service as a captain. There were plenty of surgeons in the war that were lieutenants.</li><li> The Points system was never used for rotation of doctors. It was never used in the Korean War at all. Most of the doctors and nurses spent 12-16 months in Korea, then were sent to Japan or a Stateside Army hospital to finish up their military obligation.<ul><li> Aside from Henry Blake earning enough Points to be discharged, the Point System was a plot point in a later episode, where the peace talks had failed again, but Potter reminds everyone if they receive enough Points, they would be rotated home. Although Hawkeye gripes the most, Charles points out he actually has the least amount of complaining to do as he has more Points than the rest of them. Later still, when Potter breaks the news that the Army upped the number of rotation Points to get transferred back to the states, Hawkeye loses it.</li></ul></li><li> In one episode, the doctors think it's ridiculous that Frank has made them pack up the unit and move it across the road, and in another, General Steele makes them move 20 miles closer to the front. Part of the reason for the unit's existence was to follow the troops into battle so the wounded could be taken care of as quickly as possible. In the early part of the war, MASH units were quite mobile, and it was only in the latter part of the war, when the battle lines stabilized, that they tended to stay put. While Frank's reasoning was absurd, Steele's wasn't, and moving the entire unit quickly wasn't out of the question; in fact it was one of the functions of a MASH.</li><li> Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, just about every character could be charged with a plethora of <em>very</em> serious offenses, and being a doctor would not have saved anyone.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.koreanwar-educator.org/memoirs/secor_harold/index.htm#LifeMash">Somewhat<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, but only somewhat.</li><li> It's likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">The Main Characters Do Everything</a>, but the administrative section of a MASH would have consisted of two Medical Service Corps officers (non-doctors), a warrant officer, a first sergeant, and numerous enlisted men ranging from master sergeant to private, not just one guy named "Radar". Granted, in any military organization there are "go to" guys like Radar that can get stuff done that no one else can, but a unit run by the hospital commander and one company clerk would have fallen apart fairly quickly.<ul><li> It's implied in several episodes that Radar does have underlings, and his <em>chief</em> job is to negotiate and barter with other clerks, though we never see any.</li></ul></li><li> Two different characters go completely bonkers and are quietly promoted and given cushy posts to get them out of the way. The US military was not known for being kind to people who cracked under the stress of war; summary discharge under Section 8 was the usual remedy. The first example is justified as being a general, whose friends probably protected him. The second example, Frank Burns, had no friends, and it is a mystery why anyone would go out of their way to keep him in the Army.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: Klinger started out as a one-shot guest character, and by the fourth season was a series regular.<ul><li> Father Mulcahy, a minor character in the novel and film, initially only appeared every few episodes until he was made a regular.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a>: The cast frequently had William Christopher sound-alike contests between takes.

But Mulcahy had never used that word at any time in the series up to that point. He did afterward, however. For instance, in the episode where Margaret and Donald get married, the men have a bachelor party to celebrate. Mulcahy, while quite intoxicated, exits the Swamp, saying "Even the jocularity is jocular!". (Towards the end of the show's run, he used the term even more frequently.) This is likely a case where the latter scene was either written or shot first, and someone just forgot that the imitation scene was set to air earlier. (Alternatively, there might have been a reference in an earlier scene that was cut.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsianSpeekeeEngrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsianSpeekeeEngrish">Asian Speekee Engrish</a>: This was much more prelevant in the earlier episodes, where the humor was much more sitcomy and hadn't quite matured yet.

There are a number of cases where the characters don't even speak actual Korean, but instead are speaking Chinese. In fact, in two different episodes, the word "Stop" has a completely different translation ("Kuchio" in one episode, "Chung-ji" in another). In another, a Chinese soldier pulls a grenade in the OR and speaks <em>Japanese</em>.<ul><li> The two different words for "stop" thing is actually a genuine attempt to avert this. Korean features a couple of different words that, in any dictionary, would be glossed as "stop".

The camp's stop signs even feature a third word: "meomchum" (&#47688;&#52644;, a nominal form of &#47688;&#52628;&#45796;).

Even with the eventual departures of Gelbart and later Reynolds, comedy was still the show's main focal point, with drama taking a back seat - though the humor itself was also toned down, and became more intelligent and cerebral, as opposed to silly and slapstick. Finally, by Season Eight, the entire writing and producing staff was overhauled by Alan Alda and Burt Metcalfe, causing the show to flip its priorities, and make drama the show's driving force with comedy shunted to the back burner.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">Cerebus Retcon</a>: While a few season 1-3 episodes implied Hawkeye had pre-existing trauma/mental illness, he was mostly alright, and had an alive sister and mother.

From learning the enemy has a new weapon and the new means of treating the wounds, to having to end old friendships when those friends try to lead in the field and end up getting more young soldiers hurt because of their incompetence.</li><li> When Pierce is made Commanding Officer in season 7's opener "Commander Pierce" showed his handling of matters, the fighting of bureaucracy to just get blankets for the wounded, and in addition to his duties as Chief Surgeon. When B.J. leaves without informing him to help an aide station, it leaves Pierce with just him and an ill Charles to work as the surgeons before a large rush of wounded are about to arrive. After it is over, Pierce talks with Houlihan and the following conversation follows:<div class="indent"> <strong>Hawkeye:</strong> Damn that Hunnicutt! Where is he? Technically, he's AWOL, y'know.

By Season 3, he's incredibly na&iuml;ve, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink much, and seems to have regained his virginity. (This actually gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a> by Sidney as being Radar's defense mechanism for dealing with the war: reverting to more childish characteristics to escape the horrors forced on him everyday.)</li><li> Frank fell victim to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> (see below); however, one facet of his character was that Frank wasn't <em>completely</em> against Koreans to begin with. For one thing, he demeaned Hawkeye and Trapper's "corruption" of Ho-Jon, and even seemed sympathetic towards Ho-Jon when it was revealed he was stealing everyone's belongings to sell for bribe money for the border guards to bring his family down from North Korea. He once even implies that he has his own personal Korean houseboy, whom he pays six cigarettes on a daily basis to keep his boots shined at all times. With each passing season, however, Frank's contempt for Koreans (and all foreigners) increases more and more to the point that he doesn't even like a South Korean ping-pong player (who was actually assigned to the 4077th) simply for being Oriental, and disapproves of his wedding to his fianc&eacute;e because the army shouldn't be concerned and tries to attack a South Korean general, mistaking him for a North Korean.</li><li> Father Mulcahy goes back and forth a lot throughout the series. In certain episodes, such as "Mulcahy's War" (S5) or "Dear Sis" (S7), he feels like wasted space and completely useless in a camp where nobody seems to have any need for him (the former, he especially feels he would be more useful on the front lines, where his spiritual comfort would <em>really</em> be needed); other episodes, such as "Hepatitis" (S5) or "An Eye for a Tooth" (S7), he actually does feel like he's of importance to the 4077th - in "Hepatitis", he becomes concerned at the thought of being quarantined from the rest of the camp when people may require Confession or, even more serious, Last Rites, while in "An Eye for a Tooth", he feels that he <em>deserves a promotion</em> for all he's done for the 4077th, and even <em>demands</em> Potter to get I-Corps to give him one, to no avail.</li><li> In spite of Henry's signature outfit consisting of a fishing hat and vest, he was really only a fishing aficionado throughout the first season; afterwards, golf was his activity of choice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a>: Captain Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>: Somehow they had four of these, although there were only three Christmases during the war.<ul><li> "Dear Dad" (Season 1), "Dear Sis" (Season 7), "Death Takes a Holiday" (Season 9), "'Twas the Day After Christmas" (Season 10).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>:<ul><li> Spearchucker Jones (dropped from the series after the makers learned that there's no evidence that any black doctors served in Korea<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6oeqr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6oeqr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6oeqr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The creators were mistaken on there being a lack of black doctors during the Korean War.

One involves a black marketeer who has stolen critically needed medical supplies, one a soldier who swapped dog tags with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony">a friend who died just before the end of his tour of duty</a>, and one, a new doctor who confesses that he's been pretending to be a doctor to get officers' privileges and rank.<ul><li> In one episode a solder who shot himself to get sent home confesses to Frank, mistaking him for a priest while he was in Father Mulcahy's tent to leave him a note.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Trapper:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">You can fool some of the Papal some of the time...</a></div><ul><li> Also note that in the case of the dogtags, Mulcahy was not technically bound by the seal of the confessional.

Hawkeye signs a letter "love to Mom" but it's later revealed that his mother is dead; the writers couldn't keep the name of Henry's wife straight; at one point Margaret states her father is dead, but he shows up alive and well on an episode years later. Granted, Margaret is very drunk when she says it, but one would still expect her to remember which of her parents are living. Frank earlier asked if her father had left her some money, implying that Frank thought he was dead before her drunk reference to his death.<ul><li> Hawkeye initially has a sister, too. And he was originally from Vermont, but is later from Maine. In one episode, he says that his family lives in Vermont and has a summer home in Maine, but this is dropped in favor of making Hawkeye a Maine native.<ul><li> And for some reason he went to a dentist in <em>Detroit</em> (which might be an oblique reference to Painless, who was from Detroit). Not to mention his obsession in one episode with getting barbequed spareribs from his favorite restaurant in Chicago.</li></ul></li><li> Potter originally has a son. Later, he has only a daughter. When his daughter-in-law gave birth, she originally had a daughter. Later, Potter has a grandson, but no granddaughter is mentioned. Also, depending on the episode, Potter was 15 when he joined the Army. At other times, he was already married by the time he joined the Army.<ul><li> Potter could conceivably have been married at the age of 15; the legal age of consent didn't reach 16 in most states until 1920, and though a teenage marriage might have been unusual in the 1910s it wouldn't have been unheard of. He may even have joined the Army to support a young family at the time.</li><li> Potter mentions he joined when the US entered the First World War, but later gives his age as 62, putting his date of birth in 1889 or 1890, which would make him 27 when the US entered the war.</li></ul></li><li> Potter is introduced taking over command of the unit in September of 1952, but later episodes have him present in 1951 or even '50. The timeline seems to be all over the place.</li><li> "The Moon is Not Blue" has a visiting general order that the Officers' Club be closed as it is supposedly against regulations to have a bar serving alcohol at a M*A*S*H. However, the club was original built, in "Officers Only", as a gift from another visiting general.<ul><li> Justified; when the club opened, it had a dedicated bartender, but by the time of this episode it was generally staffed by Igor or Klinger.

Margaret even points out that she assisted when Dr. Borelli taught him the procedure.</li><li> "The Late Captain Pierce" has Hawkeye reference how Trapper went home and Henry was killed.

A few episodes later there's a mail call episode, and the documents arrive for him to do it.</li><li> In season 3's "Checkup", Henry informs Radar that he's going to have to have his tonsils removed eventually; it finally happens in season 7's "None Like It Hot".</li><li> In season 7's "Rally 'Round the Flagg, Boys", while explaining his dislike of Col. Flagg to Charles, Hawkeye says he's "never been too fond of a guy who would bring you a wounded prisoner and beg you to fix him up just so he could take him out and shoot him", referencing Flagg's appearance in season 3's "Officer of the Day".</li><li> While packing his things in preparation of going home in season 8, Radar finds the thermometer that Col. Blake had given him (in "Abyssinia, Henry"). He also finds his Purple Heart and comments on how Hawkeye had saluted him (in "Fallen Idol").</li><li> Radar, Henry, and Trapper are all mentioned in "Period of Adjustment".</li><li> In "That's Show Biz", Brandy mentions that she was once married for three months. Margaret comments that her own marriage ("Margaret's Marriage" through "Peace On Us") was about the same duration.</li><li> The series finale, "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen", has several of them:<ul><li> Hawkeye attempts to compose a "Dear Dad" letter while at the psychiatric hospital.</li><li> Hawkeye laments that B.J. went home without leaving him a note, just as Trapper had done.</li><li> Margaret and Charles re-hash an old argument (from season 6's "War of Nerves") over whether or not he touched his nose in surgery.</li><li> Sidney references an earlier comment he had made (in season 3's "O.R.") with his parting words to the group.</li><li> When saying goodbye to Hawkeye and B.J., Col. Potter mentions their pantsing of Winchester in the O.R. (from season 9's "Bottom's Up").</li><li> Saying goodbye to B.J., Hawkeye says he'll think of him "next time somebody nails my shoe to the floor" (something B.J. did earlier that season, in "The Joker Is Wild").</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedClumsiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedClumsiness">Contrived Clumsiness</a>:<ul><li> On one episode where Hawkeye, B.J. and Charles are on a promotion committee, they evaluate the prospective promotees and give their recommendations.

The Korean War was also his first war and he wasn't that very militant. In contrast, Sherman Potter was a regular Army Man who was part of two previous wars. He also commanded much more respect from the other staffs and wasn't afraid to actually command.</li><li> Frank Burns was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> whose surgery skills were subpar at best. He was also bullied by Hawkeye and Trapper and later B.J..

Hunnicutt is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> example for Trapper John as he functioned very similarly to him. However, B.J. was a family man who loved his wife Peg to the point that he felt ashamed that he cheated on her. In contrast, Trapper constantly cheated on his wife with zero regret for his actions. There was also a contrast in morals. One episode during B.J.'s tenure recycled a plot from an earlier episode with Trapper.

Aside from the familar leads (Hawkeye, Trapper, Henry, Hot Lips, Frank, Radar) the pilot episode has a closing sequence that announces the personnel assigned to M*A*S*H 4077: the list includes Karen Phillip as Lt. Dish (who lasted only one more episode); G. Wood as General Hammond (two more episodes); Timothy Brown as Spearchucker (five more episodes); and Patrick Adiarte as Ho-John (six more episodes). All had major moments in the pilot, and were clearly being set up to be recurring characters &mdash; but they were given little to do in future appearances, and were gone by the end of the first season, if not sooner. Note that the character of Spearchucker was supposedly written out for greater historical accuracy, as the writers claimed there were no records of African-American surgeons serving in Korea. (There were, in fact, black doctors in Korea, and Spearchucker was based on an African-American doctor that Richard Hornberger heard about at the 8055.)</li><li> Odessa Cleveland as Nurse Ginger Bayliss also had a showcase credit at the end of the pilot, and actually stuck around through the early fourth season. But in what was maybe the show's most literal case of Demoted To Extra, Cleveland's occasional appearances on M*A*S*H became shorter and more infrequent over time, and by her last few appearances, she was uncredited and had almost no dialogue.</li><li> Other pilot characters were virtual extras to begin with: Ugly John and Lieutenant Scorch were not really identifiable behind their masks and had very limited dialogue in the pilot. As well, the actors portraying these roles didn't receive any special audio billing in the closing, unlike the other characters intended to be regulars. However, both John and Scorch got a little more development and exposure early in season 1 ... then faded slowly into the background as the season continued.

Hawkeye removes his appendix, but sadly, even without said colonel, the gears of war churn onward.

Mulcahy, out of a sense of respect from pretty much everyone.<ul><li> The notable exception to this trope is Klinger, whose first name, Maxwell, is very rarely used.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixingTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixingTheGame">Fixing the Game</a>:<ul><li> The craps game in the back of Rosie's bar is rigged.</li><li> Frank runs a bookie operation for baseball games that are broadcast to the camp during the day.

Potter's crankiness, and Frank Burns's jerk-assedness (and flakiness, and paranoia) all grew more and more pronounced as the show progressed.<ul><li> In early seasons, Frank showed occasional flashes of human decency. For instance, in season 1's "Sticky Wicket", when Hawkeye re-opens a patient who's failing to get better and discovers he'd overlooked a tiny bit of shrapnel damage, Frank quietly says "Anyone could have missed that." In season 2's "Kim" he tries to help when a little boy runs into a minefield, and in season 3's "O.R." he's horrified to learn he nearly removed a patient's sole kidney. Even as late as season 3 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Henry's death was announced</span>, Frank has tears in his eyes as the camera pans over the OR.

Trapper occasionally exhibited a world-weary pragmatism in contrast to Hawkeye's passionate idealism. B.J. was a devoted family man in contrast with Hawkeye's womanizing. Frank Burns was a jingoistic lover off all things military in contrast with Hawkeye's staunch liberal pacifism.

Also depending on the nature of the episode, the variation of the music cue would differ: while most episodes featured a short, upbeat arrangement of the show's main theme, especially sombre and poignant episodes would either use a slower and more melancholy arrangement or omit the music altogether.

Not only that, but the date given in the season 4 opener (September 19, 1952) means that the last eight seasons of the show take place over only ten months. In fact, later episodes tend to give <em>earlier</em> dates than earlier episodes. So we have Henry at the 4077th in 1952 and "later" Potter is there and it's 1950. Clearly they were stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> &mdash; probably why everyone complained so much about the war never ending.<ul><li> Some explain the change in times with a theory of two <em>M*A*S*H</em> universes, one of which (for example) keeps Henry Blake in charge of the 4077th well into 1952 while the other has him die early in the war. (Some even go as far as to say there is a third <em>M*A*S*H</em> universe where Henry Blake never died and Trapper John left a note saying goodbye.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Event</a>: Maybe not entirely in the background, but if you watch Trapper John in "Private Charles Lamb" while the Greeks are bringing food in the mess tent, he tries to open three or four jars of food while chatting with Radar using his shirt to get a grip on the tight lids. He fails to open even one.<ul><li> In one episode, a colonel is talking to one of his wounded soldiers who is in a full body cast, with only his eyes, mouth, and one hand visible. When the colonel leaves, the man waves his hand goodbye.</li><li> In "Cowboy," as Radar helps Henry to the hospital following the jeep crashing through his tent, Mulcahy moonwalks out of the shot; even the nurse who was standing next to him turns and looks on with a bemused look on her face.</li><li> In "Operation Noselift", Hawkeye stops to talk to Father Mulcahy in the compound. Behind them is a parked jeep in which two soldiers sit, one reading a hard-bound medical reference and the other a comic book, comparing notes.<ul><li> The same episode has a scene where Hawkeye is making a phone call from Henry's office, and Trapper can be seen in the background playing with a Japanese doll on Henry's desk, breaking it, and hurriedly hiding the pieces. (Later, when Hawkeye and Trapper are out in the compound, an angry Henry comes up demanding to know who broke the doll.)</li></ul></li><li> Anytime Hawkeye and Trapper watch Frank walk right into one of their pranks, Trapper <em>cannot</em> keep a straight face.</li><li> There's a recurring stock footage shot of the 4077th compound that has four corpsman doing the Can-Can on the wooden platform near the camp entrance.</li><li> In, "Adam's Ribs," during Hawkeye's tirade in the Mess Tent regarding the poor selection and quality of Army chow, Radar continues to eat, even swiping food off other people's trays.</li><li> In "Dear Dad", during the otherwise tense scene where Mulcahy is trying to talk Klinger out of using a grenade on Frank, watch the background behind Mulcahy.

During surgery, Basgall hurls epiphets at Hawkeye for being a communist sympathizer, to which Hawkeye snaps back and yells at him.

Frank had asked the Father to give a sermon on temperance. However, Mulcahy was uncomfortable with the subject ("The Prodigal Son" and "Turn the Other Cheek" being more familiar territory for him). Needing to calm his nerves, he has a drink from a bottle gifted to him by a grateful soldier.

He browbeats Colonel Blake into accepting the logic that since the 4077 M*A*S*H is officially a front-line military hospital which shares front-line perils like occasional shelling and sniping, his "wound" was sustained on the front lines and thus merits a Purple Heart. Henry grudgingly gives in and writes the citation. Meanwhile, Hawkeye and Trapper are dealing with a real American hero: a fifteen-year-old boy who lied about his age to enlist in the Marines. Hawkeye wrestles with the ethical dilemma about breaching a patient's confidence, but exposes the youth to the Military Police. He is to be discharged from the Marines and sent home to his parents. Hawkeye and Trapper sweeten the pill by stealing Frank's medal and re-presenting it to a soldier who really <em>was</em> wounded in combat.</li><li> Frank claims a Purple Heart because when he cracked open his breakfast egg, some of the eggshell got in his eye. The official medical records read <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">"shell fragment"</a>, and since they're a frontline unit, it counts as a war wound.

Though he is correct that it is unavailable to officers, he served before the medal was established and the retroactive dates only go to 1940.</li><li> Radar is awarded the Purple Heart (presented to him by Hawkeye) when he is wounded by the enemy while on a three-day pass.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityHasNoSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityHasNoSoundtrack">Reality Has No Soundtrack</a>: The show started out playing incidental music throughout each episode like most sitcoms of the era, but starting in Season Two, it was reserved for extended comedy sequences. By Season Eight, it was gone entirely (though music continued to occasionally be played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourceMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourceMusic">over the camp P.A. system</a>).

He gets called out more in the later seasons (with even B.J. calling him depraved in "Taking The Fifth"), and heavily implied to be trauma-related in "Who Knew", but still tries to prostitute himself for charity in "Give and Take" and teases everyone in the finale that he loved as many of them as he was able.</li><li> "Trapper" John is as bad as Hawkeye when it comes to chasing; unlike Pierce, Trapper is actually married back home.</li><li> Major Houlihan is this during the Comedic phase, as she tends to have had intimate relationships with the visiting officers; her promiscuity is her worst-kept secret (alongside her passionate love affair with Frank Burns) and is why she has her nickname. But she also tends to make use of these relationships to further various schemes hatched by she and/or Frank.

In the novel, his mother is dead but he has a brother.</li><li> Colonel Potter's hometown is Hannibal, MO, but for some reason, in one episode, it's changed to Nebraska, and in another it's Montana.</li><li> During B.J.'s earlier appearances, he mentions that his daughter, Erin, is two years old; however, in the finale, he's upset at the prospect of missing her second birthday. He also says he and his wife went out for the first time after Erin was born and returned home to find his orders to ship out to Korea had come through.</li><li> In "Last Laugh", B.J. claims that his friend Bardonaro played a practical joke his wedding and that they both gave up practical joking "ten years ago" (peresumably after they both graduated from med school and after B.J.'s wedding). 1953-10=1943; both B.J. and Bardonaro would have been drafted in World War II; yet Bardonaro wears only Korean War medals on his dress jacket. In "Welcome to Korea" B.J.'s age is given as 28, which means B.J. went to Medical School at 14 and graduated at 18.</li><li> Radar's virginity. It's established in the original novel and movie that he's lost his virginity, as an example of being corrupted by wartime impulses; when the series begins, Radar is a virgin (and the fact is even played with on occasion); in an early Season Three episode, it is heavily implied that he loses his virginity to a nurse of the week; afterwards, he's back to being a virgin, and seemingly stays that way.<ul><li> Radar is more than happy to smoke Colonel Blake's cigars and sneak his whiskey when he isn't around, but is introduced to them for apparently the first time by Colonel Potter.</li><li> In one early episode Colonel Blake discovers Radar has a tattoo while giving him a physical. A much later episode has a subplot about Radar contemplating getting a tattoo for the very first time.</li></ul></li><li> Within the same season, Frank mentions having taken two judo lessons, then, just a few episodes later, Frank confuses judo for a religion.</li><li> The 4077 staff's ability to speak Korean. At times Radar can speak it conversationally, other times it's like he's unaware Korean is even a language. Hawkeye is seen practicing Korean a couple of times, but doesn't seem to have picked it up. Father Mulcahy speaks a few words, but Margaret is the only one that is particularly fluent. And even <em>that</em> wasn't entirely consistent: in the episode where the 4077th adopts a seemingly orphaned boy, Margaret tries to read him a bedtime story, but is constantly checking with an English-to-Korean dictionary throughout the story in an attempt to translate for him.</li><li> The year the show is supposed to take place changes repeatedly, from 1950 in the pilot to (reasonably) 1953 by "Rainbow Bridge" in season three (based on a real incident), then Potter's arrival in September 1952 and a passing reference several episodes later to General Eisenhower's visit to Korea in 1952 in "The Late Captain Pierce", then New Year's Day 1951 and 1952 in "A War for All Seasons" (which did the most damage) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13t3tk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13t3tk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13t3tk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The episode begins New Year's Day 1951 and included Col.

Did Potter step back in time?</span>, an episode covering China's entrance to the war in October 1950 with MacArthur's statement of "This is an entirely new war" announced on the PA, and a near constant reference to General MacArthur being in command throughout the show's run (MacArthur was relieved of command in spring 1951 for insubordination).</li><li> Before Radar's discharge, Klinger was a reasonably competent substitute clerk. One episode after Radar leaves, Klinger has trouble doing even the most basic duties until he gets help from Potter and Mulcahy.</li><li> In "Comrades in Arms Part 2", while demonstrating a new vascular surgery at the 8063, Margaret mentions the clamp they use was invented at the 4077, yet three episodes later in "Patient 4077", they actually make the clamp.

He mentions he lied about his age to join in "Change of Command", and in "Foreign Affairs" he mentions he fell in love with a French woman named Danielle twenty years his senior. But, in "Pressure Points", he says he's 62, which would put his date of birth in 1889 or 1890, making him at least 27 by the time the US entered the war. He also mentions he was inspired to join the cavalry by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s Rough Riders and San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War, so while it could be possible he joined before the war, he also states he joined in 1917.</li><li> At the end of "Smilin' Jack", the PA announcer makes a reference to the battle of Solma-Ri, also known as "Gloucesters Hill" or the battle of the Imjin River, in which 1st Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment held off overwhelming Chinese forces for four days, from 22 to 25 April 1951. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note148f57');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note148f57" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note148f57');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although completely surrounded, hugely outnumbered and short of ammunition, the Gloucesters continued to fight, delaying the Chinese advance long enough for other UN forces to establish a new defensive line where the Chinese advance was finally halted. When finally ordered to retreat, only 46 Gloucesters out of an initial strength of around 700 men managed to reach UN lines, with the rest either dead, missing or captured. Following the battle, the "Glorious Gloucesters" (as they became known) were awarded the US Distinguished Unit Citation for "exceptionally outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism in action", while the British decorations included two Victoria Crosses.</span> However, two episodes later in "Deluge", China has intervened in the war, entering Korea with 30 divisions, totalling 300,000 troops, which occured on 3 November 1950, and a reference is made to General MacArthur's statement of "we now face an entirely new war", which he made to the Joints Chiefs of Staff on 28 November 1950.</li><li> In "Mail Call", Hawkeye says this is his second war. But then mentions that he was drafted. If he had served in WW II he would have had a 4A classification for prior service, making him exempt.</li><li> In "The Novocaine Mutiny", Frank Burns is stated to have been drafted as a doctor, but other episodes state he was a reservist who was activated when the war broke out.</li><li> Mulcahy's piano playing skills, or lack thereof, seem to change all the time. On some occasions, he can actually play the piano quite well, especially when it comes to ragtimes or waltzes, but most of the time, his playing leaves a lot to be desired, either rendering the tune unrecognizable, or having trouble finding where the music ends.</li><li> In the Season 6 episode "Potter's Retirement", Charles mentions that the first successful open-heart surgery has just been performed.

It's at least a half a minute long, during which Col. Potter, B.J. and Charles are standing on looking uncomfortable and trying to find something else to look at. The season 6 two-parter "Comrades in Arms" has them making out while spending the night in an abandoned hut behind enemy lines. In the morning it's clear that Margaret takes things a lot more seriously than Hawkeye does, leading to a serious falling-out between them before they finally decide they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a>.</li><li> Some early episodes show Margaret also having a barely-suppressed attraction to Trapper John.

Every time a character left the series, a new character was brought in to fulfill the same in-unverse role, but generally came with a very different personality and character history than the character being replaced:<ul><li> The incompetent commander-in-name-only draftee Henry Blake was replaced by the <em>very</em> competent (and respected by all) career-Army man Sherman T. Potter.</li><li> The womanizing Trapper John, who was often seen casually cheating on his wife, was replaced by the stringently faithful B.J.

Klinger, who did nearly everything he could to get out of the Army by any means necessary.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySmallArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySmallArmy">Suspiciously Small Army</a>: A real MASH unit usually had around 200 personnel, at least 10 medical officers, 12 nurses, 89 enlisted soldiers of assorted medical and non-medical specialties, one Medical Service Corps officer, one Warrant Officer and other commissioned officers of assorted specialties, such as an anesthesiologist, and a dentist. The 4077 had, at most, 70 personnel, an administrative staff of just the CO and his clerk, and four doctors (five in season one, but Spearchucker Jones was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">written out without explanation</a>), Ugly John (the anesthesiologist) shows up in the first few episodes on season one, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">also written out without an explanation</a>, and Dr. Kaplan (the dentist) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> in the first season finale.

One half-joke is that they're not paid to put people to sleep, they're paid to make sure they wake up. This is why it is not a job just anybody can do. Of course, it wouldn't be impossible for the situation to make them short-handed enough that a nurse with enough experience would be "drafted" to fill the role, but it would never be done as a regular thing the way it is portrayed</span><ul><li> While occasional references are made to other doctors being present ("All surgical personnel report to the O.R.! Both shifts!") we never see any of them.</li><li> All of which makes the season three episode "Rainbow Bridge" and the season 4 episode "The Bus" especially problematic, as the former depicts three of the 4077's surgeons (Hawkeye, Trapper and Frank) leaving to rescue wounded UN forces taken prisoner, while the latter has all four of the 4077th's regular surgeons (Hawkeye, B.J., Frank, Col. Potter) spending an extended period away from camp for a medical convention. Who was operating on the wounded in their absence? For that matter, both episodes feature Radar, even though it's repeatedly demonstrated the camp literally can not function without him.</li><li> The proper total number of people in this type of unit was known to the show's creators, at least for a time. In "Dear Ma", Radar mentions the unit has about 200 people in it when he's helping Hawkeye with the regular foot inspection (and then gets the math wrong and says that 200 people times 10 toes each makes 20 000 toes to check).</li><li> On rare occasions, other doctors are addressed just offscreen or shown in the background (one episode has Hawkeye ask for "Don" to help him with an operation, and in that same shot a never-before-seen man with glasses is seen helping Trapper; in the episode where Frank ends up at Battalion Aid with a toe tag, wounded come in and are treated without any of the main cast being woken up for it), but other times they are simply referenced as though they are in camp but offscreen for some unknown reason.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-Y&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>: In universe example - when Frank Burns is not returning following his nervous breakdown after Margaret's marriage, the happiness and euphoria that is felt over him not returning is soured when it's revealed that the charges against him were dropped, he's being shipped home and promoted to Lt. Colonel to top it all off, much to the anger of Hawkeye and B.J.. In a weird sense, it really does feel like Frank's parting shot at Hawkeye and the camp as a whole.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: Margaret's foot locker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She's trying to replace it in one episode, and she can only do so if it's been damaged in combat.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a>: Happens in multiple episodes.

The tank begins drawing enemy mortar fire, so Klinger erects a tent to hide it. It doesn't work, and the mortar crew resumes firing on the camp, and Hawkeye drives it out of the camp.

Yet, the trained observer will see that what these two officers have in mind is to arrange a bit of brass rubbing."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma">Wire Dilemma</a>: "The Army-Navy Game"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsSmallestViolin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsSmallestViolin">World's Smallest Violin</a>: Possibly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a>: Margaret does this in 1978 when Charles complains that an overflow of post-op patients has kicked him out of his tent.<div class="indent"><strong>Margaret</strong>: Charles, do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, and it's playing just for you.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Winchester, for Hawkeye and B.J.. In fact, he was designed this way, in contrast to the man he replaced, Frank, who was little more than a punching bag for Hawkeye and B.J. and Trapper before him. Charles stood as an equal or even a superior to his colleagues in surgery, and could give as good as he got in insults and pranks.<ul><li> Occasionally moved into the realm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>, whenever Hawkeye or B.J. would have an actual problem and Winchester's empathy would kick in, and likewise Hawkeye and B.J. both admitted a respect and care for Charles they never displayed for his predecessor Frank.</li><li> If Winchester hadn't had total disdain for pretty much everyone in camp, he'd probably have been very close friends with the other two. The boys probably respected him more because he was capable of taking their pranks and pranking them back, and his surgical skills were impressive (which is more than could be said for Frank's, especially post-Flanderization).</li><li> Then there were those times when one of them (usually B.J.) would form a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">temporary alliance</a> with Charles, either against the remaining Swampmate (usually Hawkeye) or some other character.</li></ul></li><li> Margaret actually has hints of this with Hawkeye. They might have clashed over matters of discipline and regulation (especially early on in the series) but it's quite clear that both of them never had anything but the highest respect for each other's skills and professional ability. If Margaret hadn't been so uptight (or if Hawkeye hadn't been so nuts) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> probably would have become more than just teasing.</li><li> One time, Frank managed to continually one-up Hawkeye with pranks (trick showerheads, a bucket of water over the door, etc). In the end, Hawkeye wins the prank war by rolling up the wall of the latrine tent while Frank is occupied therein, finishing with a genuine looking salute.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: Became increasingly pronounced in the later seasons of the show, particularly in the episodes that Alan Alda scripted (where this approached <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> status).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongInsultOffense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongInsultOffense">Wrong Insult Offense</a>: Hawkeye, B.J., and Charles were all called a crumb, a louse, and a schmo in that order by Major Houlihan. When Houlihan later calls all of them crumbs together, Hawkeye corrects her by saying B.J. is a schmo and Charles is a louse, while <em>he</em> is the only crumb. B.J. and Winchester then correct him that <em>B.J.</em> is the louse and <em>Charles</em> is the schmo.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook">Wrote the Book</a>: Hawkeye wrote the book on the appendix. (He even wrote the appendix, but <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">they</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">took that out</a>.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Yank the Dog's Chain</a>:<ul><li> The first season has an episode where everyone comes to believe that there's been a ceasefire and the war is over. During their "farewell" party they learn the sad news: the war isn't over, and the wounded are arriving.</li><li> Another early episode has Trapper thinking he'll get to go home due to a stomach ulcer, and even getting a farewell party, before being told by HQ that he'll have to stay in Korea and be operated on there.</li><li> Trapper gets put through the wringer again in "Kim", deciding to adopt a seemingly-orphaned Korean boy with his wife back in the States, then having to rescue the kid after he wanders into a minefield...<em>then</em> having to watch as the kid's mother turns up and whisks him away.</li><li> Season three's finale has Henry Blake getting discharged and finally getting to go home. What happened next was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">trope-naming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">moment</a>.<span style="display:none">invoked</span></li><li> In "Welcome to Korea", Hawkeye races to an airport to try and say goodbye to Trapper, who was discharged while Hawkeye was away on leave and couldn't stay any longer. Naturally, despite his best efforts, Hawkeye misses him by minutes.</li><li> In a more humorous example, Klinger comes tantalizingly close to actually getting a Section 8 discharge in "None Like It Hot". He dons a fur coat and other warm-weather gear in the middle of a blistering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeatWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeatWave">Heat Wave</a>, and Col. Potter is so impressed with his determination that he promises to approve a Section 8 if he can keep it up for 24 hours. When Klinger finally breaks down and gives up toward the end of the episode, a sincerely disappointed Potter notes that he only had an hour left to go.</li><li> In the show's final episode, B.J. receives discharge papers, though they are quickly rescinded. Col. Potter is informed of this, but doesn't say anything - hoping B.J. will be stateside before anyone finds out. Unfortunately, he only makes it as far as Guam before he's yanked back to the 4077th. (However, he does ultimately get to go home - along with everybody else - when the war ends shortly thereafter.)<div class="indent"> <strong>B.J.:</strong> I'm sitting there in this crummy officers club, and this guy comes up to me, and says, "You Hunnicutt the doctor?" Now, I didn't like the sound of that, so I said, "No, not me, pal, I'm Hunnicutt the chaplain." He says, "Well, chaplain, you'd better start praying for a miracle, because you're going back to Korea to do surgery."</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>:<ul><li> Played with in "Chief Surgeon Who?" Hawkeye plays up his promotion to chief surgeon, when General Barker (whom Frank and Margaret called) comes to see Pierce in action. In the operating room with a patient:<div class="indent"><strong>Hawkeye:</strong> Y'see, dad, we've seen only large holes, no small ones. I think he took one in his lingular and we won't find it unless we go in and get it. I've seen some bubbles I can't account for. (<em>To nurse</em>) Suction. please. (<em>feels around in patient; then reaction</em>) And there it is. <br><strong>Gen. Barker:</strong> I'm impressed! <br><strong>Hawkeye:</strong> (<em>sheepishly</em>) So am I.</div></li><li> One of the more heartwarming examples of this trope comes in the Season 8 episode "Morale Victory". Winchester manages to save the leg of a soldier, only to find out the patient is more worried about the fact his hand is permanently damaged, as he's a concert pianist. Winchester is so devastated by this, and by the man's desire to give up, that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">actually goes to Father Mulcahy for advice</a>, and Mulcahy tells Winchester his love of classical music is the way to reach the man. Winchester ends up ordering some sheet music for piano players with one hand, gives them to the reluctant patient, and gives him this speech:<div class="indent"><strong>Winchester:</strong> Don't you see? Your hand may be stilled, but your gift cannot be silenced if you refuse to let it be. The gift does not lie in your hands. I have hands, David. Hands that can make a scalpel sing. More than anything in my life I wanted to play, but I do not have the gift. I can play the notes, but I cannot make the music. You have performed Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Chopin. Even if you never do so again, you've already known a joy that I will never know as long as I live. Because the true gift is in your head and in your heart and in your soul. Now you can shut it off forever, or you can find new ways to share your gift with the world - through the baton, the classroom, or the pen. As to these works, they're for you, because you and the piano will always be as one.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">You Are in Command Now</a>:<ul><li> "Carry On, Hawkeye" was a funny example; "Commander Pierce" much less so.</li><li> The one time that Winchester was left in command, he simply allowed everyone to go about their routine and instead focused on pampering himself (having Klinger acquire silk sheets, fine food, etc).</li><li> Anytime Blake or Potter said this to Burns, the unit prepared for a journey across the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious">You Called Me "X"; It Must Be Serious</a>:<ul><li> Despite their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">disdain for military protocol</a>, Hawkeye and B.J. on regularly address Col. Potter by his rank out of respect for his competent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">compassionate</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">thoughtful</a> approach to command. Only once, when Potter has been badly upset by another soldier snitching on him to his superiors and is contemplating leaving the Army, does Hawkeye call him "Sherm," urging him to stay.</li><li> Winchester only ever refers to Hawkeye as "Pierce" except for when they are waiting by the phone to hear word about Hawkeye's father (who is having a surgery done). He calls him "Hawkeye" while telling him that he envies the relationship Pierce and his father have. It's the only time that Winchester drops his walls around his fellow surgeons. Similarly, when Klinger and Winchester call each other Max and Charles at Christmas when Klinger lets on that he knows about Winchester secretly donating sweets to the orphans.</li><li> Invoked in the finale: Col. Potter calls Father Mulcahy "Francis" for the first time as they say goodbye. Made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">heartbreaking</a> by the fact that the Father couldn't hear him due to his deafness.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanSayThatAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanSayThatAgain">You Can Say That Again</a>: In "A Smattering of Intelligence," when Pratt and Flagg show up to arrest Frank:<div class="indent"><strong>Flagg:</strong> He's a communist. <br><strong>Pratt:</strong> He's a fascist! <br><strong>Frank:</strong> I am not!
