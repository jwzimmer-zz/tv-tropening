The 1973 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">pilot</a>, <em>Shopper's Bazaar</em>, was very different from the series; a further two pilots in 1974 hosted by Edd "Kookie" Byrnes (who admitted that he was drunk) held far closer to the rules we know today.</p><p>When <em>Wheel</em> debuted in 1975, Chuck Woolery was the host and Susan Stafford <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">operated the puzzle board</a>. By late 1983, after Woolery left the show in a salary dispute with Merv Griffin and Stafford left to do humanitarian work, Pat Sajak and Vanna White had become the show's full-time hosts in both daytime and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Syndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Syndication">syndication</a>, although there was a ten-month period from 1981-82 in which Pat and Susan worked together. (White became popular out of proportion to the popularity of any other woman in a similar role on a game show.) The syndicated <em>Wheel</em> dropped the shopping element in 1987, then switched from a mechanical puzzle board to one with touch screens a decade later. Starting in the early 1990s, it has added (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredGameShowElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredGameShowElement">and occasionally retired</a>) all manner of new wrinkles, including new puzzle categories and a trio of Toss-Up puzzles.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>After Sajak left the daytime <em>Wheel</em> to try his luck as a late-night talk show host on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a>, former football player Rolf Benirschke (who had very little previous TV experience) and Bob Goen tried unsuccessfully to take his place. Under Goen's watch, <em>Wheel</em> jumped to CBS for 18 months before returning to NBC for another nine (and eventually folding). In 1997, CBS and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN">GSN</a> tried a children's spin-off titled <em>Wheel 2000</em>, which did not fare well and remains the last daytime version. The nighttime version has carried on for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">an impressively long time</a>, and is still one of the highest-rated TV series in syndication.</p><p>The show has had multiple international adaptations, notably the Australian version which ran from 1981 to 2006.

Inverted with the 2007 pinball game and the mobile game <em>Wheel of Fortune Free Play</em>, which features the voice of Pat but not Vanna (who still appears on the cabinet and game art, respectively).</li><li> Occurred for three weeks of episodes in Season 37 due to Sajak's surgery; Vanna hosted in his place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>: The "Same Letter" category, in which every word in the puzzle begins with the same letter. Since 2014, contestants receive a $1,000 bonus for calling the "Same Letter" in question. For reasons unknown, the category took a brief hiatus when the show filmed six weeks of episodes in Las Vegas in 2013, but that didn't stop them from using several puzzles that would normally fit the category, such as the infamous CORNER CURIO CABINET puzzle, which was categorized as "Thing".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothing">All or Nothing</a>: Played with.<ul><li> The show itself averts it, as contestants are guaranteed at least the house minimum<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xon9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0xon9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xon9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or before Season 23, parting gifts for a player who finishes a game with $0</span>by the end of the game; however, the Mystery Wedges in Round 2 and the Express Wedge in Round 3 play the trope straight during their respective rounds.</li><li> For the Mystery Wedges, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">uncovering one</a> means the contestant either wins a $10,000 cash prize or loses everything to a Bankrupt. During the wedges' first round of existence, the announcer would even say "The Mystery Round: It's all or nothing."</li><li> For the Express Wedge, the contestant can either choose to continue their turn as normal or play a solo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRound">Speed Round</a>, with each correct consonant earning $1,000 while vowels still deduct $250. Express play ends either by solving the puzzle correctly or making a wrong guess, with the latter acting the same as landing on Bankrupt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlohaHawaii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlohaHawaii">Aloha, Hawaii!</a>: Often invoked with the many trips to Hawaii the show has awarded, but they have also taped outdoors in front of the Waikoloa Village on four separate occasions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a>: Compared to sister show <em>Jeopardy!</em>, <em>Wheel</em> is often treated this way, with the latter show often being viewed as inferior due to its different type of gameplay.<ul><li> Through 1986, both syndicated shows had 195 episodes per season. Since then, <em>Jeopardy!</em> now has 230 episodes per season while <em>Wheel</em> has stayed at 195. As a result, the latter has 13 weeks of reruns between seasons while the former only has 6.</li><li> Various "Greatest Game Shows of All Time" lists almost-always place <em>Wheel</em> a small number of spots below <em>Jeopardy!</em></li><li> The Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show has been won by <em>Jeopardy!</em> several times. The one time <em>Wheel</em> won it was in a tie with its sister show, likely to tie into both Pat Sajak and Alex Trebek receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award that year. In recent years, <em>Wheel</em> is not even nominated for the award at all.</li><li> When stations have to reschedule at least one of the two game shows due to a pre-emption, <em>Jeopardy!</em> is usually given priority because of its continuity by having returning champions, (something <em>Wheel</em> abandoned several years ago) or because of slightly higher ratings in recent years. If <em>Jeopardy!'s</em> time slot is scheduled to be pre-empted, some stations will actually move it to air in <em>Wheel's</em> unaffected time slot, with the latter airing late at night or not at all.</li><li> When <em>Jeopardy!</em> champion James Holzhauer became a media sensation for his several record-breaking scores, the show's ratings reached new highs not seen since Ken Jennings' run. This caused many affiliates to heavily promote the show, while <em>Wheel</em> received little to no promotion despite being its sister program. Partially as a result, <em>Wheel's</em> ratings saw no significant increase during Holzhauer's run.</li><li> If an online poll asks "<em>Wheel of Fortune</em> or <em>Jeopardy!</em>?", expect the latter to win by a landslide, along with comments such as, "How could anyone like <em>Wheel</em> better than <em>Jeopardy!</em>?"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring">And Starring</a>: Until the daytime show moved back to NBC on January 14, 1991, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer">The Announcer</a> introduced only Chuck/Pat/Rolf/Bob, who in turn would introduce Susan/[guest hostess]/Vanna. The nighttime show changed the opening spiel to introduce Pat and Vanna together on September 4, 1989.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedCreditsOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedCreditsOpening">Animated Credits Opening</a>: The show has used these on and off since 1992:<ul><li> Seasons 10-11: Anthropomorphic Wheel wedges walking down a staircase.</li><li> Season 12: Hand-drawn versions of Pat and Vanna "riding" the Wheel amid graphics related to the show; this animation ended with them parachuting.</li><li> Seasons 14-17: CGI of the Sony Pictures Studio, with the camera "zooming in" through the studio doors.</li><li> Season 23: One of three intros showing people racing to their TV sets to watch the show: one shows a man ostensibly getting ready for a date, one shows a woman racing home from work, and one shows a suburban African-American family finishing dinner quickly then running to the couch. The last one has also been used for "America's Game" weeks in Seasons 31 and 32.</li><li> Season 28: Each intro is tied in to the week's theme, using the Pat and Vanna avatars from the 2010 THQ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> game. Some of these showed up again in later seasons, most often as bumpers but occasionally as openings, most notably the one for Halloween week, which has been re-used most years since.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer">The Announcer</a>:<ul><li> Mike Lawrence did the first pilot and Charlie O'Donnell the other two. For the show proper, Charlie O'Donnell (1975-80), Jack Clark (1980-88), M. G. Kelly (1988-89), O'Donnell again (1989-2010), and Jim Thornton (2011-). Don Morrow filled in for one week in 1980, O'Donnell returned a few times in the 1980s when Clark was unavailable; and Johnny Gilbert filled in for both Clark and O'Donnell at various points. Don Pardo did the two weeks of 1988 nighttime episodes taped at Radio City Music Hall. Gilbert, John Cramer, Joe Cipriano, Rich Fields, Lora Cain, and Thornton all filled in after Charlie's death.</li><li> John Deeks was the most prominent announcer of the Australian version.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a>:<ul><li> 1991: Vanna appeared to be pregnant in the final segment...until she pulled a cushion out from her dress.</li><li> 1996: APRIL FOOL'S DAY was the Round 1 puzzle.</li><li> 1997: Pat hosted that day's <em>Jeopardy!</em> while Alex hosted <em>Wheel</em>. Pat and Vanna also played <em>Wheel</em> that day with Pat's wife, Lesly, at the puzzle board. The entire flip-flop was lampshaded heavily by the puzzles, especially the Speed-Up and Bonus Round puzzles (IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS and TRADING PLACES, respectively).</li><li> 2008: Pat "revealed" that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYvYtft5EmQ">he was actually bald.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Vanna's reaction was priceless. The moment is often replayed or mentioned on subsequent April 1 episodes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was a real wig on a bald wig.</span></li><li> 2010: The show did ten things that were "out of the ordinary" and asked home viewers to spot them. All ten were revealed on the next show. Examples included the full-size Bankrupt wedges saying "Bankrut" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13jkw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13jkw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13jkw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Gratuitous Polish)</span>, Charlie taking Vanna's place for a couple shots, Pat wearing a barely-visible stud earring for a whole round, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">footage of a Final Spin from a 1995 episode over the current one</a>, etc. There were also two seconds of rodeo footage in the opening montage of tropical shots, although this was never pointed out.</li><li> 2011: All the puzzles (except the bonus round) had some form of the word "fool". Amazingly, the contestants never caught on.</li><li> 2016: Jim reads a promo for "Live like a Pilgrim Week" after the first round. This episode re-aired in 2017 due to April 1 falling on a Saturday that year.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">nearly all cases</a>, the older music beds (prize cues, Toss-Up bed, puzzle-solve cue, theme song) were dubbed over with their modern counterparts. This led to particularly jarring dubs, such as the current Toss-Up solve cue on a clip obviously from the late 1980s. The pre-1983 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune">Theme Tune</a> "Big Wheels" remained untouched, as did all but one instance of the 1994-97 solve cue. (They showed a clip from 1994 twice: the first airing had the original cue, but the second airing had the current cue dubbed in.)<ul><li> Perhaps the most egregious was a 1985-86 clip of Jack Clark describing a prize, in which they scrubbed out nearly <em>all</em> of the music around Jack's voice (which, for the record, was Merv's "Frisco Disco").</li><li> They also showed retro clips in Season 25, but in those cases the music was always left intact.</li><li> All of the classic themes were left intact during "Wheel 6000" week in 2014, which featured different retrospectives on shows 1,000-4,000, each one being backed the appropriate theme of the era.</li><li> The show's music cues were changed in January 2017, halfway through Season 34. However, the week of episodes airing April 3-7, 2017 was taped before this change, so the new cues had to be spliced in during post-production. This resulted in several sloppy sound edits, and even a couple cases where the old cues were left completely untouched. Reruns of Season 33 and early Season 34 episodes, were likewise changed after this point, with the original music often being highly audible underneath the new music.</li><li> In November 2018, Game Show Network aired a special showcasing several memorable moments over the years. Almost every past music cue was dubbed over with its 2000's equivalent. While there were a few exceptions, they were very inconsistent, such as footage from a 1989 episode leaving the original solve cue intact for one puzzle, then overdubbing it on another puzzle from the same episode.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">Colour-Coded for Your Convenience</a>: Like so many other game shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">before and after</a> it, <em>Wheel</em> separates the contestants into red, yellow, and blue motifs. Chuck Woolery would sometimes refer to Player 2 as "Mellow Yellow". For a time in 1975, the displays themselves also used these colors before going to white (which had also been used in the 1974 pilots). From 1981-97, colored backdrops appeared behind the contestants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">Complacent Gaming Syndrome</a>:<span style="display:none">invoked</span> Frequently invoked by contestants:<ul><li> In the earliest days, any money left over after shopping (less than the least-expensive prize remaining) was immediately put "on account", meaning that it carried over to the next shopping round and would be lost if the contestant hit Bankrupt or failed to solve another puzzle (which gave the contestant the ability to buy the prizes). By mid-July 1975, contestants could put leftover money on a gift certificate while retaining the "on account" option. Until the shopping aspect was ousted entirely in mid-1989, almost <em>all</em> contestants asked for the gift certificate. That said, one recollection had at least one contestant place all of his money "on account" for the first two rounds (i.e., deciding not to go shopping)... and after winning the game, he used his winnings to buy one of the new cars onstage, with plenty left over for some of the other prizes); said episode was believed to air either in 1978 or '79.</li><li> When the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> was introduced in December 1981, contestants were asked for five consonants and a vowel to help fill in a blank puzzle; they almost exclusively picked some permutation of R, S, T, L, N and E because those letters are so common. The rules changed on October 3, 1988 to give them those letters automatically and ask for three more consonants and a vowel, and the time limit was cut from 15 seconds to 10. This trope showed up again even under the new rules, as countless contestants guess the next-most common letters C, D, M and A. This itself has occasionally been replaced with B/P, H, G, and O, which a couple different sources have unofficially found the most strategic.</li><li> In the shopping era, contestants could pick from any of the remaining prizes in the bonus round, but almost always chose cars. After shopping ended on nighttime in October 1987, contestants were given the choice of five prizes in the bonus round ($25,000 cash, a car, and three other prizes that rotated weekly), but almost everyone went with the cash. This was most likely a combination of the other prizes often being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">undesirable</a> and the cash being less of a tax liability. Beginning in September 1989, the bonus prize selection was changed to a random draw from five envelopes spelling out W-H-E-E-L. If a prize was won, it was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3mzkb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3mzkb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3mzkb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(except for the $25,000 in Seasons 16-18; for the first few weeks of Season 19, all five envelopes were in play all week)</span>. The envelopes were ousted in November 2001 for a 24-space bonus Wheel, in which the top amount is $100,000 (or $1,000,000 if the contestant who made it to the bonus round lands on and keeps the million-dollar wedge during the game).</li><li> Some categories in general fall into this trope.<ul><li> For its first season of use, Same Name spelled out the word AND, causing nearly every contestant to start the round with N, D, and A. This was circumvented in Season 7 by replacing the word with an ampersand. The category occasionally relapsed into spelling out AND since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, although this practice seemed to have stopped during Season 35.</li><li> Husband &amp; Wife also guarantees the word AND, and it has also relapsed into spelling out the word for reasons unknown. This is also true for Proper Names and many Characters puzzles.</li><li> Song/Artist and Title/Author lend themselves to this, guaranteeing either BY or _____'S in each puzzle.</li><li> Expect "Things" to kick off with the letter "S", although some crafty puzzle writers will try to subvert this with objects that don't have an "s" with pluralization.</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to the above, nearly every contestant calls N, G, and I first if the category is What Are You Doing?, due to the category using at least one -ING ending about 99% of the time.</li><li> If T_E is revealed as part of a puzzle, expect the next consonant called to be "H". Even in the Bonus Round, the contestant is likely to call "H" as one of their consonants in this situation, presumably to make sure the word is indeed "THE" (revealing letters has no additional benefit in the Bonus Round).</li><li> If the Bonus Round puzzle is under any category but Phrase and has a single blank at the beginning that is obviously "A", expect the contestant to call it for their vowel. The writers are completely aware of this; generally, when a bonus puzzle starts with the word "A", there are no A's elsewhere in the puzzle.</li><li> If the Wheel lands on Free Play, expect the contestant to call a vowel if any are left.</li><li> Double Play, used only in the 1995-96 season, was frequently used immediately after the contestant earned it, often resulting in a paltry amount for an infrequent consonant.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfettiDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfettiDrop">Confetti Drop</a>: $100,000 and $1,000,000 winners get showered with confetti and streamers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> multiple times by Pat, either by making verbal references to it, sweeping it up after a big win, or having the contestants sweep it up themselves.<ul><li> Subverted on the October 12, 2020 episode.

The set was made to look like a department store, and the intro featured the three contestants being introduced by browsing through the "store" while the announcer described their prizes, whilst simultaneously playing their first turns each. Among other things, there was a motorized carnival-style Wheel (with a mind of its own at times, as well as Free Vowel and <em>$0</em> spaces), a rotary telephone to dispense clues (if a contestant landed on the "Your Own Clue" wedge, and only basic things like Person, Place, or Thing), an ugly pull-card puzzle board, a way-too-easy first attempt at a Bonus Round, a way-too-hard to understand scoring system, a rule where the contestant that won a round started the next one, a set that Bolen called "old-fashioned", and instrumental versions of "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" and "Spinning Wheel" as the show's main theme and commercial outro cue respectively. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Merv himself would later state that "everything about it was WRONG".</a> Once thought to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> (only about four publicity shots ever turned up in specials and retrospectives, only one of which was in color), the pilot finally surfaced in 2012 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and quickly began circulating among collectors.</li><li> A better-received (although not by much) pair of pilots were taped in 1974, with Edd "Kookie" Byrnes as the host. A few differences were seen from these shows and the eventual premiere, including the host generally giving a clue rather than a category (e.g., "the name of something good to eat" for the puzzle SPAGHETTI, rather than the more generic categories that would be used by mid-July 1975), a consistent set of prizes to choose from throughout the episode (as opposed to going to a different platform of prizes in a subsequent round). Although there was still lots of criticism, Lin Bolen put her job on the line and NBC accepted, under the condition that Chuck Woolery was host.</li></ul></li><li> Daytime show:<ul><li> When the show debuted in 1975, the "special" wedges (Bankrupt, Lose A Turn, Free Spin, and Buy A Vowel) had white outlines on the lettering and white borders, and spaces on the Wheel went as low as $25.</li><li> There originally was no rule for solving the words to a puzzle in order. After one contestant got credit for transposing the first and third words of TWEEDLEDUM AND TWEEDLEDEE, this rule was added. The only time it doesn't apply these days is when a Crossword Round is in play.</li><li> Also during the first year, the Speed-Up round (the round so-designated by the "Final Spin") was timed at 60 seconds (or sometimes, 2 minutes), and the contestants could not call vowels. Although not known based on existing episodes that circulate, this led to the possibility of puzzles going unsolved if the time limit expired. In late Summer or early Fall 1975, the time limit was lifted and the "no vowels" rule was modified by allowing contestants to call vowels (at no charge) after 30 seconds. By early 1976, the Speed-Up round rules as we know it came into play.</li><li> In the earliest days, contestants played puzzles to the last consonant and rarely bought vowels. Lin Bolen, then NBC's vice president of daytime programming, insisted on this so contestants would have more money to shop with &#151; she thought that putting more emphasis on shopping would help the show appeal better to the female demographic. Once she was ousted in 1975-76 for poor programming performance and replaced by Earl Greenburg, contestants began playing puzzles at their own pace. Also during the earliest months, each contestant (prior to the show) selected which showcase they wanted to shop first if they won the first round, with the first-round winner's choice told after the round was completed.</li><li> Even the Bonus Round underwent changes prior to the permanent version being implemented in December 1981. While these prior versions had the same basic rules as the ones that would become most familiar to contestants, the player chose only four consonants (plus the vowel) and did not know the category until <em>after</em> the chosen letters were revealed (if any). The one major difference with the hour-long and Star Bonus versions, however, was that the puzzle the player faced had everything to do with the prize s/he chose to play for &#150; that is, if you picked the Cadillac Eldorado parked onstage, you could be assured of facing a very difficult puzzle (one with few of the common consonants in it), while if you played for just a living room set, the puzzle would be fairly easy to guess with the right pick of letters. The difficulty of the puzzles starting in 1981 would have nothing to do with the prize selected.</li><li> During the first few years after the Bonus Round became permanent, contestants often played for lower-tier bonus prizes such as children's room furniture, a washer-dryer, a video camera-and-VCR package and a bedroom set (all in 1982-era episodes); there was speculation that the producers wanted to have contestants win at least twice before playing for the more expensive trips, cars and other grand prizes (although even then, cars and such were available during the regular rounds). Once the syndicated version took off - where contestants played for cars about 75% of the time, with expensive jewelry a distant (surprising) second - contestants on the daytime show began playing for the larger-ticket prizes on their first day more often.</li></ul></li><li> Yet another mannerism that was phased out around 1985 (at least, in the US): contestants almost always used to call their letters out phonetically (for instance, "C as in Chuck"; this is still a common practice among foreign versions), but this supposedly annoyed Merv. The producers prefer that contestants say only the letter to help minimize confusion (except when absolutely necessary, for clarification), but variants on "Can I have a(n)..." or "Is there a(n)..." aren't rare.</li><li> After the daytime show moved to CBS, $50 and $75 were used again, and diamonds were added to these wedges on the next show. The minimum dollar value was increased back to $100 after just two months.</li><li> In its first two seasons of use, the Jackpot wedge was modified <strong>six times</strong>.<ul><li> To a lesser extent, the Surprise wedge and $10,000 prize wedge similarly went through redesigns shortly after they were introduced.</li></ul></li><li> The "Preview Puzzle" only lasted one season before getting replaced by Toss-Ups. For their entire first season of use, there were only two, both valued at $1,000; there was also no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitScreen">Split Screen</a> during said rounds, meaning that home viewers had no visual indication as to who had rung in. After that point, they gained a split screen, a third one was added, and the values were shifted to $1,000/$2,000/$3,000.</li><li> The $25,000 sign introduced during the Big Month Of Cash and used for the rest of that season had a different design than the one used for the rest of that sign's existence.</li><li> The cash prizes on the Bonus Wheel other than the $100,000 were all $25,000 for the first season it existed. In the next season, values from $30,000 to $50,000 in increments of $5,000 were introduced permanently (they were previously used for a Big Money week in the season of its introduction).</li><li> Countless cash wedges have temporarily used different fonts, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://wheeloffortunehistory.wikia.com/wiki/File:5Kwide1984.png">this $5,000 wedge with a wide font<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. This was much more common early in the show's run.<ul><li> Additionally, mistakes in placement of wedges seemed to be much more common early in the show's run.</li></ul></li><li> For much of the early seasons, it was not uncommon for the bonus puzzle to be the longest one of the day, or for it to take up all four rows (even if it could reasonably fit on just two). From about Season 6 onward, the puzzle lengths became more balanced.</li><li> On some Season 1 nighttime episodes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionalConsideration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionalConsideration">Promotional Consideration</a> plugs were pre-recorded by the company instead of being read by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer">The Announcer</a>.

The "S-" prefix remains to this day, despite the daytime show being long gone. Rerun versions of episodes have "RR" after the number (e.g. S-6768RR). Post-production revisions append "Rev" (plus "Rev2", etc. if necessary) to the number.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSparkles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSparkles">Everything's Better with Sparkles</a>: The top dollar amount in each round is always on a sparkly wedge (except for the now-retired $1,000 before 1995). The Million-Dollar Wedge is sparkly, as were most iterations of the Jackpot wedge before it went neon. When the show went HD in 2006, sparkly outlines were added to all letters and numbers on the Wheel. The Wild Card is sparkly as well, along with the former Surprise Wedge (the lettering on its second iteration and the background on its third) Free Spin, Double Play, and Star Bonus tokens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraTurn">Extra Turn</a>: The Free Spin, retired in Season 27 for Free Play which is somewhat similar in concept.

Especially true on October 11, 2013, where a contestant got $11,000 from finding <em>eleven</em> M's at the wedge's $1,000-per-letter face value, meaning that flipping it over actually had <em>less</em> of a potential reward than taking the per-letter amount (since the per-letter amount is forfeited if you choose to flip it).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ihco');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5ihco" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ihco');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It turned out that the Bankrupt was on the other side, anyway.

In nighttime from 1983-89, contestants were one-and-done, and from 1989-96 nighttime had a three-day champion rule. This was changed in 1996 to "Friday Finals", where the three highest winners from Monday-Thursday competed against each other on Fridays, and whoever won on Friday received an extra prize. Nighttime returned to one-and-done in 1998. Although the show has claimed that the enormous amount of contestant applications saw the need to remove any sort of returning-championship format, Pat said on the Sony Rewards website that the show doesn't have returning champions because the most skilled players are not always the big winners &#151; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">a good puzzle solver could end up hitting an endless string of Bankrupts, while a lousy puzzle-solver could stumble his/her way into a runaway lead.</a></li><li> Nighttime also had a $200,000 cap on winnings prior to the adoption of the Million-Dollar Wedge, which would've not only required a $100,000 win in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> but <em>also</em> a six-digit win in the main game.

He also playfully chastised a contestant on a 1983 show after solving the puzzle HELL-BENT FOR ELECTION.</li><li> October 1989 (nighttime): The puzzle board reads _AR_EC_E S_IT. The contestant calls an "H".</li><li> December 1994: One of the puzzles is THE NAVY'S <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailhook_scandal">TAILHOOK SCANDAL<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> The 1994-95 season had one of the infamous "Megaword" puzzles solved as "EROTICISM"; to which afterwards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Pat</a> quipped that "If you can use that Megaword in a sentence <strong>suitable for the family hour</strong>, we'll throw in an additional $500." Pat then hints that this seemed to be a running theme that particular week, mentioning a previous puzzle pertaining to sex magazines and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">corns and warts</a>.</li><li> One of the most infamous bloopers in the show's history is a November 1999 episode where a contestant thought that "A GROUP OF PILL-PUSHERS" was the answer to the puzzle.</li><li> Although the show is rated TV-G, Pat has gotten away with a few "damn"s and "hell"s.</li><li> In one oft-cited moment, a contestant mis-solves the puzzle FRANKLY MY DEAR I DON'T GIVE A DAMN by replacing the last word with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDarnItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDarnItToHeck">DARN</a>.</li><li> January 7, 2011: First, after a Before &amp; After puzzle of VICTORIA'S SECRET RECIPE, Pat remarked that it involved "two cups of sugar" (a joke he had previously done when the same puzzle was used in 1996). Then, a contestant who lost the bonus round told Pat to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong">show me something small</a>" (in reference to the prize money), but Pat played up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">Accidental Innuendo</a><span style="display:none">invoked</span> and began walking off the set.

While this was never confirmed to be intentional, the contestant couldn't help but smirk...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the only letter he lit up was one I and failed to solve HOMETOWN FAVORITE.</span></li><li> June 6, 2012: Round 1 is I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING (Movie Quote), which comes from a rather family-<em>un</em>friendly scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhenHarryMetSally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhenHarryMetSally">When Harry Met Sally...</a></em>.

Two contestants have exclaimed the word "crap" after solving the Prize Puzzle, and in both cases, it was censored. The first instance was simply muted out, but the second was censored with the "wrong letter" buzzer (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep">Sound-Effect Bleep</a> below).</li><li> February 11, 2016: One contestant, after realizing she rang in too early on a Toss-Up, exclaimed an obscenity. Although it was mostly removed from the audio, it could still faintly be heard, plus it was made more obvious by the contestant's lips, Pat turning his head in shock, and the contestant apologizing while she and Pat stifled laughter.</li><li> March 14, 2018: A contestant guesses "RIDING BAREBACK" for RIDING PIGGYBACK. Given that she also guessed "RIDING HORSEBACK", Pat played it off as if she meant "BEARBACK", though "BAREBACK" was displayed on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClosedCaptioning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClosedCaptioning">Closed Captioning</a>.</li><li> October 4, 2018: A contestant was faced with a Same Name of BRIDAL &amp; COLD SHOWER, from which only the C was missing.

"BRIDAL &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">GOLD SHOWER</a>."</li><li> One for <em>Wheel 2000</em>: one of its several physical games involved dressing up with four letter-bearing articles of clothing to spell out valid four-letter words as quickly as possible. Thankfully, no contestant was known to have tried to spell something dirty, but it was possible to do so with the letters available.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">Golden Snitch</a>:<ul><li> Sometimes invoked if Pat hits $5,000 in the Final Spin. With a $1,000 bonus in later years, that's $6,000 per consonant in a game that usually averages $10,000-$20,000 for the winner. Also invoked if the Prize Puzzle prize is particularly expensive (they start at $7,000, but can be upwards of $12,000, especially during team weeks). In one particularly egregious example, a contestant went into Round 4 with $27,600 but still ended up losing because an opponent benefited greatly from a $6,000 Final Spin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">On the other hand</a>, another contestant who had only $5,000 from the second and third Toss-Ups got $30,000 in a $6,000-per-letter Speed-Up, but still lost to someone who had $37,400.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">In one episode</a>, a contestant whose only two spins had both landed on Bankrupt, and whose only winnings were from the $3,000 Toss-Up, managed to pull a come-from-behind win with a low Final Spin value of $1,550.</li><li> Another weird variation came in a Spring 1984 episode, where a female contestant who had no money to that point hit $5,000 in Round 3, called a single letter, and solved. It was the last puzzle. Her opponents had $4,925 and $0, so she went from $0 to winner in literally the span of a single spin!</li><li> Yet another weird zig-zagging came on a 1996 episode where a contestant managed to go from $0 to victory in Round 4 without ever hitting $5,000.</li><li> The Prize Puzzle is usually a guaranteed victory, since the prize is a minimum of $7,000 <em>on top of</em> the normal winnings from the round. Winning it off of a successful Express run renders the entire rest of the game pointless; even <em>$6,000 Final Spins</em> have failed to catch players who swept up a windfall from that scenario.</li><li> Winning both halves of the &frac12; Car, when it existed, would usually do the same by adding a roughly-$15,000 car to the winner's total.</li><li> Also a good way to earn a lot of money in a hurry: Wild Card + multiple letters on $2,500 or $3,500.</li><li> The Jackpot, when it existed, often got north of $10,000. Most of the time, a contestant would already have some money banked before claiming the Jackpot, so winning it often meant a pretty big total in that round.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>: When the show announced it was adding a $1,000,000 prize in 2008, many game show fans scoffed at the complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> required to win it.

In 1979, Susan dislocated her shoulder in a car accident, so Summer and Cynthia Washington (ex-wife of San Francisco 49ers' Gene Washington) filled in for her for just over two weeks.</li><li> Summer, Vicki McCarty, and Vanna filled in between Susan's departure and Vanna's first official episode. Susan returned for a daytime Teen Week in June 1986 so Vanna could recover from the death of her then-boyfriend.</li><li> Tricia Gist, then-girlfriend and now-wife of Merv Griffin's son Tony, filled in for two weeks in January 1991 to accommodate for Vanna's wedding, and again two months later due to Vanna having a bad cold.</li><li> Charlie O'Donnell filled in for Jack Clark for a few weeks in 1985 due to Jack having schedule conflicts (which ultimately led to Jack leaving <em>The $25,000 Pyramid</em>). Charlie returned from May-June 1988 due to Jack being stricken with bone cancer, which ended his life on July 21. Until about September, Charlie and Johnny Gilbert took turns filling in on daytime before M.G. Kelly was hired. And of course, when M.G. was let go in February 1989, Charlie came back.</li><li> Don Pardo, whose most recent game show work at that point was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackpot">Jackpot</a></em> in 1975, served as announcer when the show went to Radio City Music Hall in November 1988.</li><li> Johnny Gilbert also announced two weeks of shows in 1995.</li><li> And after Charlie's death, several guest announcers <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6cxu4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6cxu4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6cxu4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Lora Cain, Joe Cipriano, John Cramer, Rich Fields, Johnny Gilbert, and Jim Thornton)</span> rotated until Jim Thornton was chosen as the permanent replacement.</li><li> A rare example of a guest <em>director</em>. Longtime director Mark Corwin died after directing only two weeks of Season 31. As his death came right before a set of episodes was to be taped on location in Las Vegas, <em>Jeopardy!</em> director Kevin McCarthy, a friend of Corwin's, filled in for him. Meanwhile, subsequent tapings in Culver City used associate director Bob Cisneros, followed by a two-week batch done by technical director Robert Ennis before Cisneros was promoted to full-time director. Ennis also directed two weeks in Season 32 due to Cisneros recovering from neck surgery at the time of taping, and became the permanent director at the start of Season 33.</li><li> Due to Pat requiring emergency surgery, Vanna hosted three weeks of episodes in Season 37. The first two had costumed Disney characters in Vanna's usual role (they were part of a Disney-sponsored Christmas week), while the third had Pat's daughter, Maggie, as hostess.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">Halloween Episode</a>: Since 1997, they almost always have a specifically-themed Halloween week, often with spooky music, smoke machines, animatronic gargoyles, and even various "scary" sound effects when a contestant picks an envelope in the Bonus Round.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeliumSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeliumSpeech">Helium Speech</a>: At the end of a 1998 episode, the set was decorated with balloons, and neither Pat nor Vanna could resist.

Another one involved Vanna repeatedly screwing up the line "Highlight your night life" when shooting footage of herself modeling a car; one of the takes had "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoonerism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoonerism">Highlight your knife light.</a>"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisAndHers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisAndHers">His and Hers</a>: In the late 1980s to early 1990s, his-and-hers cars were sometimes up for grabs in the Bonus Round.

For the first pilot he was "crazy drunk", badgering a contestant who wanted to solve for $1,300 into spinning again; he kind of improved for the second pilot to "happy drunk", saying "Whee!" at some points.</li><li> In January 2012, Pat Sajak revealed he and Vanna used to get drunk during their two-and-a-half-hour breaks between taping during the Burbank era. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">He later revealed</a> that this was an exaggeration.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InflationNegation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InflationNegation">Inflation Negation</a>:<ul><li> Buying a vowel.

At the end of the show, he was told that it actually <em>had</em> been used only eight times...except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">that was wrong as well</a> - it was the category's <em>tenth</em> appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpCut">Jump Cut</a>: Present in the days that the mechanical puzzle board was used.

What the home viewer didn't see was the puzzle board getting rolled back into the studio after having that round's puzzle loaded onto it.<ul><li> A rather blatant one shows up in a nighttime bonus round on May 5, 1986: the contestant says the first part of the right answer (AT MY WIT'S END) just before the buzzer, then the rest of it during and after said buzzer. Since they don't have another commercial break, the only option was to stop tape before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">declaring that he won the Pontiac</span>, resulting in a very sloppy edit:<div class="indent"><strong>Pat:</strong> To my ear, it was very tight.

The audience was originally silent, but <em>Wheel</em> added laughter to the clip for the ceremonial 4,000th nighttime show; they also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">added a buzzer right afterward</a>.</li><li> Jump cuts are also present if Pat hits something other than a dollar amount on the Final Spin, or if three (or six) consecutive wrong letters are called in the Speed-Up.</li><li> When a round starts with a cycle of three consecutive lost turns that were edited out, the wide shot of the first spin is that of the original spin whose corresponding letter call was edited out, which always results in a jump cut with the Wheel landing in a different area than where it was originally headed. For example, if the first spin looks like it's about to land on Lose A Turn but ends up on the other side of the Wheel.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>: Pat tends to say this when he has to take away a wedge or token, or show Bonus Round players the prize they lost.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>:<ul><li> During the second 1974 pilot, contestant Roseanne is pressured twice by host Edd Byrnes to keep spinning when she wants to solve. She solves three out of four puzzles, but loses by $90 (although she would have lost by only $40 if not for a scoring error).</li><li> Matthew Fenwick, wanted for two counts of child molestation, appeared on <em>Wheel</em> on March 18, 1998. He won $4,400, but one of his victims recognized him while watching his show and alerted the authorities.

The "ooh"s whenever someone landed on a prize wedge or the top dollar, "Aww"s when someone hit Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, or called a wrong letter, et cetera. The show started using an applause machine again in the mid-2000s, but it's a bit harder to discern.<ul><li> In the 80's, the famous "Look at this studio!" intro was filled with canned reactions to the prizes. One of the most noticeable ones was the sound of men shouting "Yeah!" and "Ow!".</li><li> In the early-to-mid 90's, an "Oooh..." would often sound when the top dollar or prize wedges would whiz by in the overhead shot, even if the Wheel stopped several wedges past.</li><li> In the aforementioned "AT MY WIT'S END" Bonus Round, the "audience" groaned loudly in sync with the buzzer even as the contestant solved.</li><li> Canned audience sounds are becoming more prevalent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> with the occasional delayed gasps when a contestant just misses a Bankrupt, or "ooh"s if someone hits the Million Dollar Wedge.</li><li> The show's social media pages will sometimes upload clips of closing segments. These usually do not contain the extra laughter and applause sounds added in when the episode is shown on TV. One segment involved Pat trying to reveal a letter on the puzzle board to no avail. When it aired on TV, raucous laughter was heard as Pat tried to reveal the letter, but the clip on the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel was the segment exactly as recorded in the studio, which had no laughter at all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustSeeWhatWouldHaveHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustSeeWhatWouldHaveHappened">Let's Just See What WOULD Have Happened</a>:<ul><li> On at least one daytime episode (June 7, 1976), a contestant who solved the Round 3 puzzle early was asked to spin the Wheel to see what she would have landed on; she landed on $1,500 (then the top dollar amount).</li><li> On some early nighttime episodes, if the bonus puzzle was not solved, Pat would sometimes ask if anyone in the audience knew the answer before having Vanna reveal it.</li><li> If a contestant opts not to flip over a Mystery Wedge and solves immediately afterward, Pat will often ask the contestant if s/he wants to see what was on the other side.</li><li> After the bonus round, the prize the contestant was playing for will be revealed whether the contestant actually won it or not (except for the first episode with the W-H-E-E-L envelopes, and a random 2003 episode where Pat simply forgot). Additionally, if they could have won the million dollar prize but didn't land on it on the prize wheel, Pat will usually reveal which space on the wheel held the million after the bonus round is over.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple">Like an Old Married Couple</a>: Parodied on a 1997 episode where, in the final segment, Pat and Vanna are at a table, respectively reading a newspaper and knitting.

In Spain, Paloma L&oacute;pez from 2006-2015, followed by Laura Moure. Olympic rhythmic gymnast Barbara Gonzalez subbed for Laura when she was out with an injury in 2016.

The contestant may choose to take its "face value" of $1,000 (originally $500) per letter, or forfeit that amount and flip it over. If one is flipped over, the other one functions as a regular cash space for the rest of that round.<ul><li> Depending on the game the Bonus Puzzle can be this. Picture it, you get to the last puzzle with a prize on the line, the puzzle is typically something general (typically "Thing(s)") depending on where the R,S,T,L,N,E end up and how many vowels are in the puzzle (you only get E and one of your own) you could end up filling the whole thing in yourself or end up with an unsolvable puzzle with only a few letters showing on the board.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyCharmsTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyCharmsTitle">Lucky Charms Title</a>: In the show's two-line logo, the "O" in "of" is rendered as a wheel.<ul><li> During Tennis Week in 2018, the "o" in "of" was replaced with a tennis ball, while the wheel-shaped "O" was moved down to replace the one in "fortune".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">Metaphorgotten</a>: At the end of an episode from the first week of Season 21, he and Vanna reminisced on how long they were doing the show.

This often results in the show getting pre-empted by sporting events, award shows, or local special programming. In Boston and Nashville, <em>Wheel</em> is pre-empted at least once a week during football season in favor of locally-produced shows on the cities' NFL teams.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">Mission-Pack Sequel</a>: One of the computer game adaptations, <em>Wheel of Fortune 2003</em>, is pretty much the exact same game as <em>Wheel of Fortune 2nd Edition</em>, with a different puzzle bank and with Vanna's FMV clips redone.

In the 1990s, it wasn't rare to see three- to five-letter answers, often compounded in difficulty by not having any RSTLNE in them. BABY BOY, WIG, WAX, and ZOO all occurred in October 1992 alone (and amazingly, all but WIG were solved; BABY BOY in particular was solved with <strong>no letters showing</strong>). YO-YO and I DO (1993 and 1996, respectively) were also solved.<ul><li> Since about Season 20, the difficulty is usually ramped up by relying heavily on rarely-called letters (e.g. JAZZ BAND), vowels (e.g. OAK BUREAU), arcane and outdated phrases (e.g. WHAT A BUSYBODY), completely arbitrary noun-adjective pairings (e.g. FAVORITE MUG, AVID HIKER, WILDLY HAPPY GUY, WACKY NEIGHBOR(S) {twice!}), or some combination of the above (e.g. JACUZZI BUBBLES).</li><li> Pretty much <em>any</em> bonus puzzle with the word QUIZ in it.</li><li> In rare occurrences, RSTLNE will reveal only the S at the end of a pluralized puzzle (e.g. HIGHWAYS, WHIZ KIDS).</li></ul></li><li> A Clue puzzle in 1993 reading SILENT BUTLER'S TARGETS proved to be this, as none of the contestants <em>or</em> Pat knew what a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_butler">silent butler<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> by the bonus puzzle NEW BABY BUGGY on March 19, 2014, a typical example of the "random adjective/noun pairing" style of bonus puzzle.

The Milton Bradley home games had a rule where players <em>needed</em> to hit the wedge, but this most likely was never the case on the show itself. Regardless, contestants unfairly lost their turn by hitting it without enough money to buy a vowel (such as on the very first spin of the September 5, 1975 show), or after all the vowels had been revealed. By November 3, 1975, the wedges were finally just kicked out.</li><li> Apparently, there was not originally a rule stating that contestants had to solve the puzzle exactly as it appeared on the board, a rule which was supposedly added the day after a contestant was ruled correct despite transposing two words in the answer.</li><li> The addition of Proper Name in 1996, ending more than two decades of "Person does not always mean 'proper name'." reminders (generally, the use of the disclaimer depended on whether or not it <em>was</em> a proper name - if it was given, it wasn't; if it was omitted, it was). Strangely, the reverse is now true: Proper Name can also refer to a business, sports team, college, etc.<ul><li> Even weirder is the retirement of Fictional Place. This means the category Place can also refer to any fictional town, country, etc.</li></ul></li><li> The rename of On the Menu (introduced in Season 21) to Food &amp; Drink in Season 24 seems to be this. Previously, some food-and-drink puzzles were shoehorned into On the Menu (such as BIG GULP, something even Pat called the writers out for), while other foods that wouldn't necessarily be found on a menu were called just Thing <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note90m4d');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note90m4d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note90m4d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(such as CABBAGE)</span> or Around The House <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10dl3x');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10dl3x" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10dl3x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(another egregious example in the bonus puzzle ALMOND JOY)</span>.</li><li> The introduction of the Toss-Up to decide play order. Before, a number draw backstage determined the position of the three players, meaning the person selected in the red (1st) position was always guaranteed to start two puzzles during a game, and quite possibly the yellow (2nd) player as well, leaving the blue (3rd) at a disadvantage. The Toss-Up could also use one as well, since there are two to kick off the show: one before contestant introductions and then one to decide who goes first, which doesn't seem so fair to the person who solved the first one...especially since, no matter who got the first Toss-Up, the red player starts Round 1 if the second goes unsolved.</li><li> Originally, the Free Spin was a regular space on the Wheel, and could be landed on multiple times (the contestant was given a cardboard disc), meaning s/he could stock up several tokens. Many contestants ended up turning in Free Spin after Free Spin and therefore hogging the Wheel, including at least one daytime episode where the blue contestant never got to touch the Wheel at all due to an opponent abusing Free Spins (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">but still ended up winning thanks to a $2,000 Final Spin</a>).</li><li> Starting in Season 30, landing on the &frac12; Car tags, Wild Card, Gift Tag, or Prize wedge now award both the extra and $500 per letter. Previously, it awarded just cardboard, which can be rather disappointing if one lands on the Wild Card and calls a letter that's up there several times.</li><li> As mentioned above, the two changes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>: first, by offering RSTLNE automatically, and second, by forcing the contestant to pick a random prize.</li><li> Reducing the cost of vowels on the daytime version after it moved to CBS to compensate for the drastically-lowered budget, as mentioned above.</li><li> Adding $1,000 to the value of the Final Spin in 1999 to reduce the number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusions</a> (although sometimes this can over-compensate).</li><li> In Season 25, the Wheel had a "Big Money Wedge" that shuffled between penalties and flat cash amounts up to $25,000. Originally, there was presumably no rule about using the Wild Card for an extra consonant on one of the cash amounts. When one contestant managed to do this (albeit for a wrong letter), a rule was quickly enforced stating that the Wild Card could not be used on the wedge except in its post-claim $1,000-per-letter state. Although the show has many game-breakers, the potential to earn $50,000 from as little as two consonants was understandably not going to fly.</li><li> In an October 2016 episode, a Crossword Puzzle used an arrangement of four horizontal words and one vertical word down the middle built entirely off of letters from the other four, making it difficult to discern. Although the contestant did include the vertical word when solving, there was a long pause before Pat ruled her correct, possibly not noticing the word himself. This type of arrangement was never used again.</li><li> Due to strict limitations in the UK, the British version originally had an either-or trivia question <em>every</em> time the Wheel changed hands; get it wrong, lose your turn. After at least the first two series, they realized it slowed games to a crawl and changed it to a toss-up question at the start of each round.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a>:<ul><li> It used to be that only <em>some</em> games had Speed-Up rounds, and having one was more the exception; since late 2000, every game has one to bring a definitive "end" to gameplay and level the playing field a bit.</li><li> When they were first introduced in Season 21, Prize Puzzles occurred at random throughout the week.

Notably, contestants only seem to use it when he does this (except for its first season of use where several players used it on three-digit amounts). On some occasions, he forgets; on others, he convinces them to use it on non-top dollar amounts; and on at least one occasion, he was about to convince a player to use it on $3,500, but was cut off by him asking to solve.</li><li> If a contestant buys a vowel and the puzzle has at least one more vowel yet to be revealed, Pat will usually say something to the effect of "You can buy another."</li><li> When a puzzle nears completion and all the multiples are gone, Pat will often try to indirectly entice the contestant to solve by recapping their current score followed by something along the lines of "What do you think?".</li><li> More prevalent in the 80's, when the show's rule set wasn't second nature to all players: after a player's turn ended with a puzzle at near-completion, if the next player looked indecisive about spinning or solving, Pat would remind them they could solve without having to spin.</li><li> If a contestant asks to solve while using the Express wedge, Pat will remind them they can call letters until the puzzle is completed for maximum earnings.</li><li> When a contestant is ready to solve a Crossword Clue, Pat will tell them "say everything, don't add anything", which is a reminder to the contestant that even adding "and" before the final word would nullify their response.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">Press X to Die</a>:<ul><li> There's a Used Letter Board out of camera view to show contestants which letters have been used already (contestants can often be seen looking to the side to check it before choosing their letter). If, despite this, a contestant calls a letter that's already been picked, they forfeit their turn (unless, of course, the contestant is on Free Play).</li><li> However, they're at least kind enough to inform contestants if all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed, even if all five haven't been bought yet. Even so, this has failed to stop at least one contestant.</li><li> Sometimes contestants forget to add an "S" on a pluralized word when solving, or vice versa. This got subverted at least once during a Teen Best Friends week where one contestant rang in on a Toss-Up and said CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE, with her partner quickly adding the S to form the correct answer. Other contestants that have attempted this in recent years are not credited with the solve.</li><li> When solving a Crossword Puzzle, adding an "and" while listing the intersecting words is not acceptable, even if the words themselves were correct.</li><li> There have been several instances of stuck contestants calling an incorrect F with only one or two consonants remaining, even if it wouldn't grammatically fit in any blank (such as BUS_ RESTUARANT KITCHEN).</li><li> On <em>Wheel 2000</em> and some foreign versions, calling a letter in the Bonus Round's original package forfeits that pick.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">Press X to Not Die</a>:<ul><li> The Free Spin served as this trope. Upon losing their turn, a player could turn it in to keep control rather than have play pass to the next player.<ul><li> This trope was invoked literally in the Nintendo 64 game. While most <em>Wheel</em> video games would use a "Yes or No" prompt for using a Free Spin, this version gave the player three seconds to press the A button if they wished to use it. Not pressing A in time resulted in play passing on.</li></ul></li><li> If a contestant gives an incorrect solution to a puzzle, they can quickly give another attempt if neither Pat nor the producers (via the buzzer) have made any comments about the wrong answer. This worked in one contestant's favor in a 2012 episode, where she initially left off the "CASE" when solving the Before &amp; After puzzle LOWERCASE LETTER CARRIER, then gave the correct answer just before Pat could rule her incorrect.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>:<ul><li> The Sony Card used to be ubiquitous, along with the Sony Rewards program, since the show is produced by Sony's television division.</li><li> A few episodes in Season 25 used a separate <em>People</em> category in honor of <em>People</em> magazine. The puzzles were show business-related answers that could be found in the magazine.</li><li> Beginning in the late 2000s, Maxwell House sometimes sponsors the Bonus Round. Any wins result in the company donating $2,500 to a Rebuilding Together fund.</li><li> Throughout Season 31, Sony cameras were provided along with Prize Puzzle trips.</li><li> Providers for trips are often promoted in the copy, such as Collette Vacations.</li><li> The first NES game has <a class="urllink" href="https://tcrf.net/Wheel_of_Fortune_(NES)">unused sprites of the Coca-Cola logo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Similar to the nighttime Prize wedge (picked up when landed on, had to avoid Bankrupt and then solve the puzzle to claim the prize), this Jackpot was an accruing cash prize that began at $1,000 and increased by $1,000 per show until won.</li><li> Played straight by the Spanish version using the "Bote" wedge (which works pretty much the same as the nighttime Jackpot on the American show described above), but also inverted with the "Prueba de Velocidad Decreciente" (Decreasing Speed Round)&mdash;a Toss-up puzzle valued at 2,000 euros that decreases by a set amount for each letter revealed in the puzzle.

Just before November though, the Bonus Wheel and $100,000 prize each made their debut.</li></ul></li><li> If a contestant is completely silent on a difficult bonus puzzle, Pat will claim that he was thinking the same thing after time runs out.

It's actually pretty harsh, as the Prize Puzzle has only ever offered a non-trip prize something like three times.</li><li> Saying "beep beep" or "S/he'll be right down!" after the car horn sound effect whenever a &frac12; Car tag is landed on. Similarly, if a contestant has only one of the &frac12; Car tags after Round 3 (the last round in which they are available), Pat often jokes that it will be parked in the &frac12; garage.</li><li> Joking about the Speed-Up music, particularly if the round is taking a long time.</li><li> Something along the lines of "There would be a federal investigation if you had gotten this" after a contestant fails to solve a bonus puzzle because the letters they picked weren't helpful.</li><li> Saying that the answer to the puzzle was also his nickname in high school, particularly if it involves an adjective ending in Y (such as HEAVY DUMBBELL, LIGHT AND FLUFFY, and PUDGY CHEEKS).</li><li> If a Things puzzle takes the form "Xs and Ys", he will sometimes say "Alive, alive-o" after it's solved (referencing the line "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o" in the folk song "Molly Malone").</li><li> Every Spring, he tells a joke along the lines of "I thought I saw the first robin of Spring, but it turned out to be a pigeon with a chapped breast." Lampshaded in April 2012, where he said that it was the 14th year in a row he'd done that joke.</li><li> "You could buy an alphabet." when a contestant buys a vowel after gaining a lot of spendable cash, usually due to calling a letter that appears more than once on the top dollar value.</li><li> When a Rhyme Time puzzle of the "two or more random things that rhyme" format (example: BEES FLEAS AND MANATEES) is solved, saying that a similar joke puzzle that never actually existed (like DOGS FROGS AND WARTHOGS) was used earlier on the show.</li><li> If several wrong answers are given in a Speed-Up, Pat will often reference the "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5aX32886pQ">Who said anything about a horse?!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" incident.</li><li> On the episode closest to April 21, Pat will often acknowledge the birthday of both his wife, Lesly, and producer Harry Friedman's wife, Judy, in some creative fashion.</li><li> Every time the Prize Puzzle offers a trip to Antigua, Pat references the fact that the staff has to write "Antigua" phonetically on his card due to him always mispronouncing it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RushmoreRefacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RushmoreRefacement">Rushmore Refacement</a>: Done as a credits gag in 2010, with Pat's face replacing Lincoln's.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameLanguageDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameLanguageDub">Same Language Dub</a>:<ul><li> Averted with Jack Clark, who left both versions in early May 1988 (with Charlie O'Donnell and Johnny Gilbert filling in) and died July 21.

By September 5, M.G. Kelly had taken over as announcer.</li><li> Since the show tapes in a very out-of-order fashion, Charlie ended up announcing 40 episodes that didn't air until after his death. <em>Wheel</em> dubbed him over with different announcers and edited out or dubbed over any direct references to him. The official reason was that "it was a tough decision, but it would have been too sad to hear Charlie's voice so close to his death". Fans were...not amused.</li><li> And in Summer 2011, Jim Thornton was dubbed over the other guest announcers (although reruns of episodes originally aired before Charlie's death kept him, including the weekend feed). The official reason was to "establish" Jim, but it really smacked more of cheapness and/or displeasure in the other announcers' work; the smacking got louder in early 2013, when the show used unaired outtakes from the intro of a 2011 episode as the opening retro clip and, despite this and the week not being reshown in Summer 2011, dubbed Jim over John Cramer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>: Some of the specially-themed weeks are given rather intricate set pieces.

They even actually had WHEEL OF FORTUNE as a Toss-Up in 2001, causing Pat to claim that they've "officially run out of puzzles, apparently".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowTheFolksAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowTheFolksAtHome">Show the Folks at Home</a>:<ul><li> The short-lived Preview Puzzle, used only in Season 17. A partially filled in puzzle was shown to the home audience, and after the intro, Vanna would reveal the answer on the puzzle board.</li><li> From the second month of Season 23 through Season 30, the home audience was always shown what is on the other side of a Mystery Wedge if one was landed on. Starting in Season 31, they are now shown only if the contestant declines to flip it over.</li><li> Beginning in Season 36, all letter guesses are accompanied by a subtitle-like graphic displaying that letter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a>: The Crossword Round, given a trial run on the last week of Season 33 and made official in Season 34; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosswordPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosswordPuzzle">Crossword Puzzle</a> above.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep">Sound-Effect Bleep</a>:<ul><li> On January 7, 2013, a contestant forgot that Round 3 was a Prize Puzzle; after being told so by Pat, she exclaimed "Oh crap, I forgot!" The word "Crap" was censored out by the show's buzzer.</li><li> On a Season 6 episode, a contestant unintentionally made a wrong guess in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> that had to be censored with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em> cuckoo.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRound">Speed Round</a>:<ul><li> The Speed-Up round (Final Spin). Vowels worth nothing, consonants worth the amount landed on (plus $1,000 since 1999). Unlike most examples of this trope, Speed-Ups have no overall time limit (although apparently they did very early on), only the three seconds (originally five) that a player is given to solve if they find a letter.</li><li> Another variant is the Express wedge, introduced in Season 31. Whenever a contestant hits the wedge, they can opt to stop spinning and keep calling letters for $1,000 a pop, but calling a wrong letter has the same effect as a Bankrupt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitScreen">Split Screen</a>: Always used during Speed-Ups (contestants on top and puzzle on bottom, although early episodes had this reversed), and on Toss-Ups for all but their first season of use.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler">Spoiler</a>:<ul><li> On current-day episodes, if two contestants in a row either call a wrong or repeated consonant, hit Lose a Turn, or hit Bankrupt when having nothing to lose and the third contestant in line spins a dollar amount, it is a near-guarantee that the letter called on this spin will be in the puzzle, otherwise the cycle would have been edited out for time. This can be anticlimactic if, say, the red and yellow contestants hit Lose a Turn back-to-back and the blue contestant hits the top dollar value.</li><li> Whenever the Bonus Round is lost, Pat always spoils when the envelope is $100,000 by opening it, then quickly closing it and attempting to stall before showing it to the camera.</li><li> From Seasons 18-24, if one looked closely at the Wheel during the wide shot before the pre-Round 4 Toss-Up, if the Wheel had only one Bankrupt wedge, this would foreshadow that Round 4 would start with the Final Spin, meaning that Pat has one less invalid wedge to land on. If the second Bankrupt wedge was present, the round would start with regular play. After this period, the second Bankrupt was now always removed, only for it to be changed to always present starting in Season 27.</li><li> The Maxwell House plugs in Season 27: if they aired before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>, it was a loss; if they aired afterward, it was a win. The plugs started in January 2014 originally followed the same pattern, but later averted it.</li><li> In a March 2012 episode, after a contestant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">lost the $100,000</a>, Pat said in the closing segment, "We've given away the $100,000 this season", even though that hadn't happened yet by airing order. The episode referred to was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutofOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutofOrder">taped beforehand</a>, but would not air for another month.</li><li> From the early 2000's through the late 2010's, the show's website would feature a "contestant blog" every week written by one of the week's players. The featured contestant was almost-always someone who won their game.</li><li> Until Season 31, when a contestant had to decide whether to flip a Mystery Wedge, its reverse would often be shown to the viewers before the decision was made. Currently, it is only shown when the wedge is not flipped, and never until after such decision is made.</li><li> Since roughly Season 32, if the blue contestant is in control at the time a round goes to Speed-Up, the Final Spin will very likely be close to whatever wedge the blue contestant was on, due to Pat's spin strength.</li><li> For the week of April 16-20, 2018, the show held a special sweepstakes in which each day's winner would have their final total matched to a Wheel Watchers Club member. On the show's website, there was an "Official Rules" document stating that the home viewer prizes would be valued "up to $75,550", heavily implying this would be the week's highest winner's total. When Monday through Thursday went by, all with Bonus Round losses and final totals significantly less than said value, Friday rolled around with the winner going to the Bonus Round with $25,550, spoiling to anyone who read the document that she would win the Bonus Round with the rare $50,000 envelope. Also, she took the Million Dollar Wedge to the Bonus Round, also spoiling that the million would not be won (or lost).</li><li> Currently, the show's social media pages post at least one video highlight from the current day's episode at 8:00 PM Eastern time. Viewers who miss the show or live on the West Coast can infer the Bonus Round outcome based on the content posted. In general, if the clip is the Bonus Round, or a "Best of (contestant)" montage, the Bonus Round was won. If the clip is anything <em>but</em> the Bonus Round, especially something mundane like a contestant's interview or Pat and Vanna's chat at the end of the show, or if no clip is posted at all, it was most likely a loss.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>: The Triple Toss-Ups on December 13, 2019 in the category of "Food &amp; Drink" had this: PEPPERONI PIZZA, PICKLED PEPPERS, and DOUBLE HELPING OF PEAS.

Although it is picked up off the Wheel in most episodes, it is rarely actually used. Most often, it is either lost to Bankrupt, or it ends up not being used at all with the contestant who earned it not making it to the Bonus Round. When it does get used, it's mostly in the Bonus Round as a result of the contestant avoiding Bankrupts and having no beneficial opportunities to use it during the main game. Since the card lets you call a second consonant without having to spin again, arguably the only good time to use it is when the player is sitting on the top dollar value. In addition, most of its uses in the main game are due to inconsistent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerNudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerNudge">player nudges</a> by Pat.</li><li> In the Shopper's Bazaar pilot, one contestant earned a Free Spin and continually had opportunities to use it to keep her turn, but she declined every time and ended up never using it before the game ended.</li><li> Among the few circulating episodes where it gets picked up, the short-lived Double Play token often went unused.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a>:<ul><li> The "Slang" category (1992-95), where the slang used was almost always dated, obscure, or just plain nonexistent ("OFF THE BEAM", "LET'S CUT OUT OF HERE", "THE BLAHS", etc.).</li><li> Still happens now and then.

Nearly every preview shows contestants landing on or picking up prizes, the $10,000 side of the Mystery Wedge, or the Million-Dollar Wedge, or celebrating after solving a puzzle with their score in plain sight. They also often feature contestants screaming after Pat tells them they've won a trip, spoiling which contestant wins the Prize Puzzle (and likely that episode's game).

When the episode aired, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">she lost it to Bankrupt</a>.</li><li> The promo for the week of May 27, 2013 outright stated there would be a $1,000,000 win that week, showing very brief footage of <em>when in the game the Million-Dollar Wedge was hit</em> (Round 2, with the Mystery Wedge being visible and the Prize wedge sitting on the yellow contestant's arrow) and the big winner celebrating. It only became more obvious (still before it aired) when said $1,000,000 winner posted the week's contestant blog &#151; part of her outfit could clearly be seen in the promo during the "post-win" clip, which showed a group of people hugging among raining confetti.</li><li> The promo for the week of September 15, 2014 was even more blunt. As a black screen is displayed, Pat's voice is heard saying "Could you use a million dollars?" followed by a contestant screaming. This was also strongly hinted even earlier by a still posted online showing Pat holding a Bonus Round envelope open before a contestant hunched over in excitement. Although the contestant's head and envelope's prize were censored, it was still obvious what the still was showing, especially for eagle-eyed fans who knew that the $100,000 and $1,000,000 envelopes use a different variant of the <em>Wheel</em> logo than all the other envelopes, which was in plain sight in the still.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange">Truck Driver's Gear Change</a>: The 1983-2000 theme, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Changing Keys</a>". Incidentally, the name became somewhat of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a> for the 1994 and '97 remixes, which had virtually no key changes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">Two Decades Behind</a>:<ul><li> While the show's "Song Title", "Song Lyrics", and "Song/Artist" categories are fairly common, the songs used for their puzzles are almost-always from the 1980s or earlier, even if it's a teen or college week. This appears to be intentional; occasionally, there is a puzzle that <em>could</em> be considered a lyric or title of a song later than the 80s, but they will put it under a generic category (for example, MAKE MY WISH COME TRUE, a line from Mariah Carey's 1994 holiday hit <em>All I Want for Christmas is You</em>, was categorized as Phrase). Despite this, they do sometimes use the <em>name</em> of a currently-popular artist in a Proper Name, Show Biz, or Crossword puzzle.</li><li> The show still sometimes uses outdated slang in "Phrase" puzzles, including multiple instances of the word TOTALLY in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> and "OUT OF SIGHT!" in 2018.</li><li> One College Week episode in 2014 had a Toss-Up of REVENGE OF THE NERDS under the category "The 80s" (which was likely before any of the week's contestants were born). Two contestants rang in with incorrect guesses, obviously not being familiar with the movie.</li><li> May 28, 2018: The Toss-Up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a> went unsolved, with no one being familiar with the 80s television series. It didn't help that the K was the last letter to be revealed, leading to two incorrect guesses starting with WARP. Afterwards, one contestant commented, "We're 90's kids."</li><li> The show's current events category, "Headline", has become increasingly rare in recent seasons to the point of sometimes not appearing for over a year. Nowadays, when it does get used, it is usually related to a recent sports victory or an astronomical event.</li><li> The very few puzzles <em>Wheel</em> has used related to gaming have only involved arcade classics such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a></em>.</li><li> And in a zig-zag of this trope, Classic TV has only appeared twice since the mid-2000s.</li><li> Jokingly averted by Pat on the Season 29 premiere, where he quipped that to keep up with the times, "Every puzzle will include the word 'Kardashian'." Ironically, said name still has yet to appear in any puzzle.</li><li> A Song Lyrics puzzle SURF CITY HERE WE COME (from the 1963 song <em>Surf City</em> by Jan and Dean) has been used as a Toss-Up twice, in 2014 and 2020. In the 2014 episode, it was incorrectly solved as "SURF CLAY WHERE WE GO". In the 2020 episode, it was again incorrectly solved, this time as "NEW YORK CITY HERE WE COME", and it was not solved until there was only one letter left.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">Understatement</a>: Pat, to million-dollar winner Michelle Loewenstein. "You may be one of our bigger winners." He didn't say anything similar to the second $1,000,000 winner (Autumn Erhard), even though...you know...she took the "biggest <em>Wheel</em> winner" record from Michelle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">Undesirable Prize</a>: Arguably every shopping-era prize that wasn't a car, all-expenses-paid vacation, or possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">fur coat</a> could count, but everyone remembers the $154 ceramic Dalmatian. The late 80s-early 90s also had some real stinkers in the Bonus Round, such as a build-your-own log cabin kit, a silver tea serving set, a "shipboard party" (something that even Pat made fun of), or historical documents signed by famous people. Arguably, the gift tags could also fall under this, depending on whether or not someone actually wants a Lobstergram or a $1,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kmart">Kmart</a> shopping spree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a>:<ul><li> The sudden switch to playing for cash in 1987, then the announcement that it would be permanent after originally intended to be a one-month stint.</li><li> Contestants now being given RSTLNE for free in the Bonus Round in 1988.</li><li> The trial of the &frac12; Car wedges (which would make a permanent debut as the &frac12; Car tags), during a Road Trip week in 2011.</li><li> The addition of Crossword Puzzles in 2016.</li><li> Contestants now being allowed to choose their Bonus Round category starting in 2017.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>: A wedge variant in Buy A Vowel. Its redundancy from the 1973 pilot suggests it was meant to simulate the "impulse buy" that may or may not backfire, putting it closer to Lose A Turn and Bankrupt than Free Spin. Strangely, the wedge wasn't actually present for Round 1 on the '74 pilots, and the thing never even came into play for the first <em>two</em> pilots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriasSecretCompartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriasSecretCompartment">Victoria's Secret Compartment</a>: On a 2011 episode, Pat was talking to Vanna about being cold, and how you have "handwarmers or footwarmers or..." and she pulls two warmers out of the top of her dress, saying "They have to stay warm." <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note144exf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note144exf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note144exf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Boobwarmers?)</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution">Vocal Evolution</a>: Charlie's voice got deeper not long after he returned to the show in 1989. He also had a spell throughout most of the 1990s where he was noticeably mellower, but actually became only <em>more</em> enthusiastic come the 2000s (see above).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfDramatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfDramatic">Voice of Dramatic</a>: Charlie O'Donnell. Starting in the late 1990s, if someone won the $25,000 in the Bonus Round, he would let them know that they'd just won "twenty-five <em><strong>THOOOOOOOUUUUSAND</strong></em> dollars!" This, of course, also applies to any other amount of money won ever since figures higher than $25,000 were offered starting in 2001-02. Averted with Jack Clark and Jim Thornton, who have more subdued deliveries.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunction</a>:<ul><li> Vanna has confirmed that she once split a zipper mid-taping, and finished the episode in a different dress.</li><li> On the March 8, 2013 episode, Pat popped a button off his jacket during the Final Spin. Even though the wardrobe department was able to get him a new button during the commercial break, he wore stage manager John Lauderdale's jacket for the rest of the show as a joke.</li><li> Narrowly averted in an late-March/early-April 1988 episode when Vanna walked into a pool as one episode ended; getting her dress soaked. She then began to stand up before realizing her dress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear">has become transparent</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxingLyrical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxingLyrical">Waxing Lyrical</a>: On a 2004 episode, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS</a> was the answer to a "Fictional Character" puzzle, Pat quipped "What do you mean, 'fictional'? He lives in a pineapple under the sea! Absorbent and yellow and porous is he!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy">Whammy</a>: Bankrupt and Lose A Turn. At least the latter lets you keep your cash/prizes/etc. The show provides the page image.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereWhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereWhere">"Where? Where?"</a>: A common quip from Pat whenever the announcer introduces him and Vanna at the top of the show is to say "Where are they?" in response.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap">Who Writes This Crap?!</a>: Pat has never been afraid to mock the puzzle writers:<ul><li> When a contestant was tasked to solve DESE DEM AND DOSE GUYS on a 1989 episode, Pat outright called it a "crummy puzzle".</li><li> Pretty much every instance of Megaword in the 1994-95 season, to the point that even Vanna and Charlie joined in on occasion. When Trent Girone, a huge fan and contestant with a learning disability, brought it up in a 2014 episode (after Pat challenged him to name a retired category), he said that he "hated every minute of it".</li><li> February 24, 2012: After the Prize Puzzle I LOVE MY PASSPORT PHOTO was solved, Pat remarked that he's never heard anyone say that. The contestant who solved it agreed.</li><li> June 13, 2013: Following the Round 2 puzzle LIVE-IN NANNY GOAT, Pat sighed and discouragedly said "I know <em>exactly</em> who wrote that."</li><li> On November 25, 2020, a contestant called out the writers for using OVEN in a Crossword round that had the clue "Kitchen ____". He questioned "who calls it a kitchen oven?", leading Pat to throw a mock tantrum and jokingly call the contestant "ungrateful".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingThroughTheCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingThroughTheCold">Working Through the Cold</a>:<ul><li> Pat obviously had a cold for the second "Wipeout Week" during Season 6 (February 6-10, 1989), as he sounded congested throughout and the mics picked up several sniffles and coughs.</li><li> Pat hosted two weeks of episodes from San Francisco in November 1996 despite coming down with laryngitis at the time. By the end of the week, his voice was nearly gone, so he and Vanna traded places in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">You Keep Using That Word</a>:<ul><li> At least once, Thornton told the contestant they won a "cash advance" in the Bonus Round. It certainly isn't a "loan taken out against a line of credit or credit card, typically imposing higher-than-normal interest charges" (as Investopedia says).</li><li> Pat will often refer to the "season number times $1,000" prize in the Bonus Round as the "minimum", although the value of the car prize (especially since Season 33) is usually lower.</li><li> A common theme done at least once per season nowadays is "Big Money", but despite this name, the "money" offered is exactly the same as it is in any other given episode. "Big Money" weeks in years past usually did have some kind of special raise in stakes, however.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSayTomato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSayTomato">You Say Tomato</a>: In one episode, Pat pointed out that Charlie says "ca-RIB-be-an" and he says "CARE-uh-be-an". He then added that he says "Wheel of Fortune" while Charlie says, quote, "Wheeeeeeeeeeel of Fortune".</li></ul></div><hr>
