Spent several months struggling to overcome speech aphasia related to his gunshot injury and nearly lost his new girlfriend because he was too darn stubborn to let her in on what was happening. Then, said girlfriend was abducted and nearly killed before Mac found her.</li><li> Danny: Has been framed for murder <em>twice</em>. The second time, his brother ended up in a coma while trying to clear Danny's name. He's gotten in trouble more than once for losing his temper with suspects. For a while he was suspected of shooting an undercover cop and it caused problems between him and Mac for almost a season. His neighbor's son got shot while Danny was looking after him. Was in a wheelchair from a motive-less shooting. Had his wallet (with ID, credit cards, and badge) stolen by Shane Casey. And then Shane Casey tried to kill him, fell to his death (not!), broke into his and Lindsay's apartment and threatened to kill their daughter, only stopped by Lindsay's shot. Later, he became a sergeant, only to have one of his rookies shoot the wrong man when two guys threatened the group, which had gone out for a drink.(One guy had a gun, but the rookie cop shot the other one.) On top of that, he was accused of having an affair because the same rookie was seen cozying up to him on a surveillance camera tape. She then lied and said Danny told her to lie, nearly costing him his job, though he was cleared when Lindsay pressured the rookie to tell the truth.</li><li> Stella: Orphan, with lingering if mostly well-hidden issues as a result. Had to shoot a stalker ex-boyfriend and had her apartment burnt out by a next-door neighbor. Discovers that the professor whom she regarded as a father figure was an art thief and kept the fact that he knew her mother a secret for years (and judging from his confession that he loved her mother gives the implication that he may have been her father). Then when she confronts him, the professor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">takes a bullet for her</a> from his brother and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">dies in her arms</a>.</li><li> Lindsay: Witnessed her friends' murder and has been dealing with the lingering trauma ever since. Married Danny who kept secrets from her and was in a wheelchair. Later became traumatized after killing Shane Casey in her own home. Had to listen to accusations Danny was cheating on her after the incident with Danny and his group of rookie cops, though it was untrue.</li><li> Flack: Alcoholic sister. Had to arrest his mentor for tampering with a crime scene, which caused problems between him and Mac and between him and the rest of the PD.

Was held hostage and tortured so the criminals could get access to the lab. In the episode 'The Party's Over,' it's hinted that he may have OCD. His job also seems to be perennially in danger, first from budget cuts and then from one of the other lab techs. He also happened to be playing street hockey when a car bomb went off right next to him. His very secret shame is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he slept through 9/11. He made up for it by going to "The Pile" the next day, although depending on how long he was there he could now be susceptible to cancer</span>.
