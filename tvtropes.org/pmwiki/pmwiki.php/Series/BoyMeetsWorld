But the show's not really about her, so that's fine. Cory's best friend, Shawn, lives in a trailer park and has eternal problems with his father. Living next street over from and sharing a fence with the Matthews is Cory's teacher Mr. Feeny, always there to spout wisdom to Cory, Eric, his parents, or whoever else might need it.

In light of this, there were several jokes about her name throughout the series.</li><li> All of the Matthews family besides Cory and Eric arguably becomes this starting in Season 6. As neither Cory nor Eric lives at home at this point, and as they are now adults and more or less on their own, there isn't necessarily a need for their parents or pre-teen sister to appear as members of the main cast, but as they were established characters who'd been around since the beginning they were kept in the opening credits and started appearing in roughly half the episodes rather than most or all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>: Cory had married Topanga by the end of the series.

A few minutes later he walks back in utterly confused, saying "I don't know where I am".</li><li> An example of them both being asleep occurs in Mr. Turner's class, and Mr. Feeny walks in. When Shawn and Cory wake up, Shawn complains that "Now I don't know which class I slept through!"</li><li> In the opening scene of season two's "Wake Up, Little Cory", virtually the entire class is falling asleep as Mr. Turner is teaching a lesson on the Shakespeare play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a></em>. Ironically as Mr. Turner states that Shakespeare's plays have continued to keep people "glued to their seats" today, Shawn promptly falls out of his chair, still asleep. Cory &#150; who like the rest of the class, was awakened by the event &#150; then proceeds to (while still sitting in his chair) stomp Shawn awake with his right foot, Shawn then says to Mr. Turner "these chairs really aren't the best for sleeping".</li><li> "The Psychotic Episode" has one that's both funny and serious. Cory has been having nightmares about killing Shawn, so he (naturally) tries not to sleep.

There are at least two explanations of Eric and Cory's hair styles (one episode says Cory's hair is curly because of a Blonde Babysitter curling it on new years eve, stating the norm is like Eric's, and a few episodes later, Eric's straight hair is attributed to taking a ride in the dryer in the 5th grade, stating that the norm is like Cory's). Other variations include the embarrassing first name of Vader (being Leslie or Francis). Don't even get started on the various relations that pop in and out of existence. In the case of Eric's hair vs. Cory's hair, considering Alan, Amy and Eric all have wavy, sandy hair and only Cory has the black curls, one would have to assume Eric's is the norm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuccaneerBroadcaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuccaneerBroadcaster">Buccaneer Broadcaster</a>: In "On the Air", Cory and Shawn form their own pirate radio station at school after Mr. Feeny kicks them off the school's station for turning their show from a dull Q&amp;A session into the much more inappropriate "Lunchtime Lust".

The next episode follows suit with Feeny clearly telling Cory he expects better out of him. It's obvious he's aware of Cory's scheme but decides to let it play out. This continues with Feeny taking advantage of any moment to teach Cory that presents himself with him even agreeing to switch places with him for the rest of the week.</li><li> Eric also starts the first few episodes with a girlfriend named Heather. In the first episode Eric lacks any confidence with girls and believes he blew his date with Heather by making a fool of himself. She disappears quickly (it's later revealed she dumped him) after a few episodes. There's also another girl, Linda, that seems significant but she disappears as well.

Also, he's little more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">Satellite Character</a> until "Model Family", when he gets his own storyline and a best friend (Jason). Heck, Morgan had already her own storyline in "Class Pre-Union". Arguably, "It's a Wonderful Night" is focused more on him than Cory. These episodes would become more common in the later seasons.</li><li> Shawn's poverty isn't established until later in the season. It's not apparent that his family is any less well off then Cory's in early episodes. In an early episode, his dad does get laid off, but it's not apparent that his family is blue collar, as it's not until "Class Pre-Union" that his father's occupation is even mentioned; and not until "Risky Business" that any mention of a trailer is made (it's his uncle's). "The Fugitive" is really the first establishing episode of Shawn being from the other side of the tracks.</li><li> Topanga while just a guest character in Season 1 is mostly absent early on, with her first appearance not until the 4th episode, then disappearing for the next few only to be featured more regularly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFailure">Elevator Failure</a>: In "The Psychotic Episode", Cory has a nightmare where he pushes all of his friends down an empty elevator shaft in Jack and Rachel's apartment building.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives">Elvis Lives</a>: One episode had a one-off gag where Elvis is one of Alan Matthews' poker buddies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName">Embarrassing First Name</a>:<ul><li> Cory's real name is Cornelius.</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Cory:</strong> Shh!

By Season 7, his stupidity had become the defining aspect of his character, to the point that he was often a physical threat to the people around his, and his family viewed him as an embarrassment.

From that point forward, most of his interactions are with Jack (and later Rachel). Eric being one of the "old" characters but having most of his interactions with the "new" ones enabled him to serve as the "bridge" in the conflict that breaks out between the two camps in "The War" and "Seven the Hard Way".</li><li> Although a major plotline of season 5 is Shawn reconnecting with his long-lost half-brother Jack, the two don't interact much after Shawn moves out of their apartment to go to college (where he shares a dorm with Cory) - by this time, most of Jack's reactions revolve around his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartner">Heterosexual Life-Partner</a> Eric, and his newly-introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Rachel.

Because the series went through so many, the continuity of the show was never stable. At the start of the series, Cory was 6th grader while Eric was a Sophomore in High School. At some point during High School Cory, Shawn, and Topanga got aged up two years. In later series, the show also rewrote how romantic Cory and Topanga was. In the first season, Cory wasn't friends with her while the later seasons would have you believe they were inseparable since the age of 2.

Near the end of the episode, Eric feels guilty for having cheated on the tests and confesses to Mr. Feeny about his actions without mentioning Torie's involvement. Unfortunately for Torie, she comes in and blames Eric for telling her on Feeny...though that was what she thought Eric said during the conversation and indirectly confesses to Feeny, who scolds her for her lack of faith on Eric but doesn't fire her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord">Scare Chord</a>: Parodied in the slasher movie-themed episode.

It included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames">Parody Names</a> of the characters and actors: Cory became Rory, Shawn became Shane and Eric became Derek. Ben Savage became "Ben Sandwich", and Rider (Strong) became "Schneider". However, the most punny name came when they mentioned that Ben Sandwich has a brother named "Bread Sandwich", a reference to Ben Savage's brother Fred Savage (from "The <strong>Wonder</strong> Years"). The personalities of the actors are completely flipped from the personalities of their regular characters (Ben Sandwich is a jerk, Schneider is terrified of most human interaction, Topanga's unnamed analogue is flirtatious with Schneider, and Jack's unnamed analogue is abrasive toward Eric). Furthermore, the show takes an opportunity to mock its formula, as Ben Sandwich rants about the idea that Rory makes the same mistakes every week and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">never learns from them</a>.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> continues <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">the gag</a> by showing Will Friedle react explosively to Ben Savage's flub of a line.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a>: Received one in 2014, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GirlMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GirlMeetsWorld">Girl Meets World</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexEqualsDeath">Sex Equals Death</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed Trope</a> in "And Then There Was Shawn". After the killer has already killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Kenny</a> and Mr. Feeny, everyone wonders who will be next. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> Shawn announces that virgins never die - prompting Eric and Jack to announce their impeding death (and to celebrate Feeny's demise). Cory thanks Topanga for saving him, and Shawn remarks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalVirgin">he'll get as sick as you can possibly get without actually dying</a>. (Angela, who is also present, makes no comment one way or the other.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is interestingly played deadly straight; the only survivors by the end are the three confirmed virgins, Cory, Topanga, and Shawn.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">Series Continuity Error</a>: The show was really bad at trying to keep continuity straight. a whole page could probably be made of the inconsistencies especially minor issues such as the norm of hair for the family.<ul><li> Cory and Topanga's relationship is a weird one. Season 1 shows Cory antagonistic towards Topanga, which begins to change by the end of the season in "Boy Meets Girl". However season 3 suggests they were life long lovers; season 4 manages to somewhat correct this by having Cory explain that when he was 7 Eric convinced him girls were yucky so he flung dirt at her for 6 years, a period Cory refers to <em>the lost years</em>. This is fairly plausible as Cory in early seasons is shown to be heavily influenced by anything Eric says. It's also worth pointing out in "Boy Meets Girl" that Amy doesn't understand Cory asking out a girl he constantly picks on, until she thinks for a moment and realizes it doesn't sound quite so strange after all.</li><li> Shawn's Girlfriends: "The First Girlfriends Club" in season 5 doesn't seem to get Shawn's dating history correct. "I Love you, Donna Karan" states that Shawn never goes out with any girl longer than two weeks and never has until Angela. This would make it seem odd that he went out with Dana 6 months earlier; however Dana had last been seen midway through season 3. The same episode also states that he also made plans with Jennifer and Libby, Jennifer hadn't been seen since mid season 4 and Libby was no more significant than any other girls Shawn had interacted with and hadn't been seen since early season 3.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsRiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsRiteOfPassage">Sex as Rite-of-Passage</a>: On their prom night Cory and Shawn say it will be "the night we leave as boys and come back as men", and both try to persuade their respective girlfriends to have sex for the first time. Cory and Topanga almost go through with it, but decide not to in the end, and Shawn and Angela, well... the episode ends without resolving that plotline and it's not (explicitly) mentioned in subsequent episodes, though the implication is that they did go through with it; Shawn dumps Angela pretty much the minute they get to Pennbrook and doesn't really date anyone for the rest of his freshman year, but somehow he's not a virgin anymore when Cory brings up that he still is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">Sex Sells</a>: In-universe example. In "How to Succeed In Business", Shawn gets a job as the assistant to an advertising executive and is asked to come up with ideas from a toothpaste campaign. Shawn thinks of a "sexy fresh breath" campaign but Cory recommends he choose a bacteria-based campaign because "sex does not sell". Shawn of course chooses the sexy breath one which the boss ends up liking.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a>: Played with in one episode. Topanga suddenly becomes self-conscious about her looks, and decides to get a makeover. However, Cory and Shawn recognize that she was already beautiful before getting "cleaned up" and now with the makeover she will be "mega-beautiful", and sure enough she stuns them when she walks out of the beauty parlor. At the end of the episode she decides not to keep up the new appearance because it's not who she is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">She Is All Grown Up</a>: Cory has this reaction about Topanga.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>: Shawn for Cory and Topanga, Cory and Topanga for Shawn and Angela, and <em>everyone</em> for Mr. Feeny and Dean Bolander.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>: The Cory/Topanga pairing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconned</a> into being a lifelong true love during season 4; the two got together for the first time in the season 3 premiere. Before that, though, there were a few hints, including the kiss against the lockers from her debut appearance in early season 1, and the "You are you and I am I" speech from late season 2. Cory's relationship with Topanga in season one could be a symptom of the lifelong true love as he constantly picked on her possibly because he cared about her so much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow">Shouldn't We Be in School Right Now?</a>: Although a lot of scenes take place in school and the characters' education is an important part of the show, they do seem to have a lot of time to have their own adventures when they should have a lot of school work to do.

The response: "So that I can let this country know I am an engineer."</li><li> In another episode when Eric teaches a citizenship class he says he is the smartest one in the room, and a student says that in his country, he was a nuclear physicist, but Eric tells him that, in America, everyone starts with a clean slate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: Jack's girlfriend Millie pulls one on Eric in "The Witches of Pennbrook".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersSuck">Writers Suck</a>: The writers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em>Kid Gets Acquainted With Universe</em> are shown to be small children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>: In "The Eskimo", Mr. Feeny gives Shawn the goal of acquiring two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> tickets and assigns Cory and Topanga to tag along with him; Topanga not to interfere and Cory to help them both. Shawn enters a contest with tickets on the line involving sitting on a billboard balcony on a freezing winter day... until it's only himself and the eskimo, eating ice cream and only there because he's on vacation for the summer. He gives up and the trio head back to Mr. Feeny to report, thinking they've learned the lesson: That sometimes, life will throw insurmountable obstacles at you, so you should learn to take things more seriously. Mr. Feeny is less than pleased. His <em>real</em> lesson was that sometimes life throws insurmountable obstacles at you, so you better man up and overcome them anyway! Now get your asses back out there and get those tickets! Shawn takes this as a self-realization moment when he remarks that everything difficult he's ever come across, he's folded.
