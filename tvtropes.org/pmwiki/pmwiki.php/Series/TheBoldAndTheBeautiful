The show premiered on March 23, 1987, making it the youngest American soap opera on television; it is also the last remaining half-hour soap opera on network daytime television, in no large part, because its CBS timeslot was abbreviated to allow stations to carry their midday newscasts at noon local time.</p><p>Set in Los Angeles, California, <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em> centers around the fashion industry, the struggles of surviving in such a competitive environment. At the center of the show are two families; the influential and elitist Forrester family &#150; headed by Eric and Stephanie Forrester, founders of the fashion company Forrester Creations, and the once upper-middle class Logan family &#150; primarily headed by oldest daughter Brooke Logan. Both families become integrated together through marriage, affairs, and bitter feuds. Adding to the conflict includes the Marone family, headed by Jackie, and the Spectra family, headed by Sally.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><hr><h2>Provides examples of:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortionFalloutDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortionFalloutDrama">Abortion Fallout Drama</a>: Morgan DeWitt, an ex-girlfriend of Ridge's came to town still bitter about the abortion she'd had years ago.

Unlike Ronn Moss (Ridge Forrester #1), who competed two years earlier on that same show, Lang chose to temporarily set up residence with her family in Italy, resulting in Brooke being written off as going there as well. She returned in January 2015, after she was eliminated from <em>Ballando con le stelle</em>.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Lindsey Godfrey (Caroline Spencer) was written out of the show temporarily twice within the course of a year for two different reasons: In June 2014, Godfrey gave birth to a daughter (with then-boyfriend and later, briefly, fianc&eacute;e <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless">Robert Adamson</a>); the pregnancy was not written into the show, even though her character was married to Rick Forrester (played by Jacob Young) and even contemplated having children with him. The second incidence, resulting from a near-fatal auto-pedestrian accident, is detailed under Written-In Infirmity in the YMMV page.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAdultery">Accidental Adultery</a>: Morgan sends Ridge a fake email supposedly from Taylor, granting him permission to sleep with Morgan and father her baby.

Taylor's alcoholism tends to resurface when she's under deep stress. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately, her relapse caused her to temporarily lose custody of her son, Jack.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: Without a doubt, Stephanie and Brooke, although they sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">got along</a>. In fact, Brooke was the last person Stephanie saw when she died of cancer in 2012, with the two finally putting their adversarial relationship beside them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMedicine">Artistic License &#150; Medicine</a>: In a crossover with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Artistic License &#150; Law</a>, we have Dr. Finnegan's relationship with Steffy. While the show goes out of its way to not truly put them together until Steffy is officially no longer his patient, the fact remains that this relationship breaks every kind of doctor-patient ethics law that exists, for the exact reasons that Liam brings up. This kind of relationship compromises a doctor's objective thinking and would get his medical license suspended as soon as it becomes public, <em>former</em> patient or not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt">At Least I Admit It</a>: Steffy Forrester has recently meddled in on relationships and is unabashed about it.

It's quite despicable in the first place, even more so when a retcon reveals that Massimo Marone is Ridge's father and that Stephanie had to have known there was a possibility of this. Eric often throws this in Stephanie's face whenever he's caught in an affair. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doesn't quite explain though why Eric goes crawling back to Stephanie after all his affairs end.</span><ul><li> Also, when Sly poked a hole in the condom he planned to use while having sex with Jessica, hoping to get her pregnant so that he could "do the right thing" and marry her &#150; and get his hands on the Forrester millions. It backfired, as he was too drunk to... complete the deed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>: Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> this happens frequently. Most prominently with Taylor (twice!) and Macy. Some characters, however, stay dead; for example, Stephanie Forrester (due to her portrayer, Susan Flannery's, decision to retire from acting) and Darla Forrester (whose actress, Schae Harrison, has appeared on the show since Darla was killed off in 2007 but only as either a mental illness-induced hallucination or a ghost in a dream sequence).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a>: Compared to the constant drama of the main characters, Rick/Maya is surprisingly stable and sane. Wyatt/Katie is a more recent example, as all their problems are caused by outside forces (i.e., Bill).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a>: Taylor and Brooke for Ridge, respectively. In recent years, the focus was on Hope and Steffy for Liam. However a larger focus had been placed on Wyatt and Liam for Hope since Wyatt's introduction, with Caroline and Maya for Rick getting some steady increase in screen time and plot relevance as well. Liam's tendency to waffle on his feelings for women would later result in a Betty-Betty situation with Hope and Ivy, which Quinn put a stop to by pushing Ivy off a bridge into the River Seine to keep Liam from taking Hope away from Wyatt (Quinn's son). Ivy then became the Betty to Steffy's Veronica after Liam, Steffy and Ridge's takeover of Forrester Creations, and the end of Liam and Ivy's <em>very</em> short-lived marriage due to a misunderstanding regarding Ivy (who's Australian, but a dual U.S.-Australian citizen)'s citizenship status.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a>: Seriously. The Forresters and Logan are tied forever because of the numerous affairs Brooke has had with <em>all the men</em> in the Forrester family, not to mention the children produced from said affairs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>: The 2020 storyline featuring Liam taking Kelly away from Steffy has Liam and Steffy fight, with both of them bringing up accurate points. On the one hand, Steffy is correct that Liam has no right to barge in and invade her privacy the way he did whether he genuinely was worried for her or not, and to take her daughter out of nowhere the way he does is borderline cruel. On the other, Liam is right that Steffy very clearly needs help for her incoming drug problem before it becomes a full-fledged addiction, and his concerns about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">what could've happened to Kelly while Steffy was passed out</a> are all valid.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a>: Steffy Forrester has experienced these two tropes a few times.<ul><li> After Steffy finds out she is pregnant with Liam's child in 2013, leading to them getting married, Steffy miscarries her baby after crashing her motorbike. Upon discovering that the accident has left her infertile, she decides to divorce Liam and move to Paris.</li><li> After returning to L.A. to take over Forrester Creations with Liam and Ridge in 2015, Steffy is repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut Shamed</a> by cousin Aly Forrester<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00ycs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note00ycs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00ycs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">herself broken and resentful of Steffy through a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>, due partly because Steffy's mother Taylor had killed Aly's mother Darla in a DUI-induced auto-pedestrian accident when Aly was a child, and being treated like a servant by Rick and Maya when the former was Forrester Creations' president</span> for "flaunting" her body and attempting to snare Liam from their shared cousin (and Aly's best friend) Ivy. <em>Extremely</em> mentally unstable, Aly attempts to "re-enact" Darla's death<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kkyy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1kkyy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kkyy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">upon urging from a vision of Darla, who appears to Aly as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">floating head</a></span> by trying to run Steffy over on the same stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway where Darla died as her cousin tries to repair the tires on her car (which Aly punctured) when it breaks down. Steffy &#150; unsuccessful in trying to talk her cousin down &#150; is nearly killed by Aly with a tire iron, which Steffy kills Aly with in self-defense when she tries to bludgeon Steffy with a rock. Adding to the trauma, a resentful Ivy (a witness to Aly's death, who ends up making veiled accusations that Steffy murdered Aly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note287xr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note287xr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note287xr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Steffy, who initially blocked out the self-defense killing in shock, told a police officer on-scene that Aly died after tripping and falling on a rock</span>, not knowing the real story) decides to use a cell phone video she taped of Aly's killing (which makes <em>Steffy</em> appear as the aggressor) to blackmail Thomas into making her a lead model of the "California Freedom" fashion line (under the guise of trying to honor Aly's legacy by trying to keep the line from becoming "overt" &#150; sexualized &#150; than if Steffy was in it), in exchange for her silence. Insisting that Steffy lied about the self-defense claim, Ivy even chastises Wyatt (whom she catches trying to delete the video upon Steffy's urging) for "siding" with Steffy's account, forcing him to back down when she expresses her own loneliness. The fact Ivy even used blackmail to keep the tape under wraps from the police was even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading">Lampshaded</a> by Ivy as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">out-of-character</a> for her. Then after the video is deleted, during a confrontation with Ivy over her kissing Thomas while still dating Wyatt (resulting in Wyatt breaking up with Ivy), Steffy accidentally electrocutes Ivy on a broken electrical panel, resulting in Steffy being slapped with a restraining order; she then accidentally injures Ivy <em>again</em> on the staircase during an argument over her feelings for Liam as Ivy prepares to return to Australia. So to summarize, she nearly gets killed by one cousin, kills said cousin in self-defense, and is blackmailed by another cousin, whom she nearly kills by accident twice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpBonfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpBonfire">Break-Up Bonfire</a>: Bridget does this after finding out that her husband Deacon has been sleeping with her mother and gotten her pregnant.

Not only has Ridge overshadowed him for most of his life, but he's had to deal with Stephanie's obvious favoritism towards Ridge. The fact that he exposed Eric's plot to elope with Brooke wasn't enough to turn Stephanie away. He's also repeatedly accused (primarily by Ridge) of being an idiot and a loser with no original ideas.

Then came Caroline Spencer, who conspired to keep them apart and eventually snagged Rick. In addition to becoming a rival to Caroline, she flips between a woman who wants to redeem herself and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Manipulative Bitch</a>. She then is shifted towards more of a heroine role <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she is revealed to be transgender</span>.</li><li> Quinn Fuller's personality change is explainable through a plot point in separate storylines in 2014 and 2015. When her son Wyatt (who is revealed to have tried to deal with his mother's erratic behavior for years) begins dating Hope, whom his half-brother had been in an on-again/off-again relationship with, Quinn tries by any means to keep Liam from interfering, leading her to threaten to murder him and actually try to chop him with a machete! When Quinn returns after allegedly admitting herself in a mental health institution, she threatens Brooke to stay away from Deacon (whom Quinn had started seeing at the time), but doesn't go farther than dreaming of stabbing her in the stomach. After that storyline, Quinn has been depicted as still mischievous but quirky, rather than mentally deranged.</li><li> When Aly Forrester was SORASed in 2014, she started as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower">The Wallflower</a> type. However, she seemingly had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> as she went from being a nice girl to mentally troubled and back, twice (the latter was due to her hatred of Taylor for running over Darla when Aly was a kid). Upon her second flip, she grew into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">The Resenter</a> towards Steffy, channeling her hatred of Taylor towards her daughter, and descended into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent">violent behavior</a> by attempting to murder Steffy with a tire iron and a rock, the former of which led to her death by Steffy. Again, this is explainable by way of her mental issues serving as a plot point.</li><li> Ivy Forrester started out as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> when introduced in 2014; however, tied into she flipped to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Manipulative Bitch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">Resenter</a> and persecutorial blackmailer as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> incident caused by Steffy "stealing" then-boyfriend Liam from her (although Liam later states that he chose to leave Ivy &#150; whom he broke up with at Aly's funeral! &#150; for Steffy on his own terms) and then killing their cousin/her best friend Aly in self-defense (though Ivy, who held a cell phone video she took of the killing over Steffy's head and used Aly's death as a means to get ahead in the company, saw it as murder). Ironically, of those who noticed something wrong with her, Quinn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterAlert">Out-of-Character Alert</a> toward her is the most telling, as she was surprised that Ivy started acting like a jerk (and not in a good way).</li><li> In the running for the show's most egregious example of the trope, Thomas Forrester. As an adult (as played by Adam Gregory and Pierson Fod&eacute;), Thomas was a standard Bad Boy Lothario, but the version played by Matthew Atkinson has seen the character devolve into a full-blown sociopath, fueled by a obsessive infatuation with Hope that developed amid his grief over the off-screen sudden death of Caroline from a blood clot hemorrage in the Spring of 2019, causing him to rack up a large amount of amoral actions rivaling those any other soap baddie has committed in such a relatively short timespan. Over the last eight months of 2019 alone, he found out and hid the true identity of Liam and Steffy's adopted daughter Phoebe, who was really Hope and Liam's thought-to-have-been-stillborn daughter Beth, and manipulated multiple people involved in Dr. Reese's cover-up of the faked miscarriage (including Flo and Zoe) in order to prevent Hope from getting back together with Liam; manipulated and basically mentally abused his young son, Douglas, to get closer to Hope and to keep him from revealing the Beth secret; used Brooke accidentally pushing him off a cliff (an incident he survived) after she catches him manhandling Hope, during a failed effort to convince Hope to forgive him for keeping Beth's identity a secret, to drive a marriage-ending wedge between Brooke and Ridge, whom he manipulated into believing he's changed; faked a <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">McLeaning</a> into a vat of acidic chemicals during an incident with Hope, leading her to briefly believe that she accidentally killed him; tries to coerce Hope into having sex with him in exchange for receiving custody of Douglas; drugged Liam and planned to drug Hope; and... oh yeah... caused a <em><strong>vehicular homicide</strong></em> by running Emma off the Pacific Coast Highway to keep her from revealing the truth about Beth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAdulteryBadAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAdulteryBadAdultery">Good Adultery, Bad Adultery</a>: Brooke tends to justify her flings as being part of her 'destiny', though Ridge seems to be the one she considers her soulmate. Also, <em>all</em> of the women Eric has affairs with (and end up leaving Stephanie for) throw this excuse in Stephanie's face, citing her neurotic control smothers Eric and that she needs to let him go. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yet, once these relationships end, Eric will go crawling back to Stephanie and beg her forgiveness.

The third one was also complicated by her advanced age). But in all three cases, she chose to have the baby, and in all cases (even with her miscarrying the third time), the inevitable damage was done.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeteronormativeCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeteronormativeCrusader">Heteronormative Crusader</a>: Aly Forrester grew into this, the result of her inability to cope with losing her mother Darla in a drunk driving accident when she was a little girl and her being mentally unhinged as a result (she actually sees and hears a floating image of her mother's head, for crying out loud!). It results in some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a> against Steffy (Aly's grudge is really against Steffy's mother Taylor) and some not-as-overt judgemental behavior towards Maya, whom like Rick treated her more like a servant after Rick took over at Forrester (though the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Maya's transgender</span> also has something to do with it).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">History Repeats</a>: The Brooke, Ridge and Taylor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> has pretty much been transposed to Hope, Liam and Steffy, with Brooke being the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeddlingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeddlingParents">analog</a> for Stephanie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>!<ul><li> Not only that, <em>Hope</em> is the "Good Girl", the opposite of her mother Brooke, while <em>Steffy</em> is the "Bad Girl", the opposite of her mother Taylor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist By Her Own Petard:</a> This relates to Stephanie's plan with Andy Johnson. At the time, Ridge was engaged to Ashley Abbott, but Brooke was trying to win him back. Stephanie liked Ashley and wanted Brooke to back off, so she hired Andy to seduce Brooke and show Ridge <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> once again</span> what a slut she was. Well, the plan completely backfired on Stephanie. Andy <em>raped</em> Brooke when seducing her didn't work, and Ridge was there to pick up the pieces and help her through it. Tending to her and helping her deal with her rape reawakened Ridge's feelings for Brooke and he dumped Ashley to be with her. Most of all, <em>everyone</em> turned on Stephanie when it was made known she had hired Andy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Hot Scientist</a>: Brooke is actually an incredibly skilled chemist, and one thing that makes her an asset to Forrester Creations is that she created a formula which permanently removes wrinkles from clothing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>:<ul><li> When Katie had an affair with Nick, her niece Bridget's husband, Brooke went into full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> mode and completely railroaded Katie for hurting Bridget. However, Brooke had also betrayed Bridget this same way. <em>Twice</em>. One of these times with Nick!</li><li> Taylor is a pro at this as well. She constantly bashes Brooke for her many romantic entanglements, especially for dating more than one man from the same family and for getting romantically involved with her daughter's love interests. Taylor herself has been engaged to Storm Logan, had a relationship with Stephen Logan and been romantically involved with Eric Forrester, Ridge Forrester, Thorne Forrester and Rick Forrester (the last of whom was her daughter Phoebe's great love and Phoebe's distress over this led to the car accident which Phoebe died). It coming to incredible degrees in which she fully blamed Bill for the affair that imploded Liam and Steffy's marriage, even after Steffy accepted and took the blame for her part with grace and maturity, even fostering a familial relationship between her and Hope, that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taylor attempted to gun down Bill in cold blood, almost even letting Ridge be persecuted of the crime.</span> Once again she evaded jail, after Steffy begged Bill to not implicate Taylor for the crime, once again she got back on her high horse condeming and calling Brooke, Hope and Bill horrible people, even as she made thinly veiled threats against the three.</li><li> Ridge also, who spent decades flip-flopping between Taylor and Brooke, yet went ballistic if either of them even looked at another man&mdash;he kicked Brooke to the curb over her kissing Grant and publicly humiliated her by publicly proposing to Taylor, and kicked Taylor to the curb over a one-night stand that happened over a decade ago and under duress.</li><li> The entire family is this when they refuse to attend Quinn and Eric's wedding, citing the many terrible things that Quinn has done&mdash;and conveniently forgetting the terrible things that <em>all of them</em> have done. Eric gives them an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> regarding this.</li><li> Brooke always hated it when Stephanie meddled in her relationship with Ridge, and has hated Taylor for years for stealing Ridge (more than once). The fact that Stephanie blatantly favored Taylor did <em>not</em> help matters. But Brooke meddling in Steffy's relationship with Liam, trying to push him towards her own daughter Hope, and at some points just straight-up refusing to give Steffy the benefit of the doubt in any given situation? <em>Totally</em> different.</li><li> Brooke is also quick to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">condemn</a> Steffy for sleeping with Bill, her husband's father, seeing it as a reason why her own daughter Hope should be with Liam instead. This is a bit rich when you remember that the only reason Hope <em>exists</em> is because Brooke had an affair with her <em>daughter's</em> husband.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>: Sally Spectra. Big, bold and larger than life, Sally was never afraid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">chew some scenery</a>.

Initially, she told him to marry Brooke because that was who she felt he belonged with, but her words keep getting retconned for storyline convenience. They can be either the former, or that she tells him to be with the woman who will make him happy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>: While not without drama or some genuinely sad or even scary moments, this show is, on the whole, <em>noticeably</em> more lighthearted than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless">its sister show</a>, with less serious storylines, more comedic moments, and its characters falling more on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">lighter end of the morality spectrum</a>. It's generally campier and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Melodrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Melodrama">melodramatic</a>, sometimes giving the impression that the writers and actors aren't taking this at <em>all</em> seriously, or have just decided to have as much fun as humanly possible with what they've been given.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">Malaproper</a>: In reflection of their rivalry, Caroline Spencer intentionally mispronounced Maya's name on various occasions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango">The Masochism Tango</a>: Stephanie and Eric, in spades. Stephanie does something to make Eric angry or otherwise make his life hell. He leaves her, finding comfort in the arms of a pretty young woman. Age difference aside, he seems genuinely happy with said woman as opposed to the constant bickering with Stephanie. Despite this, sooner or later, he is inevitably drawn back to Stephanie and they eventually reconcile, only for the whole thing to start all over again in just a matter of time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">May&#150;December Romance</a>: Quite a few.

She frequently butts in on the personal lives of her children, and if Brooke is in a relationship with any of them she'll do everything in her power to convince whichever son it is to give up on her. This has also extended to other Logan women, like Donna.<ul><li> In recent years, both Brooke and Ridge have become like this with their own children. And when Taylor thought <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thomas and Brooke had slept together</span> she entered Stephanie-territory with her rage at Brooke, screaming at her to stay away from Thomas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup">Minor Flaw, Major Breakup</a>: In 1994, Taylor had a one-night stand with a man named James both while she was separated from Ridge and while they were trapped together after an earthquake, believing that they would die any moment. This remains a secret until 2006, a year after Taylor comes back from the dead. Brooke finds out about the fling and after repeatedly throwing it in Taylor's face and almost blackmailing her with it, the truth is made known to Ridge. Ridge reacts to a fling Taylor had twelve years prior <em>while they weren't even together and occurring under extreme duress</em> as though she were committing adultery in the present and immediately dumps her with the intention of hooking back up with Brooke. His treatment of her becomes even more despicable when you recall that he cheated on her with Morgan &#150; in addition to <em>years</em> of ignoring Taylor's complaints about Brooke's constant interference. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>, much?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting">Monochrome Casting</a>: One of the most shameful examples ever, as the show is set in Los Angeles, yet in 25 years, the amount of minority characters can be counted on one hand. The show got better about this in 2015, with the expansions of existing African-American character Maya Avant's family (with younger sister Nicole as a regular, and parents Julius and Vivienne as recurrings) plus the return of Zende Forrester Dominguez, an orphan adopted from Africa by Kristen Forrester and her husband Tony Dominguez 13 years earlier, all of whom are joined by fellow existing black character Carter Walton.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNicknamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNicknamer">The Nicknamer</a>: Sally Spectra. She would usually give other characters at least one nickname, sometimes more. Clarke became Bucky, Darla became Einstein (and her daughter Alexandria later inherited that nickname), Massimo Marone became Mojo and Stephanie Forrester was usually called some variation of a royal title like The Queen Bee, Queen Stephanie, Highness, Queenie, and so on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>: Plenty of characters, but Sheila in particular. No matter what horrible things she did, she always blamed someone else&mdash;namely Stephanie&mdash;either for her actions or for whatever punishment she received.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>:<ul><li> The show entered <em>squicky</em> territory when it decided to pair Ridge and Bridget up together, shortly after it was discovered that they weren't half-brother and-sister, never mind that for years they had believed themselves to be, and that before that he had thought he was her <em>father</em>. Thankfully the storyline fizzled out before they went too far.</li><li> Similar reactions came from trying to pair half-siblings (kinda) Hope and Thomas up. Though Hope isn't related to Ridge by ancestry, she still calls him father and the whole thing raised the eye-brows of fans.</li><li> Also, the brief attempt to pair CJ, Macy's brother (they shared a mother), with Kimberley, Macy's sister (they shared a father). Even <em>CJ</em> had to keep reminding Kimberley that despite sharing a sister, they were not related.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Oedipus Complex</a>: Inverted, in what some psychologists have termed "The Jocasta Complex". Stephanie was so obsessed with Ridge that several people outright suggested that she's in love with her own son. Even favorite daughter-in-law Taylor got fed up with it when she finally realized that the real reason Stephanie had always supported her over Brooke in the battle over Ridge is because Taylor reminded Stephanie so much of herself that she figured that since she herself couldn't sleep with Ridge, she'd settle for him being with someone just like her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>: Wyatt and Justin both qualify, though both are mostly loyal to Bill. Wyatt tries to stay out of the feuds that pop up around him, and is hilariously annoyed by everyone's constant drama, but he will jump in and take a stand if something <em>really</em> matters to him. Justin, meanwhile, is similarly annoyed by his boss' shenanigans, but tends to take a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Whatever, as long as I get paid</a>" approach.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>: Given that it's a half-hour soap, and therefore is less able to fit as many storylines in one episode as the hour-longs, this happens from time to time. Particularly notable is the show's two remaining original characters Eric (John McCook) and Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang), whose appearances began to decline in 2015, in favor of the younger characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicCoParenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicCoParenting">Platonic Co-Parenting</a>: One storyline has Hope proposing this to Thomas, so she can help raise his son Douglas. Thomas, having gone full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a> at this point and being fully willing to exploit Douglas to get what he wants, doesn't go for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor">Plot Tumor</a>: The Hope/Liam/Steffy triangle. Liam started out as a minor character, and has grown to the point where his love life has become the sole focus of every other character on the show for an entire year and counting (September 2012).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">Polyamory</a>: Discussed by Liam and Wyatt in a 2018 episode, when discussing Liam's eternal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with Hope and Steffy. Wyatt asks Liam, if it were a feasible option, would he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">choose both of them</a>? Liam denies wanting a "harem," but Wyatt makes a pretty good case for it, pointing out that he loves them both, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll">something more non-conventional</a> maybe wouldn't be such a bad idea.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">Prison Rape</a>: While in a mental hospital for her various crimes, Sheila gets beaten up by two other prisoners. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">unpleasant appearance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">demeanor</a>, plus the way Sheila acts afterwards&mdash;taking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst">Shower of Angst</a>&mdash;are clearly meant to imply that they sexually assaulted her as well. Even if not, the whole sequence still gives off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a> vibe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> with Bill's right-hand man, Justin. Justin does pretty awful things, but only because Bill pays him, and he even serves as a voice of reason from time to time. (Not that Bill <em>listens</em> to him, ever, but still.) That said, Justin <em>does</em> clearly care about Bill, and seems to genuinely regard him as a friend.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory">Rape as Backstory</a>: Recent years has revealed this about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stephanie</span>, which serves to more or less explain her neurotic behavior. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> complete with a very emotional scene where Eric and Stephanie confront her mother about the abuse she suffered.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">Rape as Drama</a>: Brooke is an unfortunate victim of this trope frequently. In the pilot episode she's assault by a group of men and rushes home with her clothes in tatters. She's raped by Andy Johnson after the latter was hired by Stephanie to seduce her. Ridge also unintentionally raped her when he had sex with her while she was drugged. To his credit he had no idea she was drugged and was horrified when he realized what he did.<dl><dd><ul><li> Whether or not he knew she was drugged, it doesn't change the fact that she made it clear that she wanted him to leave her house &#150; and he didn't.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> There are fans who also believe Nick raped Brooke when everyone believed Ridge was dead and had sex with her while she was in a vulnerable state.</li><li> Cousin Jessica is assaulted by a masked man. It is revealed later that her assailant was her ex-boyfriend Sly, enraged that she turned down his marriage proposal and deprived him of the chance to get his hands on her money.</li><li> Taylor is also attacked several times by a man who appears to have this intent towards her. She's able to fend him off in one instance and Ridge rescues her the second time.</li><li> Ridge's first wife Caroline was also raped.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>:<ul><li> The 1994 Los Angeles earthquake was written into the show's storyline.</li><li> The 2020 COVID-19 outbreak caused a several month filming break while the cast quarantined, leading to a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> when the show came back to air: Katie claims that they had to close up shop to build and organize a new warehouse.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>:<ul><li> The first time Eric pursued Taylor, she listed a <em>lot</em> of reasons it was a bad idea. . .and stuck with it, rather than a typical soap storyline of her throwing caution to the wind and embarking on a relationship with him anyway.</li><li> The 2019-2020 storylines have repeated many of the adultery/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> storylines the show has used before (a fact that many soap operas are guilty of, not just this one). Until this point, each repeat storyline was like the previous ones had never happened. Recently, characters are starting to call each other out for having this predictable behavior, specifically calling out the fact that they constantly show regret over their actions and then willingly repeat it over and over again, which is what would happen if people willingly put each other through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochismTango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochismTango">Masochism Tango</a> for 15-odd years straight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Storm pretty much dug his own grave when he shot Stephanie and didn't show any remorse for it. When he accidentally shot Katie &#150; his little sister who had a heart condition &#150; he was so overcome with grief that he committed suicide in order to donate his heart to her and save her life. His sacrifice paid off because the heart took in Katie.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandHottie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandHottie">Right-Hand Hottie</a>: Darla to Sally. Darla was <em>fiercely</em> loyal to both Sally and Macy to the extend that though she was generally a quiet woman she would stand up for them no matter what.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove">Second Love</a>: It's a tossup as to whether Brooke or Taylor is this to Ridge following the death of first love Caroline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a>: Brooke is the only one who knows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taylor shot and almost killed Bill Spencer - she willingly keeps the secret because she got to watch Taylor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg">getting on her knees and begging her to keep the secret</a>, and seeing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a> willingly debasing herself like that was enough for her</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">Series Continuity Error</a>: This frequently happens when characters are SORAS'd, but a glaring example of this is the Logan sisters childhood angst. In recent years they've claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> and that oldest brother Storm practically raised them. But earlier episodes clearly show the Logan family to be a happy and stable family unit.<ul><li> This also included Steffy and Phoebe. For many years these two were known as identical twin sisters, and were even played by identical twins during different SORAS periods. When MacKenzie Mauzy was cast as Phoebe though, the show didn't bring Steffy on until much later, with Jacqueline MacInnes Wood playing her. Neither actress looks alike.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease">Soap Opera Disease</a>: Carolina developed leukemia, and in a rare Soap instance her <em>character stays dead</em>. Recently, Stephanie was diagnosed with <em>stage four lung cancer</em>, and made a complete recovery (at least for a little while; the cancer returns to kill her in 2012).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome">Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome</a>: All of the children at one point or another. In fact, the show has had very few high school-aged characters over the course of its run (unusual for a modern-day soap), as even many of those that have been aged rapidly have been pushed to at least 18 to advance the Forrester Creations-centered storylines.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">This Is Unforgivable!</a>: Stephanie is on the receiving end of this, including: when she sabotaged Donna's debut at Forrester Creations, when she exposed Jackie's prostitute past in front of the media, and most prominently when she inadvertently caused Brooke's rape at Andy's hands.<ul><li> Taylor is also on the receiving end of this. Ridge gave her this treatment over her fling with James, and even Nick treated her this way when she spoke honestly at Brooke's custody trial, after she begged the other woman to not be called as a character witness on her behalf. Then again, anything Taylor remotely does that's similar to what a Logan woman does is treated with long-term contempt, while the Logan women usually get off scot-free.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TickleTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TickleTorture">Tickle Torture</a>: During a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/DHJ_aKoUltE">Black and White<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a> in one episode, Quinn imagined that she has Hope tied down to a chair in her loft, surrounded by large pictures of herself.

To get her to say it, Quinn tickled Hope&#146;s arms and neck with a feather wand as Hope twitched and protested. "I love you, Mama Quinn, and I want you to be a part of my family", Quinn instructed Hope to repeat. Hope, agonizing beneath the tickling wand until she could take no more, repeated the phrase back to Quinn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a>: The second generation of Spectras aren't <em>evil</em>, but Coco is the only one who's 100% committed to keeping things on the level. Though Sally is now trying to change that, and is trying her hand at being good, too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">Tyrant Takes the Helm</a>: Rick Forrester during his relatively short tenure as CEO of Forrester Creations.

It leads to a successful takeover by Ridge, Liam and Steffy (the latter of whom originally wouldn't go forth with the plan unless getting back together with Liam, who was dating Ivy at that time and wanted to take over the company to save her from Rick's tyranny, was part of the deal) to get rid of Rick.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a>: This is a soap, after all. Multiple characters have been put through this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDaWhiteWomenAt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDaWhiteWomenAt">Where Da White Women At?</a>:<ul><li> Amber and Raymond, though their's was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits">Friends with Benefits</a> situation.</li><li> Also Justin and Donna, as we learn when her long-lost son Marcus comes to town.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole">Who Murdered the Asshole?</a>: Well, who <em>attempted</em> to murder the asshole. At one point, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">someone shoots and almost kills Bill Spencer - while he does survive, he never saw the attacker, meaning no one knew who did it. It also didn't help that by the time he was shot, Liam, Wyatt, Justin, Steffy, Ridge, and all of Sally Spectra's team had motive to attempt to kill him. The evidence originally suggested Ridge, but it turns out to have been Taylor, who had previously been out of town and thus had been unsuspected</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosYourDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosYourDaddy">Who's Your Daddy?</a>: Brooke was so sure that Bridget was Ridge's child that she named the baby Bridget &#150; which is a combination of Brooke and Ridge's names.
