Chuck had his formerly bright future as a Stanford student derailed by his best friend and roommate, Bryce Larkin, who framed Chuck as a cheat and got him expelled &mdash; apparently to steal his girlfriend Jill. One day, Chuck receives a strange email from Bryce. When he opens it, a vast array of nebulous government secrets, called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">The Intersect</a>, gets downloaded into his unsuspecting brain, turning him into a walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientDatabase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientDatabase">Omniscient Database</a>.</p><p>The various government agencies who contributed to this cache of government secrets are none too happy to have them stuck in Chuck's head, particularly since Bryce destroyed the original database, and at the same time sent the whole thing to Chuck. The agencies dispatch two agents to deal with the hapless Mr. Bartowski: the super-sexy CIA agent Sarah Walker (Bryce's former partner and erstwhile lover), and the borderline psycho NSA man, John Casey. Fortunately for Chuck, the agencies decide that Chuck may be more useful to them alive than dead, and they allow him to keep his normal life (more or less) &mdash; with the addition of Sarah and Casey as guards/handlers/minders.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Chuck suffers from frequent flashes where he spots something or someone that seems innocuous at first, but the Intersect stuffed into his head <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySignificanceSenseIsTingling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySignificanceSenseIsTingling">identifies the object or person as very important.</a> Chuck and his minders must find a way to act on Chuck's information, all the while keeping Chuck's family and friends in the dark about his special abilities and new status as government agent/prisoner.

In fact when he challenged Bryce about the changed code, Bryce <em>specifically</em> told him he doesn't want to know. By the end of the third season he was <em>expecting</em> them.

Sarah's history between 1998 and the early 2000s is largely unknown, but somehow she managed to fit: graduating high school, (her father was arrested before graduation, as classmates teased her as "jailbird's daughter") attending Harvard, (according to the official site) serving on the CAT Squad beginning at an unknown date to 2003, her "Red Test" in 2005, partnering with Bryce from 2005 to when he apparently turned rogue, <em>and</em> being assigned a handler as her last mission before being sent after Chuck in 2007 (when the series premiered).

Quite moving, considering both of them had been on the verge of crying only moments before. In detail: Chuck has been convinced that Sarah's feelings for him will get one or both of them killed, and so lies through his teeth, telling Sarah that he wants someone normal and that she can "never be normal". Chuck is not liking to have to be saying this, and Sarah is... well, she's just been told that Chuck, the first person she has ever loved, doesn't want to be with her because she is a spy. She's crushed. And then the two of them look at each other sadly, and then put on really sincere-looking grins as they prepare to spend the night pretending to be a couple and discussing Ellie and Devon's upcoming wedding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperheroDayJobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperheroDayJobs">Stock Superhero Day Jobs</a>:<ul><li> Actually quite an original one &mdash; as a computer techie, Chuck's got a 9&mdash;5 job that he can easily drop at a moment&#146;s notice just by claiming he's "on an install".</li><li> How Casey the floor-sales guy gets away with the same thing is... <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

However, it's somewhat explained that everyone is too afraid of Casey to ask. Also considering how insane the other employees can be, someone no-nonsense like Casey would be a valuable employee no matter how absent he seems to be. The Buy-More can't be too picky considering the employee pool available to them. Furthermore, Chuck's the Nerd Herd supervisor, not to mention the store's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>, meaning people tend to notice when he goes missing. Casey's a rank-and-file greenshirt, meaning no one probably cares what he does during the day, as long as he clocks in and out.

In season 2 and earlier he was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">Action Survivor</a> or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a> at best. At the end of season 2 he gains the Intersect 2.0, which gives him access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">a vast library of useful skills in addition to the knowledge that came standard with the Intersect</a>. It took him most of season three to learn to use that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">reliably</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySkullRunnethOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySkullRunnethOver">safely</a>. Along the way he was given lots of field assignments that put him in harm's way and forced him to make tough choices. By the start of season four he's beating up a dozen guards at a time. After losing the Intersect yet again in season 5 it is revealed that Chuck has learned enough to defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daniel Shaw, also without an Intersect</span> in single combat. Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shaw</span> was a highly-trained government agent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even without the Intersect</span>, the fact that Chuck can beat him without the Intersect shows how much he's learned.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morgan</span> is still not a fighter or even particularly clever, but Casey has complimented him on his bravery more than once.

When he found out that Bryce got him kicked out of Stanford to protect him, he said that he wished he could talk to him, and the whole episode ended on a nostalgic note. But after Bryce returned, Chuck was constantly jealous of him, even though they used to be best friends, and once said something about Bryce ruining his life, seemingly forgetting about everything Bryce had done <em>for</em> him. Though to be fair, whatever Bryce's best intentions, being kicked out of Stanford <em>did</em> seriously derail Chuck's future prospects. An expulsion for cheating from a prestigious university on one's permanent academic record will make it much more difficult for Chuck to get admitted anywhere else, and will not be viewed favorably by a prospective employer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>:<ul><li> Team Bartowski, extending to Morgan, Ellie and Awesome; especially after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they all become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keepers</a></span>.</li><li> The Buy More staff.

Chuck eventually dumps Lou to be with Sarah, only to discover that her former lover Bryce is still alive. Later on Chuck gets back together with his old girlfriend Jill and Sarah gets jealous.
