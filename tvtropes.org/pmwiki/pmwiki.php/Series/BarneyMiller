The episodes tended to take place entirely within the bleak, ancient squad room of the (fictional) 12th Precinct in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCityCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCityCops">New York City</a>'s Greenwich Village, as the detectives booked and processed various suspects. Action sequences usually took place off-camera and were described by the detectives as they returned from the scene. What made the show worth watching was <a class="urllink" href="http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/10/barney-miller-inside-look.html">the razor-sharp writing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and the eccentric personalities of the detectives, including:</p><p></p><ul><li> The eponymous Captain Miller (Hal Linden), whose underlings exasperate him and whose superiors ignore him; an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> who often feels ineffectual and underappreciated. Best known for leaving suspects and victims together for a while in hopes that they will work things out without pressing charges (and therefore without the associated paperwork).</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Detective Nick Yemana (Jack Soo), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekick</a> of the squadroom. He takes a laissez-faire attitude to most things and often makes inappropriate jokes. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadToTheLastDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadToTheLastDrop">bad coffee</a> is legendary. Yemana was among the first regular adult characters on U.S. prime-time television written specifically for an American of Japanese descent.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0w3us');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0w3us" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0w3us');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> Sulu was played by Japanese American George Takei, but the character's nationality was deliberately left unspecified.</span> The character left the show in Season 5 when Jack Soo fell ill and died of cancer.</li><li> Sergeant Philip K. Fish (Abe Vigoda), an elderly and dyspeptic complainer who alternately wisecracks about today's batch of criminals or his wife. Despite his endless moaning, he can't stand the thought of his impending retirement. The character began appearing in a spin-off series, <em>Fish</em>, midway through the third season but didn't leave until the end of it (getting a proper send-off in the fourth season premiere). The spin-off didn't last two years, and Fish continued to return for occasional appearances on the parent show.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Detective Stanley Thaddeus "Wojo" Wojciehowicz<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1tics');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1tics" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1tics');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"You say it like it's spelled!" or "Spelled just like it sounds!"</span> (Max Gail), who tended to act entirely on his impulses, causing Barney endless headaches. His original uncouth and dense character gradually became more enlightened as the series went on.</li><li> Sergeant Ron Nathan Harris (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonGlass">Ron Glass</a>), whose police work frequently took second place to his novel-writing. He had a diva-esque attitude, best exemplified by his reluctance to wear anything he considered unstylish, even during undercover work. He also considered himself the squadroom intellectual, at least until the arrival of...</li><li> Detective Arthur Dietrich (Steve Landesberg), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> and card-carrying intellectual, whose long-winded speculations about criminal psychology, science, and just about anything else that happened to come up in conversation drove the other detectives crazy. He particularly annoyed Harris, who didn't appreciate having a rival for being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">the Smart One</a>". He debuted in Season 2, became a regular in season 3 after Fish's retirement, and stuck around through the end of the run.</li><li> Officer Carl Levitt (Ron Carey), a uniformed officer stationed downstairs. Levitt spent years incessantly pestering Captain Miller about promoting him to detective, combining obsequious servility with snarky sarcasm when his requests were rejected. Became a regular along with Dietrich in Season 3 and stuck around for the rest of the run.</li><li> During the first two seasons, Sergeant Chano Amenguale (Gregory Sierra); an amiable, talkative guy, but basically deficient in outstanding personality quirks. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">disappeared</a> when Sierra got a lead role on another sitcom, which promptly crashed and burned, beating <em>Fish</em> to the punch by a season.</li><li> Barney's immediate superior Inspector Franklin D. Luger (James Gregory), who does nothing but chew Barney's ear all day, get Barney to do his paperwork for him, and long for the halcyon days of acceptable police brutality.</li><li> In the first season, which had episodes alternating between the squadroom and Barney's home life, Barbara Barrie was a regular as Barney's wife Elizabeth; as the former setting proved more compelling, Liz was subsequently shifted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> and eventually moved offscreen, save for a couple of guest appearances.</li></ul><p>Throughout the run, the show tried adding new characters to the cast; most of them would be given a "test run" of about three episodes to make an impression. More than half a dozen cops were "auditioned" this way. Save for Dietrich, none of them really worked, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>. (Linda Lavin probably would have stayed on too, if she hadn't been offered the lead role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alice1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alice1976">Alice (1976)</a></em>; she appeared promiently in flashbacks despite being in only five episodes). Midway through the fifth season, actor Jack Soo (Yemana) died. The cast did a memorial episode out-of-character for Soo, but Yemana was never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">killed off</a> in so many words. Once in a while, he would be mentioned in the past tense, sometimes with an air of wistfulness. When Levitt worked in the detective squad room, he took over Yemana's desk.</p><p>This show is also remembered for its super-catchy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstrumentalThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstrumentalThemeTune">Instrumental Theme Tune</a>, which has quite possibly the most famous bass line in TV history.</p><p>Characters and references to the show still turn up. In a novel spinoff of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em>, <em>Confessions of Rustin Parr</em>, the investigations were headed by Detective Nicholas Yemana. In William P. Young's supernatural murder mystery <em>The Shack</em>, a Polish police detective says his name is "spelled just like it sounds". In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, one of Martin's police friends was Stan Wojciedubakowski, and when he died, Martin briefly dated his widow.

Dennis Farina, who really worked as a policeman before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue">becoming an actor</a>, says it's the most realistic. In 2014, it was called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ibtimes.com/barney-miller-forty-years-later-most-intelligent-literate-us-sitcom-ever-1556406">the most intelligent and literate U.S. sitcom ever made.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The detectives were made honorary members of the NYPD.

At day's end, each of the detectives says "Good night, <em>Inspector</em>" and Luger responds with his usual nicknames, Har', D.D., etc. Then Levitt: "Good night, Inspector Luger." "Good night, Levitt." Levitt, quietly: "Thank you, sir."</li><li> And in the series finale, when Luger visits the guys before the precinct closes, he calls Levitt "Levine" again.

Chano and Fish are dispatched to a bank robbery and, during a shootout, Chano kills two suspects to avert a deadly hostage situation. Unlike the world-weary Fish, who &mdash; it is implied &mdash; has used deadly force several times in the past, the relatively inexperienced Chano is unnerved and shaken by the experience. The trope kicks in toward the end of the episode: Having turned on the news to hear each of the local stations lead off with the bank robbery and cop-on-suspect shootings, and after Barney stops by briefly to check in on him, Chano is alone in his dingy apartment, he breaks down in deep sobs ... the realization that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">he is no hero</a> (or doesn't feel like one) and that his best attempts to avert a deadly situation failed.

Levitt protested its removal because without it he had less chance of getting his occasional assignments to work with the detectives, proving himself worthy of promotion.

Nick disappeared from the series and was definitely gone for good; there was an episode where a lot of drama was attached to the removal of his desk from the office, and characters would sometimes mention "back when Nick was here". However, it was never made clear whether he died or just went away somewhere. Season 5's "Jack Soo: A Retrospective" where the cast remembers Soo, who had died of esophageal cancer, and the series' final episode cleared this up. Looking around the squadroom one last time, Barney remembers (via flashback clips) the cops who'd left the squad in years past. When he remembers Chano, Wentworth and Fish, Barney is smiling in fond remembrance. When he remembers Nick, though, his expression is very sad. Clearly, Nick had passed on.<ul><li> Jack Soo had esophageal cancer. Linden visited Soo in the hospital just before he was to have surgery.

The debate is ended when the wife agrees to drop charges after the husband promises to be nicer to her and more affectionate.

Additionally, both Barney and Levitt get long sought-after promotions, to deputy inspector and plainclothes detective respectively. Luger gets married. An array of recurring characters (Bruno Binder and his wife, Marty and Darryl, Ray Brewer, others) turn up to wish the detectives farewell. The show ends with Barney, alone in the office, looking around and wistfully remembering Chano, Fish, Wentworth, and Yemana, before leaving.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical">Stop Being Stereotypical</a>:<ul><li> In the first episode Puerto Rican officer Chano rants at a Puerto Rican criminal for being so embarrassed when catching his fellow Puerto Ricans committing crimes that Chano has to arrest them in an exaggerated white-guy accent.</li><li> Harris is very irritated at a Jamaican doctor who claims to be under a curse from a voodoo priestess.

This is plot-relevant, as Mr. Driscoll is trying to get the 12th to make his homophobic ex-wife honor his child visitation rights with their son.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a>: Barney, inevitably to whatever zaniness was going on around him. Nowhere more prominent than in "Hash", where he's the only one who didn't eat one of the hash brownies. In the DVD commentary the writers say that Barney was given jokes on occasion early on, but it became clear that the humor was more effective with Barney as a straight man for all the wacky visitors to bounce off of.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudioAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudioAudience">Studio Audience</a>: Used for the first three seasons, before being discarded in favor of a closed set and a (very sparsely employed) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack">Laugh Track</a>.<ul><li> At times during the three-part final episode, the chuckles of the crew can be heard faintly in the background.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks">Stupid Crooks</a>: <em>Dozens</em>, and way too many to list. Among those that stand out: A flasher who is arrested in the middle of December when it's below zero (he later cleans up his act and becomes a councilor in a later season), a man in a wheelchair who shoplifts <em>and</em> twice tries to flee the station ("Wojo's Problem"), and a convict who is given unsupervised prison furloughs for work release, but uses them to commit armed robberies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion">Subverted Rhyme Every Occasion</a>: In "Vanished" Part 2 the detectives arrest one Alfred Royce, a kook who committed armed robbery in order to fund his campaign for the Presidency in 1980. Barney reads his bumper sticker: "Alfred Royce, the people's...candidate."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweepingTheTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweepingTheTable">Sweeping the Table</a>: When Yemana has acute appendicitis they need to lay him down on a flat surface until the paramedics arrive, so Wojo picks up one side of his own desk, dumping the stuff on the floor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThisJobAndShoveIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThisJobAndShoveIt">Take This Job and Shove It</a>: In series finale "Landmark" part 3, Harris reacts to the news that he is being transferred to Queens by shouting "I quit!".

He doesn't want to shoot it, and he certainly doesn't want to be attacked, and the owner is demanding to be set free in exchange for calling it off. So Nick picks up the keys, very slowly walks over to the cage... and locks himself in there next to the owner.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: In "Hair", Det. Gardeno, a temporary transfer to the 12th Precinct, takes a bullet for Chano. Subverted when a shamefaced Gardeno admits to Barney that it was an accident; he knocked down Chano not to take the bullet for him, but because he was turning to run away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingDownTheSuicidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingDownTheSuicidal">Talking Down the Suicidal</a>: A semi-regular occurence; the squad will get a call about a jumper and then return with the would-be suicide.

It's the audience rather than the characters, but the joke is still a tension-breaker. After the sobering account of the Birkenau concentration camp in which Mr. Baru was the only survivor from thousands of Roma, and the inability to jail Zelinka, the ex-Nazi, Baru has to make one confession to the squad:<div class="indent"> "I have over <em>three hundred</em> parking tickets."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThankingTheViewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThankingTheViewer">Thanking the Viewer</a>: After the final freeze frame of the final episode, the credit "Goodbye and thank you from all of us at the old One-Two" pops up on the screen before the credits roll.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksgivingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksgivingEpisode">Thanksgiving Episode</a>: "Thanksgiving Story", in which a man is brought into the precinct for stabbing his brother-in-law with a fork over Thanksgiving dinner.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality">This Is Reality</a>: One criminal copycats heists from shows and TV movies.

As is typical of this low-key cop show, it's because Barney was trying to avoid an ugly confrontation. He is relieved of duty after dragging his feet about enforcing a court order to eject some renters from their soon-to-be-demolished apartment building.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled">Uncanceled</a>: The pilot was originally not picked up, and just "burned off" in the summer. However the ratings of that one showing revived interest in the concept, and more episodes were ordered the next season.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncoffee">Uncoffee</a>: Wojo tries to come up with a coffee substitute during a drought and uses Dietrich's idea of hot Dr. Pepper.

The character's reaction to learning who Dietrich is strongly implies he's a household name in the future.
