The show is produced by Epitome Pictures and aired in Canada by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CTV">CTV</a> (2001-09), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianMultichannelNetworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianMultichannelNetworks">MuchMusic</a> (2010-2013), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV Canada</a> (2013-2015). In the U.S, it was broadcast on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noggin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noggin">Noggin</a>'s nighttime teen block, The N, beginning in 2002. It was carried over to the successor channel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeenNick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeenNick">TeenNick</a> in 2009.</p><p>This show is very much like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a>, with constantly shifting relationships and angst, but can be as serious as a regular television drama. On the negative side, the show is as melodramatic as adult soaps. There are times when it feels like one giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> stretched out into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> (except that the very special problem isn't resolved in twenty minutes). In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment">very first episode</a></em>, Emma Nelson, the quasi-protagonist (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiJuniorHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiJuniorHigh">Spike's daughter</a>) narrowly avoids getting raped by a pedophile she met online. However, on the plus side, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> format lets it go much deeper and more long-term than the average show about teens (no solving problems in twenty minutes, and most of the kids have gone through real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This show is notable for a few reasons. The show, like in it's 1980s iteration, is one of the few exceptions to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a>; the teenage characters are almost all played by actual teenagers, and they're very good actors, lately coming to the series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySoManyCanadianActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySoManyCanadianActors">years of experience in other TV productions, often alongside each other</a>. And despite the famed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious-ness</a> of the show, some of the lessons taught by the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">are</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">really</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">important for the teenage audience</a>. The show is usually cited as one of the few "earnest" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenDrama">Teen Dramas</a> and the show has won a Peabody in 2011 for the portrayal of Adam, the first regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> character in the history of teen television. It's also one of the few teen dramas to be nominated for an Emmy two years in a row (in 2011 and 2012). It also has a very teenage morality.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>After 14 seasons, <em>The Next Generation</em> was cancelled by Nickelodeon/TeenNick. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DHXMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DHXMedia">DHX Media</a> (known as Wildbrain as of 2019) bought Epitome, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamilyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamilyChannel">Family Channel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> launched a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">direct sequel</a> (that functions more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftReboot">Soft Reboot</a>), <em>Degrassi: Next Class</em>, in 2016. <em>Next Class</em> starred many of the newer characters introduced through seasons 11-14 of <em>The Next Generation</em>, making it the first series where no main character had a link with either the 1980s cast or the original <em>Next Gen</em> cast. Eventually, two years after the fourth season finale, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/KaryDegrassi/status/1035718720851730432">Stefan Brogen confirmed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the show was canceled. Though Netflix never officially cancelled the series and Wildbrain has stated they're committed to the Degrassi franchise, one thing is certain: <em>this</em> series, <em>Degrassi: The Next Generation</em> is over after being on the air for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">seventeen years</a></em>.</p><p><em>The Next Generation</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition">also known for</a> being the show rapper/singer Aubrey "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake">Drake</a>" Graham was once a cast member of. He refused to acknowledge this until he hosted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> in early 2014, and has since embraced this, even <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIhx2wZ8jnA">putting together a mini-Degrassi reunion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the "I'm Upset" music video.</p><p>As of 2019, seasons 1-13 (sans season 12 finale movie &#147;It&#146;s the End of the World as We Know It/The Time of Your Life&#148;) are airing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlutoTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlutoTV">Pluto TV</a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5KDzT0_pxIDdU8RPLhMuHg">all episodes seasons 1-14 have been uploaded<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tubi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tubi">Tubi</a>. <em>Degrassi: Next Class</em> can still be seen on Netflix.</p><hr><h2>This show provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-B&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">A Date with Rosie Palms</a>: Finally explored for the first time in <em>Next Class</em> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lola using her showerhead to masturbate.

Subverted when Sean introduces her to Trey "Towerz" Hightower, who does not consider her abhorrent at all.</li><li> When Connor expresses interest in Clare, she sees him this way, especially after he becomes violent towards Alli and poorly handles her rejection.</li><li> Love Queen 16, Connor's online friend, exaggerates about her age and good looks on the internet.</li><li> Arguably, Imogen starts off as this towards Eli, who wants nothing to do with any woman besides Clare. By the beginning of season eleven, Eli has a change of heart and sees her as a legitimate romantic option.</li><li> Played with in the Season 2 "When Doves Cry" episodes. JT wants to date Paige; her friends pay her to go out with him, then they end up having a good date. JT finds out she was paid. They work it out, and she tells him she only "dates up."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: The whole plot with Clare interning at the Toronto Interpreter and getting sexually assaulted by her boss, Asher, was completely dropped from the rest of the twelfth season and never brought up again. The only closure was that she and another accuser are going to the police.<ul><li> After being dumped for Jenna, Clare makes a declaration that she's going to win KC back setting up a rivalry with Jenna. Clare never makes any attempt to win KC back and the storyline is largely forgotten after the introduction of Eli as Clare's new love interest.</li><li> At the end of Season 12, Zig and Maya seem to finally be on the road to starting a relationship after getting passed the love quadrangle drama with Tori and Cam. Fast forward to Season 13 and Zig is gone and is replaced by Miles (Zig would return later in the season but only to bemoan the fact that Maya is still choosing other guys over him).</li><li> Another one often referenced is from the Season 7 episode "Talking in Your Sleep". Paige ends up sleeping with Griffin. Later she finds out he has HIV. She gets tested and is told by doctors that she won't know the results for 6 months. Griffin unceremoniously disappears from the show shortly after this revelation when Paige reveals she is moving out, and there is never any follow-up on Paige's results. Actress Lauren Collins who played Paige has referenced this plothole jokingly a few times on her Twitter.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ypca');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ypca" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ypca');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Griffin was on several HIV drugs as said on the show, all meant to decrease HIV infection (though they don't stop HIV transmission, and this was several years before the breakthrough of pre-exposure prophylaxis or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrEP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrEP">Pr EP</a> which greatly reduces the risk of transmission).

She ignores Ellie, leaving her to fend for herself, and is emotionally abusive on the rare occasion when she is actually awake.

She is hugely dependent on Miles and fakes a suicide attempt when she thinks he's slipping away. Plus, the prescription pills were hers so she's clearly been diagnosed with something. Later we discover that at least part of it is PTSD and abandonment issues from being the one to find her mother's body after she committed suicide. She gets triggered again very badly when she and Zig find Maya's body after her attempted suicide and spins out of control all through the next season, exhibiting extra jealous behaviour over Maya and Zig's relationship and going out of her way to keep Zig by trying to incorporate Frankie in a threesome in order to keep him happy and also keep Frankie for herself as well, by helping distance her from her own friends. She ultimately enters a psychotic state in the last few episodes of season 4 and accidentally hurts Zig in a fit, and brings a motorcycle to school and begs him to run away with her. The fact that no adults have shown any concern for her up to that point and Zig's not-quite-delicate handling make this an egregious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a></span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity">Ambiguous Gender Identity</a>: Yael, who is the first non-binary character in Degrassi history.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish">Ambiguously Jewish</a>:<ul><li> Inverted by Shane Kippel <em>in real life</em>!

In season 11 she's much more well-rounded and really only kept the loneliness part of her season 9 quirk. As a matter of fact, Fiona and Declan seemingly switched personalities mid-season. When first introduced, Fiona was the friendly new girl and Declan was the arrogant bad boy. Mid-season Declan had somehow become socially popular and Fiona had somehow become a stuck-up bitch.</li><li> It's a bit jarring that Shay sent nudes for money, bullied Arlene for being geeky, and made a move on a taken man compared to her characterization in Next Class, where she is the nerdiest girl aside from Yael, and very shy about boys and sex.</li><li> Tiny is much more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> in Next Class compared to his characterization in TNG.</li><li> Grace looses her savvy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Trickster Mentor</a> persona in Next Class, appearing much more withdrawn and passive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a>: This happens quite a bit with Mia during Season 8, much to Holly J's (and many fans') annoyance.

They make up pretty quickly after this, but their bigger fight comes later that season in "Against All Odds" when Emma doesn't approve of Manny helping Craig cheat on Ashley. They don't talk to each other for what appears to be several months in-universe. Things between the two are finally patched up when Emma helps Manny out with her pregnancy.
