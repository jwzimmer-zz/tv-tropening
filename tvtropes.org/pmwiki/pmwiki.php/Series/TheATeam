The most notable is the season 4 finale, involving their pursuer General Fullbright enlisting their help to go back to Vietnam to find his illegitimate daughter. The humor of the show is replaced by a somber mood, as the team reflects on their experiences in Vietnam.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>:<ul><li> In an episode with a science fiction con, a guy in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">original Galactica Cylon suit</a> walks past "Face". In the episode in question, it's actually Hannibal in the costume. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a> was all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DirkBenedict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DirkBenedict">Dirk Benedict</a>'s idea. While filming at Universal Studios for the second season episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS2E11Steel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS2E11Steel">Steel</a>", Dirk spotted a park employee dressed as a Cylon, and decided he wanted to film a little nod to his days as Starbuck. The director told him it was a dumb idea, but let him do it anyway. So, they had the Cylon-clad actor stroll nonchalantly across the frame while Face was all "don't I know you?" Fortunately for Dirk, the scene ended up being quite funny and they kept it in the credits up to season 5.</li><li> There were also allusions to George Peppard and his previous roles:<ul><li> Hannibal's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan">off-kilter words of wisdom</a> in episodes such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS3E15TheBigSqueeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS3E15TheBigSqueeze">The Big Squeeze</a>" seem like exaggerations of similar quotes he said as Thomas Banacek in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Banacek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Banacek">Banacek</a></em>.</li><li> In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS1E7TheRabbitWhoAteLasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS1E7TheRabbitWhoAteLasVegas">The Rabbit Who Ate Las Vegas</a>", Amy mentions that it's a shame Hannibal's being chased by the military as he is "a terrific actor" after Hannibal goes to great lengths explaining how he'll play his "character", a reference to Peppard's infamously stringent adherence to method acting, even when playing unchallenging roles.</li></ul></li><li> The entire fifth season episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS5E6TheSayUNCLEAffair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS5E6TheSayUNCLEAffair">The Say U.N.C.L.E.

Near the beginning of the episode, the team crashes thanks to Murdock having stolen their plane off a repair lot. Some of them, especially B.A., are not at all happy about this. Then, near the end of the episode, the team narrowly escapes Col. Lynch and realizes that, had they not crashed, they would have been right on time to fall into his trap.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockingMacGyverInTheStoreCupboard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockingMacGyverInTheStoreCupboard">Locking MacGyver in the Store Cupboard</a>: The A-Team tends to get locked in barns or garages full of machinery and explosive things.<ul><li> Lampshaded in one episode by Hannibal.<div class="indent"> <strong>Hannibal:</strong> <em>(after a giant truck of destruction has burst out of a shed)</em> Where, exactly, did you lock up my team?</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Bad Guy:</strong> In the old equipment shed.</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Hannibal:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">What an original idea.

Decker talks about how having one man wounded will make the A-Team's ability crumble as they try to save their injured member. He's right that it hampers them, but it doesn't stop them. Given that the "virtue" in question is loyalty to their injured friend, it overlaps with a platonic version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsAWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsAWeakness">Love Is a Weakness</a>.<div class="indent"><strong>Colonel Decker:</strong> [The A-Team] think as one, feel as one, and act as one.

Murdock sometimes takes a break from being a pest in B.A.'s general direction to insult B.A. B.A. actually complains about being saved from a life-threatening injury because getting Murdock's blood might make him like Murdock; Murdock encourages these fears after giving the blood. However, it's clear that they care about each other quite a lot. B.A. really worries about Murdock when Murdock is in trouble, and Murdock really does try well-meaningly to help B.A. learn to deal with airplanes, among other instances of sincerely meant aid. There is even one episode where the B.A./Murdock dynamic seems to flip, so that Murdock is giving B.A. much more grief than he's getting. B.A. also told off at least one person outside the A-Team who complained that Murdock should shut up, and it was nicely done.<div class="indent"><strong>Murdock</strong> <em>(while B.

A.'s fear of flying. He ended up giving one exception in one of the later episodes, when he learned that his mother was attacked by thugs; even then, he still had to be sedated within several minutes of flying. In another episode, he decides the cause (getting them pardoned) is enough to go on a plane; he still ends up passing out, but it's ambiguous whether they drugged him anyway, or whether he just went comatose (which happened on an early episode where he ended up on a plane).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma">Wire Dilemma</a>: Played straight in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS4E4LeaseWithAnOptionToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS4E4LeaseWithAnOptionToDie">Lease with an Option to Die</a>". Near the end, Plout's men attach a bomb to the apartment building's boiler.
