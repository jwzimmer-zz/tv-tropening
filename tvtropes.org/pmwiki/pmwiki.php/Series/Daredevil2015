It introduces two major characters from Marvel lore: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">Frank Castle</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonBernthal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonBernthal">Jon Bernthal</a>), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elektra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elektra">Elektra Natchios</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElodieYung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElodieYung">&Eacute;lodie Yung</a>). The near-unanimous praise for Bernthal's performance as Castle led to him getting his own spinoff show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePunisher2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePunisher2017">The Punisher</a></em>, released on November 17, 2017.</p><p>A third season of <em>Daredevil</em> was released on October 19, 2018, and introduces several more characters of Daredevil lore, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilsonBethel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilsonBethel">Wilson Bethel</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BullseyeMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BullseyeMarvelComics">Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter</a>, Joanne Whalley as Sister Maggie, and Jay Ali as Ray Nadeem.

Things get complicated when a rookie police officer stumbles upon them and Matt is forced to overpower him, leading to a hostage situation drawing in the various crooked cops Matt was trying to avoid.</li><li> For the duration of Season 1, Fisk has meetings with other associates in a warehouse by the docks.</li><li> The Season 2 finale sees Karen and a bunch of other Daredevil survivors get held hostage by the Hand in one of these.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>:<ul><li> Fisk mentions the hammer he used to kill his father was saved by his mother. Then Karen also brings him killing his father as a possible case against him. But this Chekhov's Hammer hasn't hit.</li><li> Early in Season 3, Matt believes the key to defeating Fisk is finding out why he snitched on the Albanians specifically. During the investigation he finds another lead and doesn't look into Fisk's snitching rationale again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Matt was right to be suspicious of Fisk's target</a>, but it plays into his long-term goals, not anything that can immediately be used against him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>:<ul><li> In the comics, Gladiator is a career criminal and supervillain, albeit one who attempts to mend his ways. In the show, Melvin Potter is a somewhat innocent idiot-savant who is forced to serve Fisk to protect his girlfriend, and then turns to being Matt's fulltime armorer once Fisk is arrested. Even his return to working for Fisk is against his will.</li><li> Karen's father was a supervillain named Death's Head in the comics, but here, he's just a diner owner who doesn't know how to be fiscally responsible with his cash.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">Adaptation Dye-Job</a>:<ul><li> Matt has red hair in the comics, with his fiery coloration being an intentional artistic play on the devil motif. This would look incredibly silly on Charlie Cox, so he just sports his natural brown hair color with a bit of copper-red tinting.</li><li> Wilson Fisk normally wears white suits in the comics. Here, he wears black in his earliest incarnation to show his transformation to his full Kingpin persona. When he takes his relationship with Vanessa to the next level, he begins to wear lighter shades. In Season 3, Fisk is seen primarily in white suits, having completely become the Kingpin.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>:<ul><li> The <em>Daily Bugle</em>, Ben Urich's employer in the comics, is renamed the <em>New York Bulletin</em>, due to Spider-Man not being rolled into the MCU until after that season was produced. This also includes Urich's boss, J. Jonah Jameson, who was replaced with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a> Mitchell Ellison.</li><li> In the comics, Frank Castle's family was killed by thugs working for the Costas, an Italian mob family.

Ellison repeatedly points out that print is dying and how the news is becoming more about clickbait than useful information. Right up until Ben's last words, in fact. Come Season 2, Ellison, feeling guilty over not having backed Ben's investigation, has a big change of heart, and backs Karen's investigation into Frank Castle's family the whole way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>:<ul><li> Although he's supposed to be blind, Matt's eyes look perfectly normal and show no sign of discoloration.

That would be impossible as 12th Avenue at Hell's Kitchen is the West Side Highway, as opposed to a regular street. On the opposite side of the street from the buildings should be the USS Intrepid Museum, which is not visible in any shots. The West Side Highway is also eight lanes at this point, not a two lane road with buildings on both sides.

Vermont Route 12 is a north-south highway that runs parallel to Interstate 89 for much of its length, with the two highways only crossing at the state capital in Montpelier. There's also no direct off-ramp between VT-12 and I-89. There also is no Windler County in Vermont, as Montpelier is in Washington County.</li><li> Early in "Into the Ring," we see Foggy meet with Brett as Brett emerges from what is supposedly the 50th Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line. The entrance signage on the stairwell is accurate, but the landscape of the surrounding buildings isn't. The area around 50th Street and Eighth Avenue in the show is depicted as lowrises that don't exceed five stories at most. In reality, this area is primarily composed of highrises exceeding 20 stories. The scene itself was actually shot at Bedford Avenue on the BMT Canarsie Line.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>:<ul><li> After his father's death, young Matt is shown to be living in an orphanage.

Or so it seems. Fisk and Madame Gao can also understand and speak all four, and Nobu knows English as well, but all keep it a secret.

Matt, Karen and Foggy succeed in bringing down Fisk's operations within the law, and Daredevil stops Fisk when he makes a run for it. However, a lot of people suffered and died along the way, including Mrs. Cardenas and Ben Urich. Also, Karen killed Wesley, and Fisk will have her killed if he ever finds out. Further, the most powerful of Fisk's partners, such his allies within The Hand (Madame Gao and Nobu), are still out there.</li><li> Season 2 is even starker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nobu is killed again and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationRequired">he won't be coming back this time</a>, while Frank has exacted his revenge on the Blacksmith. <em>However</em>...(deep breath) Frank was released from prison with Fisk's help, and he knows his crusade against organized crime will only serve to help Fisk regain control of his criminal empire once he's out of prison. Matt and Elektra rekindled their relationship only for her to die saving him and then her body is taken by the Hand, a fate she was trying to avoid in the first place. Nelson &amp; Murdock dissolve in both business and friendship, and while Karen goes on to become a reporter for <em>The New York Bulletin</em> and Foggy takes a lucrative position at Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz, Matt is left with only Karen, out of a job, and facing a dark future as his enemies are growing in power. So for him it's a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, though that's mitigated by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em> which show that Matt is doing very good running a solo law practice out of his apartment and he is still on amicable (albeit awkward) speaking terms with Karen and Foggy.</span></li><li> Season 3 has the most unambiguously happy ending, but even it isn't immune to this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fisk is in prison, seemingly for good this time as Matt has leverage to ensure his scheming days are over. Matt, Foggy, and Karen have reconnected as friends and plan to re-open Nelson and Murdock as Nelson, Murdock, and Page, with Karen as a professional private investigator. Matt has cleared Daredevil's name by handing the police Dex in a Daredevil suit with a broken back (courtesy of Fisk) as Matt in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaOutfit">Beta Outfit</a> walks off the scene. Matt's reconnected with his mother, a nun, who will provide the guidance and wisdom Matt used to rely on Father Lantom for. And finally, Daredevil, in his black starter outfit, is seen once more standing watch over Hell's Kitchen. But. . . Father Lantom is dead at Dex's hands. A chunk of the FBI has been arrested for collusion with Wilson Fisk, adding to the general corruption at all levels of government in the MCU. Fisk's rise to power involved creating a deliberate power vacuum that he could slip into, and that vacuum is again vacant, and we saw how that turned out in Season 2. Melvin Potter has been arrested for violating parole in working with Fisk again and trying to frame Matt as "murderous Dex" Daredevil, so it's unlikely Matt will be getting a new costume anytime soon (and even if he did, there may be lingering resentment against that particular suit). Finally, Dex is undergoing experimental surgery to repair his broken back, and as the doctors debate whether it'll work at all, Dex's eyes flare open and we see a Bullseye reflected in them, indicating Daredevil hasn't seen that last of his greatest foe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Oh, and Netflix cancelled the show, so whatever continuation Daredevil's story will have will be in a different format.</a></span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>:<ul><li> The show dramatizes the ethical dilemma of Matt Murdock, a lawyer sworn to uphold the law, who is routinely breaking it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">vigilante</a>.</li><li> Matt also fights a second ethical dilemma under this same trope.

Even after he acquires his name, the main characters have a conversation about whether it sounds dorky. And even with the 'Daredevil' name, the old 'Devil of Hell's Kitchen' moniker lingers on, with Karen, Brett, Frank, even Matt himself using the old name, and even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em>, the Hand leaders use the Devil of Hell's Kitchen name.</li><li> Wilson Fisk is never referred to as 'Kingpin' in Season 1. Although there are many references to his nickname in Season 1: Ben Urich uses a playing-card motif to chart out the conspiracy, and refers to Fisk as "the King of Diamonds"... with a large white <em>pushpin</em> stuck through the card; at one point Blake calls him "King Freakin' Kong". In Season 2, Fisk finally adopts it as a moniker after having disposed of Dutton, the previous kingpin of the drug trade in the prison, and finally gets his signature white suits when he gets out of prison in season 3. Ultimately in season 3, the "Kingpin" name becomes the codename that dirty FBI agents on his payroll use to describe him in briefings and whatnot.</li><li> The Owl is only referred to by his real name of Leland Owlsley.

The closest we come to getting to him being called "Bullseye" is a visual nod when Fisk is walking through Dex's medical records, and is interpreting the incident where Dex killed his baseball coach with a baseball. Said coach was wearing a cap with a bullseye on it.</li><li> While individual members of The Avengers are alluded to several times, only Captain America is mentioned by name all of once, when Foggy says, "I might as well be Captain America.

To clarify, the city is infested to the brim with gangs, criminal organizations, mobsters, gangsters, drug lords, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">extremely violent people</a>, corrupt officials, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">dirty cops</a> and junkies. There is vulnerability of rights in many of its citizens, particularly those with few opportunities, and most people live in constant terror because of the ineptitude of the authorities and rampant corruption. The first season already presented us with a very dark environment, where many criminal organizations want control of Hell's Kitchen and half of the police are blackmailed by the mob. Basically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">Wilson Fisk</a> and his mob control the police and the press. And that's not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya">the Russian mob</a>, a heavily armed syndicate of ruthless gangsters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanTraffickers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanTraffickers">who kidnap and sell women and children on a regular basis</a>. Season 2 gives us <em>an even worse view</em> of the city, even without Wilson Fisk's involvement. After the imprisonment of Fisk, we have an extremely brutal vigilante known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">The Punisher</a> fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob">The Irish Mob</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCartel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCartel">the Mexican cartel</a>, and practically <em>everyone</em> involved in the death of his family. And it is without mentioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">The Hand</a>, a <em>very</em> powerful Asian crime syndicate that kidnaps and poisons kids. And finally, in the third season, Wilson Fisk makes all his effort to get out of jail, establishes a criminal conspiracy that involves other mob bosses, and this time he's in charge of the FBI for his protection. You know that something is <em>really wrong</em> when the same law enforcement agencies are vulnerable and many of them <strong>serve as minions of the same mobsters they fight with</strong>.

The symbolism is a little confused, since while Matt did sacrifice himself for Elektra in <em>The Defenders</em>, his sacrifice didn't save her.

The fight ends with Dex incapacitating Matt by stabbing him in the collarbone with a pair of scissors and dropping a bookcase on him, then he goes into the room where Karen, Foggy, Ellison and Jasper are hiding.

Really the only less-than-happy things about the ending are that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ray Nadeem is dead (though not before making a posthumous confession video for bringing Fisk down), and Dex is being experimented on and is clearly going to come back to be an enemy again</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a>:<ul><li> It is late in Season 2 when Stick teaches Matt a way to track the ninjas through their breathing.

In Season 1, the main gangs he works with are the Russians, the Chinese, and the Yakuza. It's mentioned early in Season 2 that some of the Kitchen Irish even went to work for him. In addition, he gets two African-Americans as allies, in the form of his lawyer Big Ben Donovan (on loan from Harlem, and who is taking up a lot of the consigliere duties Wesley used to hold) and incarcerated accountant Stewart Finney. On his release from prison, he starts organizing parlays to impose his new "protection from prosecution" tax on other criminals, resulting in him presiding over a secret meeting that includes members of the Maggia, plus a black gangster, and a Rabbi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>:<ul><li> In Matt's first three scenes he saves a stranger, at the cost of his sight, takes confession with his priest, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierandGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierandGorier">snaps a human trafficker's femur with his bare hands.</a></li><li> The first thing we see Foggy doing is waking up Matt with a phone call, making fun of his (supposed) sex life, and soft-bribing Sgt.

A short time later, he decapitates Anatoly with a car door for embarrassing him, establishing that his terrifying reputation is <em>well</em> founded.</li><li> Dex gets two ones that establish his different main character traits. The first is in Episode 2 when he singlehandedly kills a team of Albanians who try to assassinate Fisk during his transfer to an FBI safehouse, and executes the last two survivors as they're preparing to surrender, establishing that he is a very formidable killer. The second is in Episode 4, where he pulls a prank on Fisk by taking a bite out of his burger before sending it in, and then watching Fisk through the cameras to see just how he reacts, which shows that he has a fondness for doing petty things for his own amusement.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment">Establishing Series Moment</a>: For some, the opening fight scene with Matt attacking Turk's gang of human traffickers at the docks, as it is far more brutal than we're used to from the MCU, giving people a taste of just what they're in for with this one.

However, Matt generally stops shy of lethal force and tries to direct his brutality towards criminals while Fisk's ambitions often impact everyone including innocent lives.</li><li> Fisk started off as a meek child who abhorred violence and gradually became murderous. The Murdocks' familial dark side is a penchant for brutality, yet Matt keeps it in check despite being trained as a warrior.</li><li> Fisk's father was abusive and coerced him into violence, while Matt's father was very loving and never wanted him to fight.</li><li> Both men were shown to be offered alcohol as kids.

Matt considers Fisk to be truly evil, but Fisk has people he cares about, specifically Vanessa, Wesley, and his mother, for whom the feelings are mutual. This makes it much more difficult for Matt to paint Fisk as the monster he wants him to be. Fisk is distraught when Karen kills Wesley, as Wesley was the closest thing he had to a friend.<ul><li> In Season 3, Fisk's love for Vanessa is strong enough that when he learns she'll be facing accessory charges for her part in his enterprise, he agrees to turn informant for the FBI in exchange for the charges against her being dropped. This ultimately puts Fisk in a place where he can wrap the FBI around his thumb and can also sell out competitors who will pose an obstacle to his empire.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>: In "Speak of the Devil", Father Lantom talks about witnessing an event in the Rwanda genocides of 1994 where a militia tried to kill a village elder by cutting his head off with a machete. Then after seeing how much his followers loved him, they couldn't go through with it and just wanted to give him a quick death by shooting him instead.

When she thinks Daredevil caused the bombings, she's reluctant to work with him. She also has disdain for Reyes and her response to the fact that Reyes has a serious shot at the Mayor's chair by building an anti-vigilante platform off Frank Castle's conviction or persecution of types like Jessica Jones, is to take a very bitter drink.</li><li> Frank has no interest in killing Matt, even when he has Matt at his mercy, as even after all the people he has killed, he only cares about targeting the gangs affiliated with the Central Park shootout. He also doesn't unmask Matt despite having him at his mercy since he doesn't care who he is under the mask. He later tells Karen that he wasn't trying to kill her when he was chasing down Grotto, whom she was protecting at the time, because he only goes after criminals who deserve it. In addition, he has a bit of extra hatred for anyone who'd deal in (or presumably make or read, etc.) child pornography. After buying supplies from a pawn shop dealer, the dealer offers him child porn. He responds by killing the guy with a baseball bat.<ul><li> One of Frank's victims at the Kitchen Irish bloodbath is the son of Finn Cooley. A few episodes later, Finn Cooley captures Frank and is preparing to torture him for...his money that Frank stole. Even though Frank is making it his mission to kill people like this, he's still rather incredulous about this kind of attitude.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Frank Castle:</strong> Your kid's in a box.

She doesn't like talking about her life before she came to the big city, given what happened that caused her to leave town: she was an addict, shagging a dealer named Todd Neeman, and who deferred going to Georgetown twice because she knew her father and brother wouldn't be able to run the family diner without her. One night, after a heated argument, her brother burned down Todd's trailer and Karen shot Todd with the gun in his truck as he tried to kill Kevin with a tire iron.

Karen nods in response to a "yes/no" question Matt asks her, then laughs in embarrassment when she realizes he didn't see that. Karen holds a newspaper to his face to show an article about Fisk.

As Matt's being led past the cells, the prisoners whisper and whistle at him. Anyone who knows prison culture knows that whispering is a big red flag because it can signify that you're a "stool pigeon," AKA a snitch.

In Season 3, he offers Foggy the floor at a police union gathering so Foggy can give a speech rallying the NYPD behind his District Attorney campaign.

Pretty undesirable for anyone other than a blind tenant. A fake Craiglist ad put out for the apartment right before the release of Season 3 lists the rent as being around $2,000 a month, which ain't exactly cheap.</li><li> Karen's various apartments are all large for the job she currently has. In Season 1, working an entry-level job at Union Allied, her apartment is quite big, with a distinct bedroom. In Season 2, as a secretary for a struggling law firm, she's downgraded to living in a large studio apartment. In <em>The Defenders</em> and Season 3, she's living in a large, well-furnished apartment, even though she's a brand-new newspaper journalist (not a high-paying job) and somehow also starts paying Matt's rent on top of her own. They do suggest she's financially strained in Season 3 (she comments when having dinner with Ellison's family that this is her first home-cooked meal in months; while the first episode of Season 3 sees her asking Foggy to chip in a bit to help with the rent).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">Full-Circle Revolution</a>: Nelson &amp; Murdock's successful takedown of Wilson Fisk at the end of Season 1 leaves a vacuum for several new syndicates like the Kitchen Irish, Dogs of Hell, and at least one faction of the Hand, to move into Hell's Kitchen.

The injuries to his face sustained in prison are substantial enough that people don't recognize him in public. That said, he plays it straight: he gets drilled through his foot when Finn tortures him, and does spend time in the hospital, but even though the trial takes place less than two weeks after the torture scene, Frank never is shown wearing a cast on his injured foot or having a limp. It's further established in his own show that Frank just is that formidable at enduring injuries, though also averted as Frank also sports scars from injuries here in <em>Daredevil</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood Law</a>:<ul><li> Brett Mahoney ostensibly gets a promotion midway through Season 2 for capturing Frank Castle, supposedly going from "Sergeant" to "Detective sergeant," and transitioning from a uniform to plainclothes suit-and-tie. In the NYPD, that's not a promotion, but a lateral transfer &mdash; Brett's rank actually is still Sergeant, but he's now the supervisor to a squad of detectives in the Detective Bureau rather than a group of ten to twelve uniformed cops in the Patrol Bureau. This does slightly line up with the comics, where Brett is a Detective instead of a patrol officer. Also, the rank title isn't "Detective sergeant," but "Sergeant &mdash; Supervisor Detective Squad". In Season 3, he's officially ranked as a Detective with a Detective's shield, which would be a <em>demotion</em> as Sergeant is a supervisory rank while Detective is the same rank as Patrol Officer.</li><li> The trial of Fisk's assassin John Healy seems to happen within a week of the original crime, given that Ben Urich's subway line piece, discussed early in the episode when Healy has just been arrested, is visible in the issue of the <em>Bulletin</em> on his desk when Karen visits his office at the close of the trial. Murder cases, if not plea bargained, are seldom heard in less than a year after the event. However, it is clear that Fisk had bribed and/or intimidated a number of the jurors, and it is also heavily implied that he may have also bribed the district attorney and prosecutors to fast-track Healy's trial. Why neither Matt or Foggy thought the unusually fast turnaround time was suspicious is another question.</li><li> A justified example: in "World on Fire," Detectives Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman, two corrupt cops working for Fisk, shoot and kill a Russian thug in a precinct interrogation room for speaking Fisk's name. If it weren't for the fact that Fisk has the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau in his pocket, Blake and Hoffman would have been placed on modified assignment and administrative leave while an investigation was conducted into their actions. Because of Fisk's connections, Blake and Hoffman remain on active-duty, allowing them to participate with the other corrupt cops to kill the survivors of Fisk's bombings of the Russians' hideouts. It's lampshaded by Ben Urich when he sees Blake and Hoffman assuming command of the scene where Matt has holed up with Vladimir and a police officer who stumbled upon them, and comments "Detectives! I'd thought IAB would have you riding a desk after that thing with the Russians at the station", to which Blake says "You see what's going on here? No one's riding a desk tonight."</li><li> On a sidenote, Blake and Hoffman giving orders at the standoff. NYPD Detectives are at the same level in the chain of command as regular Patrol Officers, and technically can't give orders to anyone but junior detectives. Only those in the supervisory ranks (Sergeant and upward) can give orders to other cops. Then again, they and many of the other cops in their precinct are on Fisk's payroll, so they probably know that they're breaking protocol.</li><li> In Season 1, Marci Stahl could have faced disbarment for handing over confidential work product. However, lawyers have an obligation not to participate in crimes and to tell the police if they have reason to believe their client will commit a crime. Landman &amp; Zack has failed in both obligations (by not reporting that they are doing legal business for Wilson Fisk and not reporting his crimes to the cops), and it's her responsibility, legally, ethically, and professionally, to hand over all the information she can to the proper authorities. That she handed that information over to the lawyers on the opposing counsel (one of whom she used to have a romantic relationship with) is <em>very</em> questionable, but the New York Bar Association probably gave her a free pass given how extensive Fisk's corruption of the legal system went.</li><li> Fisk is incarcerated at Riker's Island in Season 2. However, that is a state correctional facility. In real life, Fisk would probably be housed in a federal penitentiary, maybe even on death row, especially given that many of Fisk's crimes in Season 1 were federal offenses, such as the bombings of the Russians<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8z0n6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8z0n6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8z0n6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Since 9/11, the bombs would be considered as weapons of mass destruction</span>; racketeering and money laundering (which fall under RICO statutes), and capital <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">Felony Murder</a> charges (for each of the FBI agents killed by Fisk's mercenaries during their ambush on the convoy).</li><li> Because the NYPD does not allow real-life precinct numbers to be used in works of fiction, the police station shown in this show and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em> is designated as the '15th precinct'. Hell's Kitchen is actually serviced by the Midtown North precinct.</li><li> The botched sting using Grotto as bait for the Punisher. Reyes appears to give orders to the ESU to shoot to kill when they open fire on the Punisher, while the Punisher is busy fighting with Matt. The goal of the ambush is to kill Frank Castle, not arrest him. This is a blatantly illegal attempted extrajudicial killing. The circumstances under which the police are allowed to use lethal force do not include &#147;because he did some bad stuff before.&#148; While defense of others (Grotto) could be used as a justification, the police opened fire before that was established. Furthermore, the operation was overseen by Reyes. In real life, the police department and the prosecution are separate entities, explicitly for this reason.<ul><li> In real life, Reyes would be lucky if she just got disbarred for this. Using a man as bait for a killer is illegal, as is misleading said guy's defense attorneys. Nelson &amp; Murdock arguably would have a case to file a wrongful death suit against Reyes and probably would have prevailed, and that probably would've gone down if, well, Frank's trial didn't come in the way.</li></ul></li><li> The <em>People of the State of New York v. Frank Castle</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2016/06/14/daredevil-season-2-part-1/#more-2805">is an<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2016/07/10/daredevil-season-2-part-2-the-trial/">exercise in this trope<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>:<ul><li> After Frank is arrested, Matt, Karen and Foggy discuss the case with Frank's public defender (who is taking Karen's statement on the hospital shooting), who considers the case open and shut: Frank will plead guilty and be sentenced to death for murders he committed in Delaware, which has the death penalty. In real life, in Delaware, and every other state that has the death penalty, the decision to impose the death penalty must be determined by a separate hearing. And that hearing normally includes a jury, even if the defendant pleads guilty. It is possible for both the State and the defendant to waive a hearing before a jury, but even then there will be a hearing before the judge. The defendant can&#146;t plead straight to the death penalty.</li><li> When Nelson &amp; Murdock first attempt to approach Frank at the hospital, Reyes attempts to intervene, arguing that speaking to Frank without his attorney present would be a violation of ethical rules. This is simply not true. Ironically, it <em>would</em> be an ethical violation for Reyes to do the same thing because she represents an opposing party (i.e. the People), per N.Y. Rule 4.2(a). And indeed, Matt correctly tells her as much. At the same time, Reyes fails to note that Matt and Foggy's conversation with Frank might be an ethical breach for a different reason, namely that it&#146;s an inappropriate in-person solicitation under Rule 7.3(a)(1).</li><li> While negotiating over a plea deal with the District Attorney for Frank Castle, Foggy mentions that one thing Reyes didn't go for is having him in protective custody. However, it's the New York Department of Corrections who determine which prisoners get put in protective custody. Castle is suspected to have killed a bunch of gangsters from three different gangs, so he would almost certainly be placed in protective custody, since these gangs undoubtedly have incarcerated associates who would be itching to kill him in revenge for murdering their comrades.</li><li> The DA argues that Nelson &amp; Murdock can&#146;t represent Frank because it would be a conflict of interest given their representation of Grotto. This is very wrong for several reasons. For one, Grotto isn&#146;t a current client, since a) he summarily fired the firm in no uncertain terms, and b) he is dead. This still makes Grotto a <em>former</em> client, which could cause conflicts under Rule 1.9, but those can be avoided in this case. The main concerns are 1.9(a)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9x5bn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9x5bn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9x5bn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person&#146;s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing</span> and 1.9(c)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note101wgi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note101wgi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note101wgi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which limits the use or disclosure of the former client&#146;s confidential information</span>. Representing Frank would not require doing anything materially adverse to Grotto&#146;s interests, especially given that he is dead and had no family or estate (remember that Matt, Karen and Foggy were the only attendees at his funeral). Neither would it require disclosing anything that Grotto told the firm in confidence. So Nelson &amp; Murdock are clear to take Frank&#146;s case.</li><li> Nelson &amp; Murdock are literally given <em>one week</em> of prep time before the trial. In real life, following the arraignment (i.e. when Frank pleaded "not guilty") and assuming Frank waived grand jury proceedings, a complex trial like this would be preceded by several weeks or even months of depositions, motions, and hearings, mostly to establish what kind of evidence could be presented to the jury. This is especially in important in cases like this one that rely heavily on expert testimony. Corrupt or not, Reyes wouldn&#146;t want to rush this, either. And even if they did, it would be extremely unusual (and likely appealable) for the judge not to grant the defense an extension of time before the trial started. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11be2g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11be2g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11be2g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> For a real life comparison, Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes was arrested immediately after killing 12 people and injuring 58 more on July 20, 2012 and didn't even start discussing plea deals with the district attorney until March 27, 2013 &mdash; more than eight months later, and his actual trial didn't start until two years later, and just the process of jury selection took three months.</span> From a narrative standpoint, this shortened prep time is somewhat justified, due to the necessity to keep the trial on pace with the Elektra storyline. On the other hand, it does help explain in part why Nelson &amp; Murdock&#146;s defense of Frank Castle was essentially malpractice-level awful.</li><li> "Fast tracking" in most states means means getting it to trial in fewer than 12 months, not a week. It involves a shit ton of discovery (basically searching and sifting through all sorts of potential evidence, along with answering questions, producing documents, and depositions). That takes MONTHS if not over a year to go through.</li><li> At the start of the trial, the judge remarks about the difficulty of selecting jurors, because "everyone has an opinion" about the Punisher. Such a situation should have been handled with a change of venue, the process of moving a jury trial away from a location where a fair and impartial jury may not be possible due to widespread publicity about a crime and its defendant(s) to another community in order to obtain jurors who can be more objective in their duties. This change may be to different towns, and across the other sides of states or, in some extremely high-profile federal cases, to other states.</li><li> The seal behind the judge implies that the trial is in federal court. If it were in federal court, the prosecution would not be done by the District Attorney but by the United States Attorney. The seal also identifies this court as the "United States District Court for the District of New York City." There is no such court, the correct district in Manhattan would be the "Southern District of New York."</li><li> There's a long, dramatic sequence where Frank is brought into the courtroom in chains and a prison jumpsuit, which would never be done in real life because it could bias the jury. The Supreme Court has ruled that the State isn't allowed to make a defendant wear that in court. A prisoner may choose to appear that way, if for some reason they want to bias the jury or just don't know what they're doing. But preventing a defendant from appearing in the dehumanizing garb of a prisoner is so crucial that <em>public defenders</em> often hold clothing drives to make sure their clients can dress up.</li><li> More egregious is that what is shown of the trial on-camera <em>isn't even about the crimes that Frank had committed</em>. Everyone acts as if what had happened to Frank&#146;s family is far more relevant to the current case than it should have been. Having a trial about what kind of man he was when his character wasn&#146;t on trial was just weird. His sanity maybe, but the evidence against him was staggering.</li><li> When Frank takes the stand, spectators in the gallery are holding signs decrying him as a vicious murderer who should be burned at the stake. Such signs should <strong>not even be allowed in the courthouse</strong>, never mind an actual courtroom. At another point, a person in the gallery begins shouting that Castle killed his father. The judge orders the person removed, but Nelson &amp; Murdock should have seized the opportunity to request a declaration of a mistrial. Even if they didn&#146;t get it, it would be yet another issue they could appeal if the trial went badly (which it does).</li><li> Matt and Foggy's defense of Frank centers around Extreme Emotional Disturbance, hoping that if they prevail they can get him the help he needs rather than sending him to prison. Per the New York State penal code, an EED defense merely mitigates a Second or First Degree Murder charge to First Degree Manslaughter, which would still mean Frank would go to prison rather than a mental hospital. Although manslaughter carries a shorter sentence than murder, the fact Frank is being charged with 37 counts of it would presumably keep him away for a long time especially if served consecutively &mdash; which may almost be the equivalent of a life sentence (not to mention the fact that Matt and Foggy wanted to keep him out of prison due to the fact that he'd be a walking target for other inmates).</li><li> A key part of Nelson &amp; Murdock&#146;s defense strategy was convincing Dr. Gregory Tepper, the medical examiner, to come clean about being asked to falsify the records of the deaths of Frank's family. Initially hesitant, the medical examiner decides to change his story on the stand and tell the truth. The judge clears the courtroom (although in reality she almost certainly wouldn&#146;t just because a witness was testifying unexpectedly), and the medical examiner spills the beans and explains that he was forced to confess because Elektra had threatened him the night before. The judge strikes Tepper&#146;s testimony&#133;and Matt and Foggy do nothing but have a fight in the courthouse bathroom, rather than appeal the judge's motion. This is a concept in civil and criminal procedure known as &#147;preserving an issue for appeal.&#148;<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12z3cj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12z3cj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12z3cj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Basically, if the judge makes an error during the trial, if one side doesn&#146;t object during the trial, then it&#146;s much harder or even impossible to appeal the error to a higher court later.</span> Doing nothing, not even giving a verbal objection, about an issue this important, which could have affected the outcome of the trial, is a colossal screwup.</li><li> There is the issue of whether Tepper altering the medical records is relevant to the case at hand. In federal courts and many states like New York, a witness&#146; veracity for truthfulness is relevant. Even if Elektra hadn't threatened him, Dr. Tepper's altering medical records would discredit his testimony, which could be introduced on cross-examination. Confronting Dr. Tepper with evidence of falsifying medical records would be potentially devastating and extremely relevant to Frank&#146;s case. However, as the medical records would have been collateral, the Judge would have limited questioning to avoid confusing the jury with facts not material to Frank&#146;s case.</li><li> Expert witnesses, such as the doctor who testified regarding Frank&#146;s brain injuries, are allowed to give their expert opinion regarding facts (e.g. Frank suffered a brain injury that affects his judgement) but not legal conclusions (e.g &#147;any infractions would be considered crimes of passion&#148;). Drawing a legal conclusion from the facts (e.g. whether Frank was legally insane) is the job of the judge or jury, not the witness. Also, "crimes of passion&#148; really only applies to converting murder to manslaughter, which is still a serious crime, and murder is not the only crime that Frank Castle has committed onscreen (false imprisonment, torture, etc).</li><li> It is generally a bad idea for criminal defendants to testify in their own case. It opens the door to uncomfortable questions from the prosecution, and there is rarely much the defendant can say that will help rather than hurt their case. This is true in Frank&#146;s case, yet Nelson &amp; Murdock have Karen talk Frank into testifying. This is arguably a breach of ethics, because although Matt and Foggy treat Karen as if she is a partner with equal weight in decision-making, she is a secretary, not a lawyer. Per NY Rule 1.2(a), the decision of whether to testify in one&#146;s case is, ultimately, the client&#146;s decision, not the attorney&#146;s. And not only do the rules specifically contemplate that the client will consult with the lawyer, but it&#146;s implicit that this consultation is a core part of advising (though not deciding for) a client in a criminal case. Thus, what Karen did likely constitutes unauthorized practice of law. And it's a breach of ethics for Matt and Foggy to have someone else doing their dirty work.</li><li> Not only that, as Frank was so opposed to the PTSD defense, they should have had him removed from the court so he couldn&#146;t talk even if he wanted to. Lawyers are not allowed to let their clients sabotage their own cases; that&#146;s just super bad lawyering. There also may be an issue of perjury going on, since Matt, Foggy and Karen know their client is guilty of crimes, but has pleaded not guilty.</li><li> Matt&#146;s disastrous examination of Frank is worth pointing out. After a few questions, Matt asks the judge for permission to treat Frank as hostile, then launches into a long, rambling expository speech. In real life, permission to treat a witness as hostile means "treat the witness as though he or she had been called by the opposing party." This doesn&#146;t change much. Mainly it means that Matt can now ask Frank leading questions (i.e. questions that suggest a particular answer is desired). It definitely does not mean Matt can ask &#147;questions&#148; that are long speeches better suited for a closing statement. The only thing that saves Matt is Reyes failing to object to just about every sentence he utters...</li><li> ...and Reyes' only objections are to Matt's cross-examination questions, citing them as &#147;leading.&#148; When the entire point of cross-examination is to ask leading questions to control the witness, which is allowed. It is equally wrong to object to cross-examination as argumentative, because cross-examination by its very nature is supposed to be argumentative to discredit the witness.</li><li> Somehow, Nelson &amp; Murdock are able to get Colonel Schoonover as a character witness and not have his deposition. Reyes gets tripped up and embarrassed by the "actually I <em>was</em> there" trap. This doesn't happen in real life because there's a pretrial deposition of any and all witnesses so that neither defense nor prosecution are just playing a guessing game. It doesn't matter if Schoonover's name was redacted on classified mission reports. Deposition questions from Reyes would be like "what's the nature of your relationship to Castle?" "Why do you endorse his character?" "Were you there to personally witness the mission?" Etc etc. This is simple stuff that non-attorneys should think, "there's no way that this happens in real life." You can't just plop a witness on the stand who hasn't been deposed.</li><li> Matt and Karen going over strategy for the medical examiner. "Who doctored those certificates? And if he says 'no one' then we already got him admitting they were doctored!" Uh, Matt, Karen, that's gonna be shouted down by Reyes as "Objection. Assumes facts not entered into evidence," as in assuming the "fact" that the certificates were doctored at all. You have to lead to it, i.e. Establish and enter it as evidence by asking all sorts of boring questions leading to "were the reports in any way doctored?" You don't get to say "so, who doctored them?" That's assuming something not yet in evidence. It's like asking a murder suspect "so, when you killed the victim, did you do it with a candlestick or a bat?"</li><li> Sentencing for Frank after he got himself convicted would take several weeks of more hearings, although one could assume Fisk was pulling strings to get Frank to him before the sentencing could send him to another prison.</li><li> There are an insane number of conflicts of interest on hand for Nelson &amp; Murdock:</li><li> 1) Karen was among those caught in the crossfire when Frank was shooting at Grotto in the hospital.</li><li> 2) As well as Foggy and Karen having been present for the attempted police ambush.</li><li> 3) Frank asks Foggy to leave the room so he can speak with Karen alone. While Karen works at a law firm, and Matt and Foggy do treat her as if she's a partner with equal footing in decisions, she is a secretary / office manager, not a lawyer. She doesn't have a law degree. Without a lawyer present, anything Frank says to Karen might not protected by attorney/client privilege, and she could be subpoenaed to testify under oath about what he said to her. In fact, her one-on-one conversations with Frank without Matt or Foggy being present may constitute <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law#Unauthorized_practice_of_law">Unauthorized Practice of Law<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. So unless Karen is a certified paralegal, it's unlikely she would be permitted to take statements as she did with Frank both at the hospital and in jail on her own, and it's very unlikely that she would be able to sit at the defense bench in a criminal trial.</li><li> 4) Matt personally witnessed Frank kill Grotto. So he knows the guy is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</li><li> 5) Frank was caught because Matt performed a citizen's arrest of him while in costume as Daredevil.</li></ul></li><li> Several episodes feature police cars with forward-facing blue and red lights. New York state law prohibits forward-facing blue lights on police vehicles.</li><li> It's very unlikely in real life that a white-collar criminal like Stewart Finney would end up in the same prison as violent murderers like Wilson Fisk. Finney, however, explains when he introduces himself to Fisk that he got caught because he double-crossed the brother of a very influential Justice Department official, so it's possible the official in question pulled strings.</li><li> At the beginning of the Season 2 premiere, we see Matt and Foggy arrive at the office and Karen fills them in on the clients in their waiting room. While the scene is funny and is meant to convey the eccentricity of Nelson &amp; Murdock's clientele, Karen is publicly disclosing each individual&#146;s legal problem in earshot of the other clients, <a class="urllink" href="http://thelegalgeeks.com/2016/03/20/nelson-murdock-worse-client-consultations-ever/">potentially a violation of a New York attorney&#146;s duty of confidentiality to a prospective client<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> As <a class="urllink" href="http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2016/06/14/daredevil-season-2-part-1/">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2016/07/10/daredevil-season-2-part-2-the-trial/">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> demonstrate, almost <em>everything</em> about the way the series presents the law is not just wrong, but wildly wrong.</li><li> In Season 3, when Fisk has the FBI go after Matt's friends, Karen asks Foggy to be her attorney as she fears that Nadeem will find out she killed Wesley and either send her to jail or have her killed. Foggy asks her to give him money as that will officially make him her lawyer. In real life, you do not have to give an attorney money for attorney-client privilege to be in effect.</li><li> At the end of Season 3, Foggy sketches a doodle for the trio's new firm on a napkin, calling it Nelson Murdock &amp; Page. Thing is, Karen is not a lawyer, and in New York, it's actually a violation of ethics for a non-lawyer to have a partnership stake in a law firm.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2018/12/20/making-at-deal-with-daredevils-kingpin/">As this article points out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the circumstances behind Wilson Fisk's release from prison in Season 3 are semi-plausible but there are some liberties.<ul><li> One example being that the sort of deal Fisk makes (information on the Albanians in exchange for charges against Vanessa being dropped) would more likely be made with the DOJ or the U.S. Attorneys&#146; office, not with the FBI. Decisions to charge or not to charge lie with prosecutors, not investigators.</li><li> Another example is the decision to put Fisk up in a penthouse at the Presidential Hotel, following two attempts on his life (one of which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a>). The Federal Bureau of Prisons has an established protocol for protecting prison informants and has special housing units available to keep them safe. Simply put, there should be no need and no reason to move Fisk to a hotel penthouse. A lot of this can be explained away as being because of Fisk's machinations (since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">Fisk had paid Jasper Evans to shank him</a>, and the agent in charge of Fisk's protection detail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">is actively working for him</a>), but not all of it.</li><li> Once Fisk gets his conviction overturned, the authorities suddenly act like they must get him on new charges. Unless the judges ruled that there was insufficient evidence against him for any reasonable jury to convict him though (quite unlikely) a retrial on the same charges could take place. He could also be tried on state charges in New York without regard to the outcome of his federal case.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>: In the first season finale, the mercenaries rescuing Fisk are standing out in the open, unloading at the FBI agents while slowly advancing in a line. Despite this, the FBI agents get mowed down without giving the mercenaries much trouble. There's at least an attempt at realism, where one or two of the mercenaries <em>do</em> get hit and go down, but considering that they are exposed, and the FBI agents are mostly behind cover of some kind, means this should not have gone as easily for them as it did.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>: Ben Urich not taking the editor job despite the pay raise which would allow him to better take care of his wife because he wants to continue chasing stories with more value than puff pieces. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He gets killed after he decides to start a blog and post his article about Fisk on the internet.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HospitalityForHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HospitalityForHeroes">Hospitality for Heroes</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> when Foggy takes Karen to Josie's. He says that since he and Matt helped the owner with legal trouble, they drink for free. Then Josie herself comes by, as if on cue, and says they absolutely do <em>not</em> get to drink for free. However, Season 2 reveals that she allows them to rack up a gigantic tab with little indication that she expects them to pay it off. When Foggy closes it out and implies that he won't be coming back for a while, she seems disappointed. She's still warm and friendly when Matt and Foggy come by Josie's for drinks in <em>The Defenders</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocrisyNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocrisyNod">Hypocrisy Nod</a>: Matt acknowledges the hypocrisy of being a lawyer dedicated to the law who is also a vigilante.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a>: In Episode 5, Fisk tells the other crime lords that he killed Anatoly. He explains that they'll make Anatoly's brother Vladimir think the Devil of Hell's Kitchen was responsible, at least, until they are ready to make a move against him, saying "We all knew that we would need to eliminate the Russians one day. They were too unpredictable." This, as Leland points out, comes from a man who just decapitated Anatoly with a car door because the guy interrupted his date with Vanessa.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>:<ul><li> A lot of attention is called to the fact that Matt enforces the law as a lawyer, while simultaneously breaking it with reckless abandon by acting as a superhero. Similarly, he and his priest struggle with the fact that he's a Catholic who may have to actively kill a man.</li><li> Even Foggy can sometimes get this. Yeah, in "Nelson v. Murdock" he's right to call Matt out for being Daredevil, but Foggy is guilty of doing the same thing (going out and putting a stop to crime) to a lesser extent, if his using a softball bat in "Stick" on a pair of thugs trying to jump Karen are any indication.</li><li> While Karen is one to call Matt and Foggy out for holding secrets, she's seemingly ignoring the fact that she's kept secret from them the fact that she killed James Wesley, as well as her secret past regarding her brother Kevin.</li><li> Leland Owlsley calls Fisk out on his relationship with Vanessa, thinking that she's distracting him from getting on with his criminal ventures.

The characterization goes toward the theme that Matt keeps most people at arm's length due to the advice of Stick, and he allows Foggy to assume that his nights are spent in the company of dates rather than running around beating the shit out of criminals. Season 2 further complicates this characterization when it's revealed that Matt was in a long-term relationship with Elektra during college, and Foggy recalls how miserable Matt was after the relationship ended.

Much of their sexual tension stems from them each feeling the other is too good for them, due to their dark secrets causing them to put on metaphorical masks where they hide their darker side around each other. Even after Matt does come clean to Karen about his secrets, Karen's still insecure during <em>The Defenders</em> about her feelings for Matt not because she knows he cares for her, but because she's now afraid of how he'll react if he ever learns about what she did to Wesley.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: Wilson Fisk is, and should be only, called James Wesley's "employer."

The realization that he's been driving them away leads Matt to decide to willingly tell Karen his secret, with everything hinting at a future reconciliation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>: While there have been deaths of a couple characters that have been undone by the Hand, each season has some significant character deaths that stick: there's the Russian brothers (Anatoly and Vladimir), Elena Cardenas, James Wesley, Ben Urich, and Leland Owlsley in Season 1; Samantha Reyes, Colonel Schoonover, and Nobu in Season 2; and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Julie Barnes, Father Lantom, and Ray Nadeem</span> in Season 3.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingpinInHisGym" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingpinInHisGym">Kingpin in His Gym</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Frank Castle is introduced to the man himself lifting weights in prison.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Knife Nut</a>: Rance, the assassin sent after Karen when she's retrieving the Union Allied flashdrive, is <em>particularly</em> fond of the knife, especially given that when Wesley threatens Farnum's daughter to get his cooperation, he explains that Rance's methods are "unpleasant".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan">Koan</a>: Many characters use flowery and/or metaphoric expressions sprinkled in their dialogue.

Marci eventually drops the selfishness act after Foggy persuades her to turn against her colleagues at Landman &amp; Zack and sell them out for aiding Fisk. By Season 2, she's been hired on at Hogarth Chao &amp; Benowitz and has become a somewhat nicer person.

The last significant Mafia boss in the neighborhood was Rigoletto, who was killed on Fisk's orders and the Russians take over his drug distribution network.

For instance, Matt and Karen walking out of Frank's hospital room arm-in-arm in "Regrets Only" gets echoed in the Season 2 finale when he rescues her from the Hand, as he carries her to safety in the same arm-in-arm pose. Matt cupping Karen's face before he kisses her at the end of "Penny and Dime" gets called back in the Season 2 finale, as he strokes her face again in a very similar way upon cutting her restraints. During the "You're not alone, Matt" conversation towards the end of "The Ones We Leave Behind," there's a shot of Matt standing in the foreground and facing away from a shaken-up Karen, staged very similarly to a shot from the first episode, when Karen interacts with him in the mask after he defeats the assassin Fisk had sent to her apartment.</li><li> Matt's exchange with Karen while she helps him get dressed for Grotto's funeral...<div class="indent"><strong>Karen Page:</strong> You okay?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> Yeah.

Matt is also a "cut man", and the episode introduces Claire.</li><li> &#147;Rabbit in a Snowstorm&#148; introduces the titular painting, as well as its impact on Fisk (caught up in something bigger/what man you want to be).</li><li> &#147;In The Blood&#148; deals with the Ranskahov brothers, as well as the idea of not being able to run from something because it&#146;s in the person's blood (Ben Urich takes the case; Fisk's criminal enterprise; and Matt's fighting)</li><li> &#147;World On Fire&#148; is how Matt describes his form of sight to Claire. The episode ends with Fisk literally setting most of Hell's Kitchen on fire as he blows up the Russians' hideouts.</li><li> &#147;Condemned&#148; sees Fisk use the media and police reception in order to make Matt a terrorist. It's also an apt decription of the dilapidated building where Matt is holed up with Vladimir and a police officer who stumbles upon them.</li><li> &#147;Stick&#148; introduces Matt&#146;s mentor of that name, as well as arms Matt with a primitive version of his trademark escrima sticks</li><li> &#147;Shadows In The Glass&#148; reveals Fisk&#146;s insecurities and how he is haunted by shadows of his former self</li><li> &#147;Speak of the Devil&#148; not only deals with personal demons, but also weighs heavily on the old saying &#147;Speak of the devil and he shall appear&#148; (ie: Fisk appears at the art gallery when Matt asks Vanessa about him, Fisk appears on TV while they&#146;re talking about him at Josie's, etc)</li><li> &#147;Nelson v.

Additionally, it deals with the continuing costs of walking this path (ie: Claire leaves Matt, Fisk loses Wesley and almost Vanessa)</li><li> &#147;The Ones We Leave Behind&#148; deals heavily with those lost as well as whom they&#146;ve left behind. Continuing from the previous episode (ie: Vanessa saved, Wesley killed), the episode also shows how one is almost lost at the start of the episode only to have another truly lost at episode&#146;s end (Karen dreams Fisk is about to kill her in her apartment, Fisk actually kills Ben Urich in his apartment)</li><li> &#147;Daredevil&#148; &mdash; Matt is no longer the Devil of Hell&#146;s Kitchen and earns the title of Daredevil in both the media as well as resembling his comic appearance (red horned costume with balanced beat sticks)</li><li> "Bang" &mdash; Frank Castle says "bang" before shooting Matt in the head</li><li> "Dogs to a Gunfight" &mdash; Frank Castle uses the dead body of a Dogs of Hell biker as bait for the NYPD and engages in a fight with Matt while under fire from the ESU teams</li><li> "New York's Finest" &mdash; The motto for the NYPD is applied here to Matt and Frank, two vigilantes, but can also apply to Claire</li><li> "Penny and Dime" &mdash; Refers to the children's book that Karen finds in Frank's house, as the last book Frank ever read to his daughter before her death</li><li> "Kinbaku" &mdash; This type of bondage appears in visual form with the knots Elektra uses to tie Roscoe Sweeney to a chair</li><li> "Regrets Only" &mdash; as in "the past catching up with you". Matt is starting to drift apart from Karen and Foggy as he gets more and more focused helping Elektra.</li><li> "Semper Fidelis" &mdash; The episode marks the start of the trial of Frank Castle, a former Marine, who use this phrase as a motto</li><li> "Guilty as Sin" &mdash; Frank sabotages his own trial.

Bill's idea of "making a man" out of Wilson involved demeaning him, teaching him to blame others for his problems (including blaming Wilson himself for his own problems) and playing cruel jokes on him. When he lost the city council election, he believed that the reason he lost was because his wife and son didn't show him enough respect at home, not because he was a vile, vicious, petty loser. This led to him beating his wife with a belt, and caused Wilson to snap and kill him with a hammer.</li><li> In the present day, Fisk tends to operate on the principle that he should do the opposite of what his father would do in a situation. As such he owns up to his mistakes and then moves on, eventually. But he has his moments: after Matt foils Fisk's attempt to escape from police custody, Fisk goes on a villainous rant, clearly blaming Matt for the downfall of his operation. While it is true that Matt was the driving force, both in his civilian and vigilante lives, behind Fisk getting arrested, this is ignoring that the major factors that led to his descent were due to his own temper tantrums for minor slights (to elaborate, a string of events that began with Fisk brutally murdering Anatoly for simply crashing Fisk's date with Vanessa, which led to Fisk bombing the Russian mafia's hideouts, then sending in corrupt cops to finish off the survivors, then ordering the shooting of Detective Blake for accidentally leaking info to Matt, having Blake be killed in the hospital by his own partner Hoffman when this fails, Hoffman being stashed away by Leland Owlsley, then Hoffman selling Fisk out to the FBI after Fisk kills Leland in another tantrum). Not to mention the fact that he's, y'know, a criminal, and thus deserves to get arrested.</li><li> Nobu has an example of this in "Shadows in the Glass," after his Black Sky is killed by Stick, when he angrily confronts Fisk about not providing the Black Sky more protection. Fisk points out that Nobu only asked for the docks to be cleared of police interference and he held up that end of the deal, and it was Nobu's responsibility to inform Fisk of the importance of the incoming cargo.</li><li> Karen repeatedly claims it wasn't her fault that her brother died, despite the fact it was her actions (doing drugs and hooking up with Todd), bad choices (driving while angry and under the influence) and refusal to accept her brother and father's help that directly resulted in Kevin's death. She finally owns up to it when she and Matt are hiding from Dex in the church basement in Episode 11 of Season 3.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide">Never Suicide</a>: The first episode alone had not one, not two, but <em>four</em> attempts to cover up a murder as a suicide.

Furthermore, her doing so in front of Felix Manning means that Matt finds out about this after torturing Felix for info, and he is able to use this against Fisk to make sure that the latter will never reveal his identity or target his friends again, since if he does, Matt will make sure Vanessa goes to jail</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a>:<ul><li> Done repeatedly by Matt to the various criminals, partly out of rage and partly because he's an otherwise-normal man who needs to hit them multiple times to keep them down.

"Condemned" has both Vladimir and Fisk claiming this about him, although he repeatedly tells them they're not the same.<div class="indent"><strong>Fisk:</strong> You and I have a lot in common. <br><strong>Matt:</strong> We're nothing alike.</div><ul><li> A major theme throughout the show is the similarities Matt and Fisk share. Both had traumatic experiences in their childhoods that have shaped who they are, both were strongly influenced by their fathers, both believe they are helping the city become a better place and use unlawful means to do so. At one point, Foggy even questions how Matt's methods are any different from Fisk's.</li><li> Frank Castle also states how he sees Matt and himself to be very much alike. In his own words: "you know you're one bad day away from being me."</li><li> Season 2 in general expands on this. Frank Castle, Elektra, and Stick all argue that Matt is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from them, and Matt finds himself straying closer to them at times. For instance: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Agreeing with Frank that Matt's way isn't working, so "just this once" he'll help Frank find and kill the Blacksmith. Later, Matt apparently having his "one bad day" and throwing Nobu off a roof by his neck. Matt finally pushing Foggy and Karen almost completely out of his life, just as Stick suggested, and finally agreeing to run away with Elektra, wherever she wants to go to stay hidden from The Hand.</span></li><li> In Season 3, Fisk recruits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Agent Poindexter</span> to his side by showing him how much they have in common.</li><li> On the heroes' side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Matt and Karen</a>'s individual pursuits of justice (through Daredevil and through investigative reporting, respectively) are very similar in their determination and unwillingness to stop even when it means jeopardizing their own safety. This is especially noticeable in Season 1, where her quest for justice is very much parallel to Matt's:<ul><li> Both Matt and Karen have the tragedy of a car accident in their past. Matt was blinded by one, while Karen killed her brother in one.</li><li> Just as Jack Murdock&#146;s death profoundly changed Matt, the murder of Daniel Fisher wakes Karen up to the reality of the corruption and violence that&#146;s taking place in Hell&#146;s Kitchen. While she gathers other people later who serve as motivation for her cause, from the very beginning it&#146;s Daniel Fisher&#146;s inescapable ghost that prompts her to fight back. His memory keeps her going out there, even after two attempts are made on her life and after she is bribed to keep silent. Just like Matt's memory of his father.</li><li> Ben encourages Karen to hide her nighttime activities, but as a person already prone to keeping secrets due to the events that happened in her past, it&#146;s likely that she would have done so anyway. She lies to Matt and Foggy from the day she meets them, and this continues even after she begins working to bring down Fisk. The parallels with how Matt hides his Devil of Hell's Kitchen activities from Foggy and Karen are obvious, and there&#146;s dramatic irony in one scene where Foggy tells Matt that he thinks Karen is up to something and Matt dismisses his concerns saying, &#147;Everybody has secrets, Foggy.&#148;</li><li> Just like Matt, Karen manages to keep her friends in the dark for about half of the show until Foggy discovers the truth on his own due to finding them having just been attacked by Fisk's thugs (discovering Karen being menaced by thugs; finding Matt bleeding out from being maimed by Nobu and beaten up by Fisk).</li><li> Just like Matt is not dissuaded by Foggy's concerns about what he does at night, Karen is not dissuaded by Matt's concerns about what she's doing. She comes back at him with a very Daredevil-esque response: "Y'know, I don&#146;t care what I signed or how much money they paid me to forget, I don&#146;t. And I&#146;m not just going to stick my head in the sand and let it happen to somebody else because I am scared! Which I am&#133; a lot.&#148;</li><li> As Karen goes out there and takes risks and digs deeper into Fisk&#146;s business, she gets noticed. While Fisk&#146;s immediate priority may be dealing with the damage Matt is doing to his organization, it&#146;s not long before he notices the other, much more subtle type of vigilante showing up where she doesn&#146;t belong. Just like Foggy's "You're gonna kill yourself if you keep this up" to Matt, Ben warns Karen to be careful, but she knows that care won&#146;t get her the results she needs, and so she takes risks. Just like Matt gets a bit too confident and careless and ends up being maimed in a fight with Nobu, Karen gets a little too confident and careless and ends up being threatened at gunpoint by Wesley. Unlike Matt, though, it is Karen who gets the honor of receiving the standard supervillain threat of "Back off or I'll kill everyone you care about".</li><li> Wesley threatens to have Matt killed to scare Karen and cause her pain. The fear of Karen getting killed when she's kidnapped by the Hand in Season 2 is enough that Matt can't focus and Elektra needs to rein him in.</li><li> In a show that deals extensively with Matt&#146;s internal conflict about killing, it&#146;s Karen who actually takes that step, and must deal with the consequences. Killing Wesley, although saving her life, takes a toll on Karen: Clearly traumatized, Karen resorts to alcohol to avoid the chronic anxiety that now colors every moment of her life. And Matt burning Nobu alive, although saving his life, takes a toll on him as Foggy finds him bleeding out in his apartment right afterwards.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">Nothing Is the Same Anymore</a>: For the main trio of Matt, Karen and Foggy, the first big change of dynamics is when Foggy learns Matt's secret identity in "Nelson v.

Karen and Matt don't really reconcile until the season finale.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>:<ul><li> Wilson Fisk allows Madame Gao to believe he cannot understand Chinese, but later reveals that he is somewhat fluent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyUnnecessaryTranslator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyUnnecessaryTranslator">His obfuscation has mostly been so that he has an excuse to have Wesley around for their meetings.</a> Madame Gao, who also pretends that she does not speak English and requires a translator, can see through Fisk's ruse.</li><li> Matt uses obfuscating ignorance in everyday life. He can effectively "see" just fine, can hear conversations from blocks away, and can tell whenever anybody is lying to him, but he has to act like an average blind man anyway and play along.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousStuntDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousStuntDouble">Obvious Stunt Double</a>: Averted during most of Matt's action sequences thanks to the mask, dim lighting, and the fact that Charlie Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster share a vague resemblance, although it's clear that Cox didn't do much of the second season finale's climactic fight scene. Played painfully straight with Stick, whose action sequences are mostly of a much younger double wearing a wig with a few insert shots of the real Scott Glenn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse">An Offer You Can't Refuse</a>: At the start of Season 3, Nadeem is summoned to Rikers to meet Fisk in prison. During the meeting, Fisk asks Nadeem if he has anyone in his life he loves and would do anything for. Nadeem thinks Fisk is threatening his wife, but actually, Fisk is referring to Vanessa, and wants to provide information on rival criminals in exchange for her continued protection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>: Matt Murdock and Karen Page. While their instant attraction to each other in Season 1 is not initially obvious due to their preoccupation taking down Fisk, it's still apparent (Karen thinking Elena is talking about Matt when she refers to "the handsome lawyer" instead of Foggy; Matt insisting Karen continue translating for Elena because he likes the sound of her voice). By Season 2, it's been six months since Fisk has been locked up, giving them more time to explore their feelings for each other, and they finally get a moment of intimacy by sharing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRain">a first kiss in the rain</a> after Frank Castle is arrested.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCoupleOrdealSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCoupleOrdealSyndrome">Official Couple Ordeal Syndrome</a>: Once Matt and Karen begin dating, Elektra reenters Matt's life and essentially hijacks him, causing him to falter in contributing to Frank Castle's trial.

While they're estranged for most of the third act of the season due to this and their own individual pursuits of the Hand and the conspiracy behind the death of Frank's family, in the final scene of Season 2, Matt privately meets with Karen to reveal his secret identity, hinting at the possibility of them reconciling. By the time of <em>The Defenders</em>, they're back on speaking terms, and their interactions are very intimate, but things fall apart again as Matt is "killed" in the destruction of Midland Circle.

In the first season, the NYPD are very ineffective at doing their jobs because so many cops in the 15th Precinct are in Fisk's pocket. In the third season, Fisk is able to use his influence to turn the FBI into his glorified bodyguards and henchmen.<ul><li> Ray Nadeem becomes a more specific example in Season 3. When Fisk "names" Matt Murdock as a faciliator, Nadeem doesn't even bother doing any fact-checking of Fisk's information to observe that Matt worked for the law firm that took down Fisk, and that Fisk could be using him as part of a vendetta against Matt.

It's implied Karen is aware of this too.</li><li> Matt has a big problem with this, due to trying to keep his nighttime activities as Daredevil separate from his day job as an attorney. A lot of the conflict in Season 2 would not have happened, and Nelson &amp; Murdock's breakup would've been avoided, if Matt had just told Foggy and Karen right away that Elektra was back in town when she deposited the money into their bank account, rather than wait until Elektra threatened their key witness in Frank Castle's trial to do so.

They are temporarily driven apart in the second half of Season 2 by Matt's nighttime activities and Karen finding Elektra in Matt's bed, and while Matt privately meets with Karen to disclose his secret and it's later confirmed that they reconcile, they don't fully re-enter an official relationship, and still have not done so by the end of Season 3, despite their obvious care for each other.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>:<ul><li> The "Nelson v.

When they were writing Season 1, the writers had no idea if there would be a Season 2, or that it would contain Elektra, and so Foggy's &#147;Greek girl&#148; line was another nod for the comics fans. Additionally, in the "Nelson v. Murdock" flashbacks, Foggy suggests that Elektra was in Spanish classes with Matt, when the flashbacks of Matt and Elektra's college relationship establish that while Elektra was financially connected to the college, she wasn't actually attending classes.</li><li> Flashbacks in Season 3 show Matt acquainted with Father Lantom when he was still in his teens, whereas Season 1 seemed to suggest Matt didn't know Father Lantom for that long at all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a>: When Matt patches up Claire's injuries from her time as the Russians' captive, she briefly wonders whether Matt is one of those playboy types she keeps hearing about on the news.

It was actually Ellison's secretary Caldwell.</li><li> In the first episode of Season 2, Brett and Turk mention to Matt on separate occasions that they hear rumors of a new crew in town with military precision. It's then established that these killings are solely the work of Frank Castle. But then, towards the end of the season, Colonel Schoonover's crew turns up, made up of former soldiers who served alongside Frank in Operation Cerberus.

And Foggy is certainly justified in having a few issues with the things Matt does, in and out of costume. However, the fact that Matt isn't fully deserving of Foggy's trust does <em>not</em> make Matt fully deserving of Foggy's unyielding, unending condemnation, especially when these criticisms start becoming less and less about what Matt <em>does</em>, and more about who he <em>is</em>. Eventually, in "Seven Minutes in Heaven," Matt's response to getting yet another lecture from Foggy isn't to argue back, but to calmly respond, "I'm not gonna stop, Foggy. Not anytime soon.

The Albanians even send a hit squad to try and assassinate Fisk as the FBI are moving him to his penthouse, but Dex manages to foil the attack. That said, though, Vic Jusufi, an incarcerated Albanian boss at Riker's, proves to be a very reasonable man and Matt is able to convince Jusufi to have his men smuggle Matt out of the prison during a riot orchestrated by Fisk, after Matt agrees to let them have a turn with Fisk once he's reincarcerated and gets them to reveal Jasper Evans' name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">Sacrificial Lion</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ben Urich</span> is murdered by Wilson Fisk near the end of Season 1.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltAndPepper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltAndPepper">Salt and Pepper</a>: In Season 3, Fisk has a pair of crooked lawyers who are this trope, with Benjamin Donovan (the pepper) and Nicholas Lee (the salt).

Frank seems to have issues with them claiming it was the violence he experienced on the battlefield as a soldier that was giving him problems. Frank corrects them by saying "It wasn't on the battlefield where my life went to shit". True enough in that his own show establishes that only what he went through under Rawlins' illegal CIA program and the murder of his family seem to be what's giving him nightmares. Frank's issue is probably not wanting to go with what he sees as a lie. He is suffering PTSD, just not as a result of what Foggy and Matt were trying to pin it on.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan">Sharp-Dressed Man</a>: Foggy spends most of Season 3 sporting three-piece suits by Martin Greenfield Clothiers.

In spite if his vigilantism, Matt maintains that murdering someone, even with good cause, is a mortal sin. The one time he actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">goes out with the intention to kill anyone</a>, it's a misguided attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution">murder Wilson Fisk</a> to avenge Elena...a hit that Fisk had ordered both to allow the Hand access to their Midland Circle property and also to lure Matt into an ambush from Nobu.

This is how Fisk finds out that he talked with his mother; the mole was one of the witnesses.</li><li> Leland admits to culpability in Vanessa's poisoning, believing himself safe because of a complicated insurance plan involving stashing away Hoffman. This after commenting repeatedly throughout the season on Fisk's violent temper and unstable, homicidal tendencies (he did call Fisk out on killing Anatoly), and his generally unpredictable behavior when emotional, <em>particularly</em> where Vanessa is involved. He does all this when he is alone with Fisk in an alley and Fisk confronts him on these charges. Fisk throws him down an elevator shaft with barely a second's hesitation and then orders a hit on Hoffman.</li><li> The pawnbroker from whom Frank Castle acquires an NYPD communications rig. While he has no way of knowing that his customer is the Punisher, it's pretty reckless to openly admit that he deals in child porn and underaged prostitutes to someone who just walked in with a duffel bag full of weapons and bought stolen police equipment. Violent criminals, just like everyone else, take a very dim view of such matters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>:<ul><li> Wilson Fisk is coming closer to his Kingpin persona after being in jail and losing most of his power.

When Karen approaches him in Season 2 to get his backing on the Frank Castle story, she's expecting him to see her as a replacement for Ben, and is surprised when Ellison instead proves much more helpful, genuinely shows concern for her and expresses great regret over not having backed Ben's work. A freeze-frame of an assignment board in "Seven Minutes in Heaven" shows that he also has revamped the editorial priorities to focus on important events instead of fluff pieces.</li><li> Foggy's appealing to how Marci Stahl "used to have a soul" gets to her. Not only does she readily turn in her partners, but in both of her appearances in Season 2, we can see that since joining Hogarth Chao &amp; Benowitz, Marci has become considerably nicer and has a more amicable relationship with Foggy. While Marci only gets one shot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em>, it's clear she and Foggy are forming a healthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeRomance">Office Romance</a> at HC&amp;B.</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>, Jeri Hogarth was incredibly amoral, even engaging in criminal behavior and trying to use Kilgrave to get Wendy to agree to lesser terms during their divorce. When she shows up in the Season 2 finale of <em>Daredevil</em>, it's pretty clear that she's cleaned up her act greatly, and is back to something very close to what she used to be like when she interned at Rand Enterprises, as she's impressed by Foggy's defense of Frank Castle to the point of hiring him on with the explicit promise of making him a name partner. Though <em>Jessica Jones</em> Season 2 suggests that any change was probably just an act put on for Foggy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToplessnessFromTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToplessnessFromTheBack">Toplessness from the Back</a>:<ul><li> Is used in the first episode to show Karen from behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyShirtSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyShirtSwitch">while she's switching into one of Matt's dress shirts</a>.</li><li> Used twice in "Kinbaku", first when Matt and Elektra have sex in the boxing ring at Fogwell's in the midst of a sparring match turned sexual foreplay.

All without a single word or the slightest change of expression.</li><li> By Season 3, Fisk has almost conquered his notoriously uncontrollable temper, turning his moments of rage into this. When Karen taunts him about how she killed Wesley, it's almost shocking to see that he manages to keep a lid on his homicidal fury for even a few seconds whereas before he probably would have lunged at her immediately. Of course, in that case he might have been simply too paralyzed by rage to do anything. It's played straighter three episodes later, when he receives news from Agent Waller that Karen escaped Dex's assassination attempt in the church and is now in the wind; Fisk absorbs this and then calmly, even casually, asks Waller for his jacket. He waits patiently as Waller removes the jacket and hands it over. Fisk proceeds to wrap said jacket around Waller's head and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger">beats him to death</a>.</li><li> Karen's visit to Fisk in Season 3 Episode 8 has her also going into this state as soon as Fisk brings up his knowledge of Matt's secret.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting">Two Lines, No Waiting</a>: The manhunt for Frank Castle makes up the sole plot for the first few episodes of Season 2.

Fisk's mini-arc in Season 2 was primarily to set him up for his return as the main villain of Season 3, considering that D'Onofrio was the first confirmed cast member outside of Matt, Karen and Foggy to be announced for Season 3.</li><li> Season 3's utilization of Rosalie Carbone as one of several crimelords who gets roped into a protection racket scheme that Fisk is running, after her prior role in <em>Luke Cage</em> Season 2.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendLoveLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendLoveLife">Urban Legend Love Life</a>: At least as far as season one goes.

Yet Matt is hesitant about her finding out about his alter ego as the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. They do get close enough to begin dating partway through Season 2, but this is short-lived before Matt gets sidetracked helping Elektra and ends up neglecting Frank's trial and his relationship with Karen. They do get closer together once Matt reveals his secret to her, and even in <em>The Defenders</em>, the attraction between Matt and Karen is still evident in all their shared scenes, but now what gets in the way is the fact that Karen is still processing the whole matter of Matt being Daredevil and hasn't yet come clean with him about Wesley's death, followed by Matt's "death" under Midland Circle.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing">Vagueness Is Coming</a>: According to Stick, some sort of war is coming, and Daredevil will be a vital part of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Season 2 reveals this war is against The Hand, but Stick continues to be vague as fuck.

Foggy, who's been angrily chewing Matt out for the duration of the episode about his recklessness and perceived betrayals, can only muster a single horrified curse and shudder when he hears this.</li><li> Then there's the season finale, where it's clear that Matt has no choice but to do this to stop Fisk from fleeing the country (and Matt similarly explains to Foggy when he goes out to rescue Hoffman from the corrupt cops sent to kill him).

However, the introduction of Claire, as well as Matt's crime fighting delay any full relationship from blossoming. In Season 2, the pair have their first date, but Elektra and more crime fighting split them apart. They're back to speaking terms in <em>The Defenders</em>, but Matt is presumed dead at the end. Matt spends most of Season 3 trying to flee his life as Matt Murdock and hides from Karen, causing her to be extremely angry with him when they do reunite.

Even with the damage done by the Incident, it's clear the real-life gentrification of Hell's Kitchen happened in the MCU. It's just that the alien invasion undid a lot of that. Because of the real-life gentrification, Hell's Kitchen looks nothing like it did in the 1990s, so Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint are used as shooting locations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: Wilson Fisk is a master of this trope.<ul><li> When Nobu is becoming too much for Fisk to handle, he asks him to send a specialist to fight the Man in the Mask, who is also a problem.

Fisk then double-crosses Frank by locking him in and releasing Dutton's men from their cells to kill him. When Frank kills them all instead, Fisk even turns <em>that</em> to his advantage by arranging for Castle to be smuggled out of the prison disguised as a corrections officer. Frank even realizes exactly what Fisk is doing: he wants Castle to resume his crusade against crime, weakening Fisk's rivals enough to put Fisk in a better position to strengthen his own operation once he's finally released. It also allows Fisk to get retribution against Matt and Foggy, the two lawyers defending Frank, and whose meddling with the tenement case caused Fisk's incarceration, by destroying their firm as collateral.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>: They appear in Season 1 as allies of Wilson Fisk, led by the sinister Nobu.

This is especially notable in Season 3 where he gets his entire FBI detail in his pocket by digging up dirt on them and / or threatening their families, leading to them testifying against him once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nadeem's confession video goes public</span> and he gets arrested anyway, and especially with Dex, who turns on him the moment he learns that Fisk killed Julie just to undermine his sanity further. The public at large alternates between loving him and loathing him depending on what they think about him is true, and at the end of the day he's just plain unable and unwilling to invest in genuine loyalty rather than mere obedience, basically giving members of his own organization every reason to want him to somehow fail.</li></ul></div><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">I can't do this alone</a>. <br><strong>Karen Page:</strong> You're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">alone</a>.</div></dd></dl>
