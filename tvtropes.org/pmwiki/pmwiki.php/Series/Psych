Continued fan interest has led to <em>Psych</em> being revived as a series of TV movies. There is no set release schedule, however, as each is produced whenever the cast can spare the time. The first movie, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a> simply entitled <em>Psych the Movie</em>, aired in December 2017.

Especially not to be confused with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, which featured an obsessive/compulsive who effectively possesses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">Photographic Memory</a> and the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">observe and put together clues</a> too subtle for the average person to pick up, and which was a USA Network original series, just as <em>Psych</em> was. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Because we all know</a> a television network would <em>never</em> stoop so low as to copy one of its own hits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nor use the series finale to indicate <em>Psych</em> and <em>Monk</em> are set in the same universe</span>.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>Psych</em> provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes A to H&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABNegative">AB Negative</a>: The culprit in "This Episode Sucks" was targeting people with O- blood because he suffered from a rare blood disorder and could no longer afford the frequent blood transfusions he needed.

Adult Shawn is also upset by the fact that, when he was eight, Henry hid Shawn's Easter eggs by burying them five feet underground. Henry claims that he left loose dirt to indicate a fresh dig to make it easier. Shawn points out that this fresh dig was hidden under a <em>camouflage tarp</em> covered with <em>bricks</em> and <em>broken glass</em>.

Except that when Shawn and Gus investigate, they realize that the football player was already dead when the text was sent. Closer investigation reveals that he'd died in an ATV accident.

The only reason he even tries to kill Lloyd and Henry later on is because Lloyd stole some US Mint plates from him.</li><li> <em>Psych: The Movie</em> has two examples. First there is El Proveedor, a local fence. He crosses paths with Shawn when the former comes looking for the engagement ring that was stolen in the series finale. When Shawn's "premonitions" end up coming true for El Proveedor, he is so grateful that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only does he track down the engagement ring, he officiates Shawn and Juliet's wedding.</span> The second example is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Allison Crowley's</span> nameless henchman who is dubbed the "Black Gentleman Ninja" by Shawn and Gus.

Additionally, not giving Juliet his jacket leads Shawn to propose to her at one of the crime scenes they visit to search for clues while giving her his jacket leads them to resolve their problems and get back together once the case is solved.

We never actually see how she works (though its hinted to be somewhat like Lassiter), but in the penultimate episode, we see her manage to nab the criminal before Shawn (albeit, Shawn was hindered with Gus suffering nightmares at the time.)

It starts with Juliet's dream about her and Shawn being alone... which is in Shawn's dream about him with a giant stack of pancakes... which is in Gus's dream about Pluto being made a planet again... which is in Lassie's dream about Shawn finally giving up the Psychic Detective business.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedAfterThePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedAfterThePilot">Dropped After the Pilot</a>: The show gave Detective Lassiter a female partner (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/House">Anne Dudek</a> appeared as the competent and skeptical Detective Lucinda, no last name given, partner and lover of the major character Carlton Lassiter) with whom he was having an affair and who was suspicious of Shawn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">"psychic" abilities</a>. Post-pilot she is never seen nor heard of again, she's transferred out in the second episode because of the affair thing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondEpisodeSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondEpisodeSubstitute">replaced</a> with Shawn's trusting, less skeptical eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, Junior Detective Juliet O'Hara.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotIronic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotIronic">Dude, Not Ironic</a>: Shawn is a little unclear on the definition.<div class="indent"><strong>Shawn:</strong> That's ironic, right? <br><strong>Gus:</strong> What's ironic is that you have to keep asking me what irony is.</div><ul><li> Discussed in the first tie-in novel <em>A Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Read</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">Dude, Where's My Respect?</a>: Shawn's unorthodox methods have been the deciding factor in arresting murderers, thieves, con artists, and even serial killers. Many times over the course of the series the Santa Barbara police would have imprisoned the wrong person, and many people would be dead, without Shawn's help. Despite this, every week the cops say they don't have time for his "hunches," his help is not needed, and please get out of the way so the "real" cops can do their jobs. This is especially noteworthy for Detective Lassiter, who is perpetually dismissive and condescending toward Shawn, despite the fact that he would be rotting in jail for a murder he didn't commit if Shawn hadn't cleared his name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: The pilot has Lassiter paired with a different junior detective, with whom he's having an affair. She's gone by the second episode, and Lassiter's estranged from his wife. Lassiter would also become much more morally upright (and so not the person to have an extramarital affair with a co-worker) and more inept with the opposite sex. Shawn also worked a variety of jobs which on rare occasions had esoteric relevance to the plot. That disappeared relatively quickly and was replaced by Shawn learning his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">Chekhov's Skill</a> in a flashback at the beginning instead. Shawn's also more hostile and belligerent towards Lassiter in the first episode, whereas in later episodes he becomes more playful, if still disrespectful.<ul><li> In the first few episodes, Shawn routinely claims to be speaking with and interacting with ghosts. That went away quick. And just in general, Shawn puts far more effort into his fake psychic episodes in the first couple of seasons, as opposed to later seasons where he mostly just puts his hand to his head and says "I'm getting something..."</li><li> In Juliet's first appearance, we see a photograph of her parents who Shawn guesses have been together for 30 years (from her reaction, we can assume he's right) and her father does not resemble Frank O'Hara as portrayed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> in later seasons.</li><li> In the first two episodes, young Shawn is played by a different actor each time. The flashback in the second episode takes place later than most episodes, so Shawn was about thirteen. Beginning in the third episode, young Shawn was played by Liam James, and the flashbacks generally took place in a particular year which advanced with each passing season.</li><li> Shawn and Henry's relationship is played for angst in the first couple of episodes. This quickly shifts to a more light-hearted bickering while flashbacks become goofier and show young Shawn giving as good as he gets.</li><li> In the first season, the Psych logo on the window is blue instead of green. (In the season eight episode "Cloudy...With a Chance of Improvement," which is a remake of season one's "Cloudy...With a Chance of Murder," the logo is blue in the first scene as a nod to this detail, then green for the rest of the episode.)</li><li> In the pilot, Shawn is a sharp-shooter. He re-uses Lassiter's partner's target sheet, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">hits each hole she has already shot</a>. Shawn rarely uses guns after that.

It's made extra funny both times by the fact that James Roday's real last name is "Rodriguez" and his father is Mexican.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingHobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingHobby">Embarrassing Hobby</a>: In the episode "Not Even Close...Encounters", a childhood friend of Shawn's, who has grown up to be a rich, successful lawyer with a hot girlfriend, is revealed to have a secret room in his house where he keeps an extensive collection of comic book and sci-fi memorabilia and toys. He begs Shawn not to let his girlfriend know.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong">Entertainingly Wrong</a>: Constantly on the show, mostly with Shawn as despite his great intellect and skills, he often jumps to the wrong conclusions based on his lack of real police experience.<ul><li> One episode opens with a flashback of Henry finding Shawn writing a book report on <em>Charlotte's Web</em> despite not having finished the book. Shawn says he doesn't see the need as it's perfectly obvious what will happen: Wilbur wins the prize at the fair and he and Charlotte live happily ever after. A smiling Henry bets Shawn a trip to Disneyland he gets an A and Shawn already starts planning it with no idea he's about to fail.</li><li> This ties into the rest of the episode as Shawn is about to accuse a man of murder but Henry interrupts to point out the guy is innocent because of a detail in his file that Shawn didn't bother to read. Shawn has to turn it around to make it look like he <em>meant</em> to accuse the innocent man to "flush out" the real killer. This also ties into the plot of Shawn working with what he believes is a think tank working out how to stop the kidnapping of a millionaire...only to realize too late they <em>are</em> the kidnappers and he's just given them the plan.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>: Shawn usually gets one well in advance, but later has to set up the summation to maintain his role as a psychic.<ul><li> Later parodied when Lassiter, without explanation, yells out "I know who the West Side Rapist is!" while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">tap dancing with a class of children at a recital</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>: Several examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a> that are still criminals.<ul><li> "A Very Juliet Episode" involves a powerful mob boss who was convicted of murdering a federal agent, and whose wrath was keeping Jules' ex-boyfriend in witness protection. Turns out he didn't do it: he prides himself on honor and especially on not killing and doesn't want his children to grow up thinking he was a murderer. Likewise, he himself is not after Jules' ex, though he can say nothing about those who would kill the man independently to gain his favor. He ends up hiring Shawn and Gus to find the real killer in exchange for making sure Jules' ex is never troubled again.</li><li> Desperaux likewise draws the line far below killing, though he is not above a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighAltitudeInterrogation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighAltitudeInterrogation">High-Altitude Interrogation</a>.</li><li> The duo of robbers in "Barbie And Clyde" are perfectly fine with lying, cheating, robbing and swindling folks out of their money and possessions, but likewise draw the line at killing.

By Season 3, his need to be as obnoxious as possible even when it seems likely to get him killed has become as pathological and uncontrollable as Adrian Monk's phobias. This is actually referenced in the show, where it's suggested that his success has completely gone to his head.<ul><li> It is also suggested, in the first Yin episode, that Shawn may be intentionally playing up his quirks as a way to avoid having to deal with the stress and fear that comes with the job.</li><li> Also Gus's eating, at first both Shawn and Gus where bit of big eaters, but in Season 7, Gus had eaten a pit of meat that he found in the woods (which could have <em>killed him</em>) also eaten some more meat later in the same episode,(which everyone thought was Lassister!) Also, one a guy suddenly dies, Gus wanted to know if their could share his food.</li><li> Lassiter also became more and more uptight and rigid as time went by with more humor revolving around this.

"Turn Right or Left For Dead" explores this in addition to how events follow in an investigation, one where Shawn goes home with Juliet and another where he himself runs into the victim and it changes the outcome. The two versions have different color timing too, with the apparent "happier" version much warmer (and has Shawn and Juliet as almost completely OOC).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>: The beginning of every episode involves Henry teaching young Shawn a valuable lesson about crime-solving.
