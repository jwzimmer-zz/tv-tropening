Abby is confused as to how liquid nitrogen used to kill the victim had traces of food in it, and Palmer is the one to suggest that the nitrogen was delivered via the victim's thermos.

In the parent show, they were shown as arrogant investigators who would overlook evidence and miss connections that Harm, Mac, Bud, and others would need to find so justice would be done. It is shocking in some instances when this is compared to the general appearance of agents who look into various leads and don't discount the implausible.<ul><li> While Gibbs's astounding bad luck in the marriage department was well-known from the beginning of Season 1, it wasn't until the end of Season 3 that we learned about Shannon and Kelly and the immense trauma their deaths had on Gibbs.</li><li> At the start of the series, Gibbs was a lot more talkative, smiled more often, and had just as many quips as the other characters.

Their friendship and its backstory was only developed in the season two finale.</li><li> The black-and-white shots that start and conclude each segment didn't begin until about 1/3rd of the way through the second season. For those who started watching the show later in its tenure, watching the first season episodes with regular fade/cut to black can be <em>very</em> strange.</li><li> A great many of the recurring guest stars who show up at least once a season in the later years (as in, all of them other than Fornell) were introduced fairly late.

In a later season episode when Gibbs finds Leroy's old war medal at a pawn shop, we learn his full name is Leroy Jethro Moore, he's still very much living and Jackson has a long-running grudge against him that results in him even barely acknowledging the man exists.</li><li> In season 1 and early season 2 it's implied McGee and Abby have some kind of relationship, but what exactly it entails is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">never explained</a> and the whole thing seems to just be forgotten about by the end of season 2</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>: In one episode, the team finds a voice synthesizer speaking individual words, including "...yankee, white...".

On top of that, Tony was shipped off to various boarding schools shortly after the death of his mother, while Dinozzo Sr. remarried several times.<ul><li> Ducky's father worked a lot but his stepmother takes the cake: she ditches her son and stepson <em>on Christmas Eve</em> (her son's cool with it "I thought she'd never leave"); it's later revealed she was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting surprise divorce papers and leaving the country with her son purely to spite the Mallard men</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In "Bears and Cubs", Ducky decides it's time for him to retire.

One memorable example is in the season 10 episode "Hit and Run," where Abby has called in sick, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(but she was really having bad memories that interfered with her work)</span> leaving a flustered McGee to run her lab, and when Major Mass Spec acts up, Gibbs starts smacking it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">Perky Goth</a>: Abby, and her actress, Pauly Perette, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating">Perp Sweating</a>:<ul><li> Oh, can Gibbs make them sweat. One of the best examples involves taking the suspect down to Ducky's area to "prep" him. It involves Ducky and Gibbs telling the guy exactly how he's going to be <em>dissected</em>. This is <em>after</em> Gibbs kills the guy and makes it look like a suicide, which it is heavily implied that he wouldn't hesitate to do if the guy didn't cooperate.</li><li> Sometimes, when Gibbs can't make them sweat, he gives Ziva a turn. Ziva's presence is also occasionally used by Gibbs as a threat: 'Cooperate with us or we'll extradite you to Israel'. This is used on those who would really, <em>really</em> rather <em>not</em> end up in the custody of the Mossad.<ul><li> What makes Ziva's interrogations work is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnReveal">almost never shown on-screen</a>, but it tends to quickly reduce the perp to a crying wreck. In one fairly early episode with a female accessory who won't talk, Gibbs locks her in her office with Ziva. In the next scene, as they're interrogating her, Ziva just slowly, calmly walks around her; the woman is a weepy, trembling mess and flinches like she's been shocked when Ziva lightly touches her neck. In the one instance where we do see her at work (in "Hiatus," after Gibbs is caught in the bomb blast), Ziva harshly interrogates the Turkish ship captain... at gunpoint.</li></ul></li><li> Ducky has also broken several people just by explaining anatomy to them. (e.g. "This is how we cut your torso open", and "this is what happens to your skull when a bullet enters the back of your head.")</li><li> Tony, meanwhile, prefers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExasperatedPerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExasperatedPerp">annoy suspects into submission</a>. He's very good at it; in the season six finale he manages to get the better of Ziva's father (Eli David, the <em>director of Mossad</em>) this way.<ul><li> Bonus points because Tony was the one being interrogated, and still managed to get Eli to spill more than he did.</li></ul></li><li> Even McGee gets in on this.<ul><li> In one episode, he informed a suspect that, as a known member of a gang suspected of terrorist ties, the Patriot Act says that he can be held at their discretion, and he doesn't have to be charged with anything, ever. Whether it's true or not doesn't matter, since the guy believed it. And Gibbs once used McGee as a blunt weapon for the same purpose; he had McGee come in and dryly rattle off a list of consequences, his banal, matter-of-fact delivery making them far scarier than any emotionally delivered threat.</li><li> McGee also had the luck of interrogating a teenage bully...the same kind that picked on him in high school. McGee basically gets buddy buddy with him, discussing the fun of tormenting geeks, then goes scary real fast when he reveals he was the geek in high school, and now he has the gun, badge, and paperwork know-how to make the bully go away for a long time unless the kid tells him where he found the victim's phone, and he's going to <em>enjoy</em> it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">We still don't know if he was serious.</a></li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>McGee:</strong> Do me a favor.

What's the style? <br><strong>Tony:</strong> He's leading with the Creepy Uncle, but I think he's going to with the Father Figure You Can Trust. <br><strong>McGee:</strong> Nope, that doesn't feel right. I'm gonna go with the classic, in your face Gibbs, The Intimidator.</div><ul><li> They do the same thing when Tony is interrogating a suspect. Gibbs wins the bet.</li><li> In one of the first Season 7 episodes, as they're breaking in a possible replacement for Ziva, Tony starts speaking in tandem with Gibbs while observing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in "Murder 2.0" when the suspect is literally sweating and complaining about how hot it is in the interview room while Gibbs is just talking to him, leading Tony to comment with pride on Gibbs' skills. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out the suspect had been poisoned, causing extremely elevated blood pressure and a shortly-ensuing heart attack.</span></li><li> In at least one episode, Gibbs and Fornell double-team an interrogation.<div class="indent"> <strong>Gibbs</strong>: The worst mistake you made... <br><strong>Fornell</strong>: You tried to shoot our agents. <br>(<em>Fornell gets up and takes off his jacket</em>) <br><strong>Gibbs</strong>: Hey, let me hang that up for you, Tobias <br>(<em>Gibbs tosses Fornell's jacket over the security camera while Fornell rolls up his sleeves.

Gibbs sat on a park bench in the pouring rain because he put the dog that was sleeping under the bench in the nearby gazebo so it wouldn't get even more wet. He wouldn't sit in the gazebo with it because it smelled like...well, a wet dog.</li><li> Another literal one with McGee and Jethro (nee Butch), the German Shepherd he shot (in self-defense). McGee was wary of Jethro for the whole episode; at the end, when Jethro is vindicated and Abby's landlord has said "no dogs", Abby makes an impassioned speech to a reluctant Tim about how Jethro is the dog McGee has been wanting to get for a long time. A later episode shows that Abby did eventually succeed in this little campaign, and McGee has a very loving relationship with the dog.</li><li> And yet another literal one in the episode "Seek", with Gibbs' interactions with Dex the military dog. At the end of the episode, he declares with the utmost respect and sincerity:</li></ul><div class="indent"> "That's not a dog. That's a Marine."</div><ul><li> And yet another in "Caught On Tape". When the team gets into a shootout with a suspect who's made it abundantly clear that he won't surrender, Gibbs pauses to whistle to the man's dog (who he'd befriended earlier in the episode) so that the animal will run out of the house to safety.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillowPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillowPistol">Pillow Pistol</a>: Tony teases Kate for sleeping with a gun under her pillow, though Gibbs is impressed.
