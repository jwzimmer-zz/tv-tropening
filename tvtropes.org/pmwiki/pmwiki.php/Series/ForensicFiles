Turns out that the "wife" was actually his daughter that he kidnapped when she was a teenager and had them pose as a married couple while the two little girls are her biological children. Although some believed that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">the father of the girls</a> (and the episode itself implies such), their true paternity is never admitted by anyone, including the mother, and isn't even addressed whatsoever at the man's murder trial.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>: The case of the episode "Memories" took place in 1979-1980 (although was not solved for nearly twenty years) and when the victim had her previously lost memory jogged by some pictures in a baby magazine.

The episode reveals the unlikely chain of events which led to this tragic accident:<div class="indent">Outside on the firing range behind the airgun building, Dan Smith, one of the last competitors of the day, steps up to the 15 yard line. This moves him in front of two sets of safety baffles. Using a modified gun, Smith takes aim and squeezes the trigger. In a fraction of a second, another shot is fired during the recoil phase of the original shot. It happens so quickly, the shooter doesn't know it left the gun. The bullet misses the target, high and to the left. Traveling upwards, it passes underneath the last set of protective baffles, and just three inches over the [protective] berm. It's speeding at 1,200 feet per second. The bullet blasts through the aluminum siding, goes through a storage room, misses a broom and some pipes by less than an inch and then breaks through a second wall, entering the airgun range. Then the bullet does something unbelievable. It strikes an ordinary ceiling tile and...skids along the tile for seven inches before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProjectile">mysteriously changing direction</a>, making a 10-degree turn, and begins a downward path. It slows to about 900 feet per second, penetrates a plaster wall, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheCutie">enters Trey Cooley's head</a>.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a>: Frequently, when investigating someone for the death of their husband or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard">wife</a>, police will discover that the accused had one or more previous spouses who also died under suspicious circumstances. Sometimes, the killer will be convicted for those deaths too, while other times it's left ambiguous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BleepDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BleepDammit">*Bleep*-dammit!</a>: In "Grave Danger", when Clay Daniels's mother-in-law calls him an asshole, the "hole" part is bleeped out while "ass" is left uncensored.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor">Bluff the Impostor</a>: In "If I Were You", a woman grew concerned when she couldn't reach her father, despite the fact that he kept sending cards for special occasions. So she left a message for him reminding him of her husband's birthday and the money he'd promised. When she promptly received a card with a check, she knew for certain that something was wrong as it was <em>not</em> her husband's birthday, nor had he promised any money. It was soon found that her father had been murdered and his killer was continuing to pay his bills and send correspondence to create the illusion that he was alive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter">Bratty Teenage Daughter</a>: Sarah Johnson from "Disrobed" was this as she rebelled against her parents due to them not wanting her to date a boy they disapproved of: an illegal immigrant and a drug dealer who was three years older. Unfortunately, her love for him outweighed her loyalty to them and she murdered them to stop her father from pressing statutory rape charges.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>:<ul><li> "Dressed to Kill" contains one for the episode "Beaten by a Hair". It shows the key evidence Hadden Clark left behind that led to the conviction of the first murder that he committed.</li><li> "The Music Case" had a little girl in Minnesota murdered in her home and authorities initially believed that the murderer from "Tooth or Consequences" killed her as well. Turns out, someone else committed the crime.</li><li> In a more roundabout example, "Dinner and a Movie" has the murderer uses the real life movie <em>Blackout</em> as an inspiration for covering up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wife's</span> time of death. <em>Blackout</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">was loosely based on the John List murders</a>, which the show had previously covered in "The List Murders," though the show doesn't acknowledge this.</li><li> In "A Squire's Riches", Ari Squire was working on his car when it fell on him, which killed him. When the car fell on him, the vibration caused a light to smash on the ground that started an electrical fire. The lead investigator was about to rule it an accident, even though the fire seemed weird as the power was off, until he watched an episode of <em>Forensic Files</em>. The episode in question, "Past Lives", was about a guy who faked his death by a car fire using a dead body. This caused the investigator to take a second look at the victim. It turned out that the victim was actually Justin Newman, a recently missing person who Squire used to faked his death.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canada, Eh?</a>: Several cases take place in Canada. Most noticeably was "Bad Blood" where the victim and her parents speak with thick Canadian accents and even say "Eh?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">Car Fu</a>:<ul><li> "Treading Not So Lightly" has a pretty disturbing variant: a woman had to bring her toddler daughter to work, but since her boss refused to allow the girl to stay in the building, he ordered her to <em>go play in the parking lot</em>, where she was then ran over by a car and suffered severe brain and facial damage.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vh1j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0vh1j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vh1j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although the man who ran her over did so accidentally&mdash;he backed over her, not even knowing she was there and was able to put two and two together after learning of the incident&mdash;and was remorseful, it still was considered a hit-and-run and charges were eventually brought against him</span> Even though the girl was able to recover enough to be interviewed for the episode years later, albeit with permanent disfigurements, she died in her sleep of an aneurysm in 2011.</li><li> In "All That Glitters is Gold", the killer initially tries to get his victim to pull over by ramming her car with his truck. When that doesn't work, he pulls out a rifle and starts shooting.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a>: Occasionally, some of the most outlandish, ridiculous, or improbable stories told by suspects turn out to be true:<ul><li> One episode featuring a woman's murder had the cops arresting a man after his gun matched the ballistics at the scene, his shoe prints matched those found at the scene, and blood from the victim was found on the shoes in his closet. The man insisted that someone must have stolen the items and then returned them after the murder. The police laughed in his face until they discovered that his DNA wasn't a match and his alibi was verified by numerous people. It turned out that a friend of his, who was staying with him at the time, did everything as he described.</li><li> "Stranger in the Night" involves a man who's accused of murdering his mother. He denied it. He then told an improbable story about how he was attacked by a hitchhiker, and when he went home later that night, he saw the same hitchhiker, which caused him to leave.

Their reasoning? She had a job at a fast food restaurant to earn her own money and had a black boyfriend, a fellow honor student. Even though they tried to claim that it was in self-defense, because the father was an associate of terrorists, the authorities had put a hidden audio wire to listen to his conversations and had caught the murder on tape. Aside from the girl's screams, one of the most horrifying moments was when she begged her mother to stop her father from killing her, only for her to hold her down and tell her to shut up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">P&aelig;do Hunt</a>: This is frequently shows up in cases that involve children being murdered:<ul><li> "Home Evasion" concerns the case of a man who was awaiting trial for raping his infant daughter.

He still had keys, he and the boss didn't get on very well, and he left town after the murder. When the police, by sheer luck, got a bag full of evidence to check, they found out that his DNA didn't match. Furthermore, his leaving town was due to an illness.

Who then drops her off (while she's still alive, but bleeding fatally) in a ditch, and removes her jacket, and her pants (her shoes were also lost, when she was removed from her car). Megan's jacket was found at her killer's house, suggesting he took it as a "trophy", but it's unknown why he removed her pants, as her remains were too decayed to indicate if she'd been sexually assaulted, and her pants weren't found at his home suggesting he junked them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof">Shifting the Burden of Proof</a>: While it may not have been intentional, the series definitely seemed to posit that accused parties not proving their innocence was equivalent to guilt. The American legal system does not work this way, and the narrator intoning that the accused "did not have an alibi" or that they "could not prove where they were at the time of the crime" simply does not fly as evidence of criminal wrongdoing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlainInTheirSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlainInTheirSleep">Slain in Their Sleep</a>: In the episode &#147;Family Ties&#148;, a court official and his wife are attacked in their sleep.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a>: Most of the the episodes focus on murder cases or other crimes, such as arson. However, once in a while, there is an episode that focuses on neither, such as:<ul><li> "Breaking the Mold" is about a family suffering from a mysterious illness.</li><li> "Deadly Curve" focuses on a car accident that killed three Secret Service agents in a motorcade escorting the Queen of England during a visit.</li><li> "Visibility Zero: Amtrak Sunset Limited Train Crash" focuses on a 1993 train crash in Alabama.</li><li> "Flashover: The 1987 Kings Cross Underground" focuses on a fire that killed several people at Kings Cross.</li><li> Not an entire episode, but there is about a minute and a half of one episode where the detectives (and victim's father) involved in the case recount trying to catch a suspect's cat to get a blood sample (the cat was white and white animal hair had been found with the victim) which is surprisingly light-hearted and even humorous for the show.</li><li> "Core Evidence" focuses on a batch of apple juice that was contaminated with E. coli.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerTitle">Spoiler Title</a>:<ul><li> One episode has Jenna Verhaalen's murder linked to three possible suspects; her boyfriend, a fellow neighbor, and a maintenance man working in her apartment. However, the episode's title is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Low Maintenance"</span>, practically giving away which of the three suspects was actually involved in the murder.</li><li> One episode focuses on a man who died from poisoning, and suspicion falls on one of his coworkers because that same type of poison is found in his workplace. However, the episode in question is entitled <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Til Death Do We Part"</span>, which kind of gives away that the real murderer is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man's wife.</span></li><li> One episode mentions the disappearance of a wife and infant son. The episode seems to toy with the possibility that her husband is the culprit, but given that the episode's title is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"A Woman Scorned"</span>, the viewer is likely waiting for the narrator to start talking about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the husband's ex-girlfriend</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>: As seen in both "Shopping Spree" and the eerily similar episode "A Woman Scorned". They each featured a mentally unhinged person stalking/becoming obsessed with the victim and killing them. However, the latter episode may also cross into this, as the murderer had a past relationship with the victim's husband and began stalking <em>her</em> after she told her to stop calling their home.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4jk3s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4jk3s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4jk3s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The cases are similar due to the fact that both women were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to their husbands who went missing while doing errands, they strongly resembled each other (beautiful, physically fit, of average height, long dark brown hair and around the same age), were with their babies when they were murdered (<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">and who also were murdered along with their mothers</a>), the cases happened within less than a year of each other and both lived in the state of Pennsylvania. In spite of the similarities, though, the cases are <em>not</em> connected.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>: "Head Games" concerns a killer who kidnaps his victim's wife, then promises to let her go if she tells the police that the victim's death was an accident. The show name-drops this, including the incident that was the trope namer, as the reason why she told two different versions of the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks">Stupid Crooks</a>: Sometimes, the killer's attempts to cover up their crime are jaw-dropping in their ineptness:<ul><li> In "Muffled Cries", Jason Funk used his victim's credit card to make a purchase. He then proceeded to sign his name, allowing police to trace the card to him.</li><li> In "Transaction Failed", the killer and his daughter didn't even bother to hide their identity when they withdraw money from the victim's bank account.</li><li> In "Shattered Innocence", the son told the 911 operator that his father's bedroom door was locked. He then went on to say that his father's bleeding from the mouth, something he couldn't possibly know unless he was already in there.</li><li> In "Frozen Assets", George Hansen tried to dispose of the evidence by tossing it into a river, only to have it hit the ice. As the victim's boyfriend noted, had he went a few steps further before throwing, the bag would've landed in open water and sunk.</li><li> In "Freeze Framed", Stacey Castor attempted to pin the murders of her husbands on her daughter Ashley by tricking her into overdosing on sleeping pills then writing a phony suicide note pinning the murders on her. Her plan backfired when detectives notice that "antifreeze" was misspelled as "antifree", the same pronunciation Stacey used in a police interview.</li><li> In "Smoke in Your Eyes", the killer apparently thought it was a good idea to light up a cigarette <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">while pouring gasoline through his victims' apartment</a></em>. Not only did he come close to killing himself, he also left his glasses at the scene, which later helped identify him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByTelevision">Taught by Television</a>:<ul><li> One episode features a woman who proved her incarcerated husband <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearTheirName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearTheirName">innocent</a> of a rape and murder, using a technique she saw on a previous episode of the show. On the downside, there was another woman who poisoned both of her husbands with antifreeze, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">and attempted to poison her daughter while trying to make it look like she was responsible</a>. She mentioned seeing an episode where a woman poisoned her first husband and common law husband with antifreeze.</li><li> It's not unusual for attorneys, detectives, or forensics experts interviewed on the show to mention previous episodes of the show as having helped them with a difficult case. In one case where a man faked his death in a fire so he could run off with his own life insurance money, the investigator figured out what was going on from watching an episode of the show where someone else did almost the exact same thing.</li><li> "Dinner and a Movie" had a woman who was found dead when the husband, who was away on a boating trip in the ocean, asked the neighbor to check up on her. She was originally estimated to have died when the husband was in the middle of an ocean and her husband was originally ruled out of killing her. However, police notice that the AC was on the highest setting in her room and found out that she died much earlier allowing her body to decay slower then normal, putting her husband at the scene of the crime. He learned the AC trick from watching a movie where the killer in the movie did the same thing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">Technically Living Zombie</a>: In "Family Ties", one of the victims briefly became this due the attack damaging his neocortex (which controls thought and reason) while leaving the paleocortex (which controls second-nature habits) intact. As a result, he was able to carry out his morning routine without realizing he'd been gravely wounded until he collapsed and died from blood loss.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethFlying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethFlying">Teeth Flying</a>: In "Purebread Murder", it's mentioned that the killer punched the victim hard enough to knock out some of her teeth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a>: "Within Arm's Reach" had a police officer accused of shooting his wife to death. While it appeared at first that he was guilty due to their collapsing marriage and his affair, she actually committed suicide and she set it up in a way where she was almost able to successfully frame him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: Most of the episode titles relate to a clue that leads to the arrest of a suspect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TilMurderDoUsPart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TilMurderDoUsPart">Til Murder Do Us Part</a>: A <em>huge</em> chunk of episodes, starting with the very first one, have featured people who were killed by their husband or wife for a variety of reasons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony">Unholy Matrimony</a>: Plenty of episodes showcase husbands and wives or boyfriends and girlfriends who commit murder together. One infamous episode, "Sign Here", had a man and his girlfriend team up to destroy a woman's life, first with psychological abuse and insults, then by ultimately kidnapping, murdering and <em>beheading</em> her. Most disturbingly, the woman was the man's <em>wife</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">The Unreveal</a>: For obvious reasons, some episodes do not reveal the name of a certain element that was crucial in committing the murder, such as one episode where a man killed his ex-wife after purchasing a book on how to commit a murder and get away with it or another where a young woman killed her father by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonIsEvil">poisoning him with a substance found in her high school chemistry class</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a>: Meta-example. There is a persistent rumor that the series was revived in 2016 for a 15th season and began airing new episodes. In actuality, the series did in fact end in 2011. HLN contributed to the confusion by advertising "all new" episodes, when in fact they were just episodes that hadn't aired on the channel. HLN would then, with full intents and purposes, prove the rumor true and indeed revive the series in 2020.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularSabotage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularSabotage">Vehicular Sabotage</a>: In "Sunday School Ambush", Brenda Andrew first attempts to kill her husband Robert by cutting the brake lines in his car, then making a call claiming to be in the hospital in the hopes that he would race to the hospital and get into a fatal accident. The plan fell apart when he discovered the sabotage before receiving the call.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion">Voice of the Legion</a>: In "Sealed with a Kiss", the person reading parts of the letters aloud early in the episode has a voice like this. They also read it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone">in a flat tone</a> which only serves to put even <em>more</em> emphasis on the fact that the identity of the person threatening Joanne Chambers is a total mystery. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It later turns out that the culprit was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Chambers herself</a>:</span><div class="indent"> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">???</a>:</strong> Chambers brought pot into school and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi">than</a> showed it in the faculty room just like it was a big joke.</div><div class="indent"> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">???</a>:</strong> I can get you in one try.

They may not think so, but I'm smarter than all of you, you stupid bitch.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope">Well, This Is Not That Trope</a>: The prosecutor in "Up in Smoke", a case where the forensics acquit the suspect, initially comes across as a bitter, arrogant jerk, so it's a surprise when he says of the defense's forensics team:<div class="indent">"In this business, you have people that, for a certain amount of money, will tell you anything you wanna hear. These experts were not of that ilk."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> In "Waste Mis-Management", police find a body they believe to be Glenda Furch, but further testing reveals it to be someone else. We never learn who this woman is or whether her death was ever solved.</li><li> In "Insulated Evidence", it's never stated who the anonymous tipster was that alerted cops to murderer Joe Luna. The only other person who was apparently aware of Luna's crime was his girlfriend, but it's never established that she was the one who placed the call, nor does it seem like the investigators ever asked her about it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow">Where Are They Now</a>: Reruns of the older episodes include an update that offers information on the perpetrators&mdash;if they've died in prison/been executed/been released, etc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldBeStupidEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldBeStupidEnough">Who Would Be Stupid Enough?</a>:<ul><li> When the investigators ran out of leads in "Muffled Cries," they checked the murder victim's credit card activity, but without much hope "since criminals are rarely that inept." Fortunately, this one was.</li><li> The killer's attempt to frame her ex-boyfriend in "The Letter" failed because of this; the detectives found it highly suspicious that the victim&#146;s son would drive up to the sheriff&#146;s office with the drug used to kill his mother right there in the truck.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Kids are not immune from being murdered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>:<ul><li> A British farmer reported numerous instances of harassment that were supposedly carried out by a neighbor with whom he'd had a dispute. This culminated in his wife being injured by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarBomb">Car Bomb</a>. Shortly after this, the neighbor came to the house and outright tried to kill him, forcing the farmer to kill him in self-defense. The investigation revealed that the whole thing was a set up. The man had been planning to kill his wife and created the incidents of harassment himself to establish a pattern and shift suspicion off himself. When the attempt at killing his wife failed, he invited the neighbor over to set up the fake attack to still try and lay the blame on him.</li><li> Averted but sadly played with. A guy knocked on a woman's door at 2 in the morning asking to use the phone, saying he ran out of gas and needed help. She knew better and told him not to come in and called the police. Sadly, he was living in the area at the time and was knocking on her door just so he could confirm that she was alone. He broke into the house later in the night after the police had left to rape and tried to murder her. By luck, she came out alive even though he stabbed her over 30 times.</li><li> Other episodes feature killers that deliberately harm themselves after committing the crime to make it look like they and the victim were both attacked by an unknown assailant.</li><li> Some wives who kill their husbands claim to have been the victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a>. The ex-girlfriend from "The Letter" claimed to have realized her ex had killed his mother and was afraid for her life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>: One episode featured a 13-year-old murder victim who looked much older and told people she was 19.</li></ul><hr>
