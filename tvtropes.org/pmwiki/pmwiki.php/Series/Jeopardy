Watson guessed Toronto (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The answer was Chicago; Midway International Airport is the one named for the battle, O'Hare International Airport is named for a pilot</span>). However, the programmers suggested that there were so many contextual ambiguities that Watson simply was confused: there are multiple cities in the U.S. also named Toronto, and Toronto in Canada has a baseball team that plays in the American MLB (the Toronto Blue Jays). In light of this, Trebek (a Canadian native) jokingly remarked that he learned that Toronto is now a U.S. city and one of the producers wore a Blue Jays jersey. Watson also placed a large number of question marks after this answer, which is apparently a gauge of how "unsure" it was about the answer. So the computer knew the answer was probably wrong, it just couldn't come up with anything better.</li><li> In the "Literary APB<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3digg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3digg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3digg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">All Points Bulletin</span>" category, the clue made it very obvious that it was looking for the main villain of the <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is Voldemort</span>?). Watson was stumped &#151; it figured out that it was being asked for a <em>Harry Potter</em> character, but because it wasn't putting much weight on category name and didn't seem to make the connection that the police only issues APBs for criminals, it couldn't figure out <em>which</em> character it was being asked for.</li><li> The "Also on your computer keys" category tripped Watson up really badly.

Pat has since provided a few video clues, and he came full circle in 2010 by competing in two more celebrity games, winning the first with <em>$55,300</em>!</li><li> In 2011, sports anchor and radio host Dan Patrick introduced the clues for two full sports-centric categories, and has also provided scattered video clues as early as 2005.

She didn't advance to the finals though, which were won by Canada's Michael Daunt, a 1996 TOC finalist.</li><li> After 5 day champion Barbara Lowe's removal from the 1986 Tournament of Champions field for violating contestant eligibility requirements, 4 day champion Gary Palmer made the tournament in her place, despite winning just $18,400, a record low for a TOC qualifier (even when adjusted for inflation). He had a good run though, giving eventual finalist Marvin Shinkman a late challenge in the semifinals.</li><li> As 2001 College Champion Vinita Kailasanath was unable to attend the next Tournament of Champions in 2003 due to final exams occurring during tapings, her spot instead went to 4 day champion Kathy Cassity, making her the first ever TOC qualifier from Hawaii.

Of those four, only Berman won his first round game, though he eventually lost in the next round. It helped that Steve Berman had been a finalist in his Tournament of Champions, as well.</li><li> As 74 day champion Ken Jennings gave up his place in the 2006 Tournament of Champions in lieu of the finals bye in 2005's Ultimate Tournament of Champions, his spot in the 2006 TOC went to 3 day champion Aaron Thompson, who won just $57,899 in his reign. He had a good run, leading for long stretches of Double Jeopardy! in his two games, and advancing to the semifinals as a wild card, but he was eliminated there by eventual finalist Vik Vaz.</li><li> Similarly to Vinita Kailasanath a few years prior, 2008 College Champion Joey Beachum couldn't attend 2009's TOC due to military obligations, with his spot going to 4 day champion Deborah Fitzgerald in what would be the first Tournament of Champions with <em>no</em> regular annual tournament winners since the show introduced them in 1987. Joey would compete in 2010's TOC, which uniquely featured <em>three</em> College Champions.</li><li> Due to 5 day champion Jerry Slowik's legal issues, he was replaced in the 2014 Tournament of Champions by 4 day champion Mark Japinga, becoming the only regular play competitor in the field who hadn't won at least 5 games.

Notably, Bruce Seymour (who won the $250,000 <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> top prize) wasn't considered the modern show's all-time winnings leader (Chuck Forrest, Bob Blake, and Robin Carroll instead led in winnings before Brad Rutter took the record on any level in 2002), and as Seymour was only a four day champion and Tournament of Champions quarterfinalist in regular play, he has never been invited back for later reunion tournaments.</li><li> 1998's "Battle of the Bay Area Brains" episode is also not canon for past contestant winnings, likely as it was a charity game that only aired in the San Francisco market.

For example, "Before &amp; After" was a recurring <em>Wheel</em> category before it was adopted for <em>Jeopardy!</em>, and "Rhyme Time" was a <em>Jeopardy!</em> category long before it was adopted for <em>Wheel</em>.

Andy would end up with <em>$68,000</em>, among the best one day scores on <em>any</em> episode of <em>Jeopardy</em>, thus meaning that the comedian beat the everloving crap out of the journalist.</li><li> The majority of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter's games were these, which helps explain why they've won millions of dollars through the show and related tournaments. Good examples for each would include Ken's 38th win from July 2004 (where he won a then record <em>$75,000</em>), and Brad's 2001 TOC quarterfinal game (which he dominated from beginning to end, finishing with $18,000, or $36,000 in today's values)</li><li> Thanks to jumping across categories, hunting for Daily Doubles in the higher dollar amounts from the bottom up, and often going all in on Daily Doubles, notable Jeopardy! contestants like Roger Craig, Alex Jacob, and Arthur Chu made a habit of curb stomping contestants during their runs on the show.

Ken Jennings ($4,800) and Brad Rutter ($10,400), Jeopardy's two most successful players, weren't even as close as the score made it seem &mdash; they both doubled up in Final Jeopardy.</li><li> In the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3599">March 16, 2011<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> game, eventual 5 day champion Tom Kunzen absolutely <em>owned</em> his opponents who struggled to even remain on the plus side: the scores at the end of DJ! were $29,200 for Tom and -$3,600 and -$1,400 for his opponents respectively, leading to only the fifth (at least) single-player Final Jeopardy! in the Trebek era.</li><li> The 2015 Tournament Of Champions turned into this for 6 day champion Alex Jacob at every stage. He doubled up his opponents in all four games, largely prevented 5 day champ Brennan Bushee from ringing in <em>at all</em> in the <em>Jeopardy!</em> round in the semifinals, and pulled off 3 all-in Daily Doubles in the finals to help lock out no less than Matt Jackson and Kerry Greene. When all was said and done, he was guaranteed to win by over $30,000 in the finals no matter what either opponent wagered, and Alex Trebek referred to Jacob's performance as "the most dominant performance by anyone in any of our tournaments."</li><li> Harking back to the original NBC version, one of the era's most biggest winners was Burns Cameron, who won a record $11,000 during his five-day romp. In one game, he played against two contestants who were said to be inebriated during their show; they were so drunk they struggled to even press the lock-out buzzer (leading Cameron to at times intentionally delay ringing in to give his opponents a chance to answer). Unsurprisingly, he was the only one around for "Final Jeopardy!" (This was at a time when the values went $10 to $50 in the Jeopardy round, which means that after adjusting for the change in clue values, his five-day score actually <em>beats</em> that of Frank Spangenberg.)</li><li> James Holzhauer in the spring of 2019. Thanks to his background as a professional gambler, his gameplay was dominated by playing the higher-value clues first, seeking out Daily Doubles, and wagering aggressively. As a result, most of his games were blowouts. Of his 32 wins, only four saw the second place contestant finish within $30,000 of Holzhauer. The closest call was in Holzhauer's 18th game, when he beat Adam Levin by only $18. Four of Holzhauer's wins were by more than $100,000 <em>over the second place contestant</em>. He also blew past the previous one-day winnings records (Roger Craig's $77,000 mark from 2010) no fewer than <em>ten</em> times (Holzhauer's score of $89,229 from May 20, 2019, is the tenth-highest single-day score in the show's history).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory">Dark Horse Victory</a>:<ul><li> December, 1984, 5 day champion Jerry Frankel was the second lowest earner in the inaugural 1985 TOC field, and only advanced to the semifinals as a wild card after finishing in third place in his opening game. Then, he beat two of season 1's top four earners (Ron Black and the top-ranked Paul Boymel) in a runaway in the semifinals, and won a competitive final round to become the show's first ever TOC winner, and the show's biggest overall cash winner at the time.</li><li> Going into the finals of 1990's <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> tournament, Bob Verini was the understandable favourite, having won the 1987 Tournament of Champions, and having defeated fellow <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> finalist Dave Traini in the 1987 finals too. However, both were upset by Bruce Seymour, a <em>4</em> day champion who didn't make it out of the 1988 TOC quarterfinals, and who hasn't been invited to any reunion tournaments since.</li><li> 1994's Tournament of Champions' top three earners were Steve Chernicoff and John Cuthbertson (future standouts of 2005's Ultimate TOC) and Amy Fine (the winningest woman in regular play of the pre-doubled era), but Fine was eliminated in the quarterfinals, and Cuthbertson and Chernicoff were upset in the semifinals by College Champion Jeff Stewart. The finals that year would see Stewart square off with 4 day champions Rachael Schwartz and David Hillinck (the first time that the TOC didn't have at least one 5-time champion in the finals), the lowest earners to qualify for that TOC, and who had both lost to Cuthbertson in the quarterfinals. When all was said and done, Schwartz edged out Stewart by $1 to become the first woman and 4 day champ to win a TOC.</li><li> The obvious favourite in the 2004 Tournament of Champions was Tom Walsh, the show's first ever 7 day champion, but he fell in a finals upset to Russ Schumacher, who was the lowest earning 4 day champion in the field, had only gotten seven clues right in his quarterfinal loss, and was in a $10,100 hole going into the second game of the finals. However, he proved his TOC win was no fluke by making the Battle of the Decades semifinals a decade later.<ul><li> In the same tournament, Tom Baker became the first 3 day champion to ever win a Tournament of Champions game when he defeated the aforementioned Russ Schumacher and eventual Ultimate TOC semifinalist Chris Miller in a quarterfinal runaway. Arguably, any 3-time champion that wins in a TOC can be seen in this light, especially given that they didn't run as long or win as much as their opponents in the field, as later seen with Michael Falk, Vik Vaz, and Doug Hicton's TOC final runs.</li></ul></li><li> The 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions was littered with upsets and dark horse victories in the early rounds. Of the "Nifty Nine" champions that were byed to the second round following their record setting and accomplished prior runs on the show, <em>seven</em> of them lost their opening game, with only Brad Rutter and Frank Spangenberg advancing to the quarterfinals (and only one other TOC winner, Dan Melia, joining them there). On the flip side, the UTOC was a great showcase for John Cuthbertson, Chris Miller, and Pam Mueller, who won their own share of upsets on their route to the semifinals, after ending their previous <em>Jeopardy!</em> runs as semifinalists in their regular TOCs. Cuthbertson, in particular, impressed many by knocking off TOC winners Bob Verini and Bob Blake, plus TOC finalist Tad Carithers in the first two rounds alone, and got very close to defeating Rutter himself during the Round 4 semifinals.</li><li> In the 2006 Tournament of Champions, 6+ day champions David Madden, Tom Kavanaugh, and Kevin Marshall were understandable favorites to take the $250,000 top prize, only for all to fall in the opening rounds at the hands of 4 day champion Bill Macdonald... and all in runaway fashion, no less! However, Bill's Cinderella run met its end in the finals at the hands of two even bigger underdogs: 3 day champions Vik Vaz (who had ended Bill's regular reign the previous year) and eventual winner Michael Falk, who rallied from Vik's $13,400 lead after the first day to become the only 3 day champion to win a TOC.</li><li> Much of the chatter surrounding the 2014 Tournament of Champions finals revolved around who'd win between 20 day champion Julia Collins and 11 day champion Arthur Chu (far and away the top winners of season 30), but both lost in the finals to 8 day champion Ben Ingram after he opened up a $10,000 lead going into day 2. Ben was the biggest winner of season 29, and the fourth highest earning qualifier in the field, but anyone in that TOC would have been a dark horse against the Julia/Arthur pairing.</li><li> As hard to believe as it is, Brad Rutter was once a dark horse. He was only the 9th highest earner in the 2001 TOC field, but he proved himself on the big stage by defeating the field's biggest winner (Doug Lach, who won over $30,000 more than Brad) in a runaway in the quarterfinals. The rest is history.</li><li> Any defeat of a lengthy, seemingly unstoppable <em>Jeopardy!</em> champion could be considered this, particularly Nancy Zerg's defeat of Ken Jennings in his 75th game in November 2004. Averted when said champion loses to someone who goes on a long reign of their own, like when 9 day champion Jason Keller lost to eventual 6 day champion Dave Leach in December 2011.</li><li> The 1991 Tournament of Champions was notable for being the first time that all 3 finalists, Jim Scott (the eventual winner), Steve Robin, and Lou Pryor, were wildcard semifinalists. Jim Scott and Steve Robin both lost to Mark Born (season 7's top winner) in the quarterfinals, who was defeated by Lou Pryor in the semifinals. Lou, in turn, lost to Leslie Frates in the quarterfinals, who was defeated by Jim in the semifinals.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: Who is Alex Trebek?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a>: A True Daily Double (or close to it) in Double Jeopardy!, which was Roger Craig's signature strategy. Get it right, and you double your score, potentially securing victory or denying an opponent a lock-win.

A miss on either would have likely cost him the game, especially as he missed <em>Final</em>.</li><li> Three of Isaac Segal's opponents in July 1995 did this.<ul><li> July 5, 1995: Dan Schay was a very distant third when he wagered his entire $2,500. He would end up taking the lead from Isaac going into Final Jeopardy.</li><li> July 6, 1995: James Greenberg wagered his entire $2,900, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">saying "I'm a gambling man, let's bet it all" beforehand</a>. He (briefly) narrowed the gap Isaac had throughout much of the game.</li><li> July 7, 1995: Beverly Adams entered Double Jeopardy leading over Isaac, who hurriedly retook the lead when she uncovered one of the DDs. She wagered $3,000 of her $5,200, but got it wrong. After recovering to $3,200, she found the second DD, and wagered $3,000 again, but missed it too. That, along with another incorrect answer, threw her into negative score territory which she was unable to get out of before time ran out.</li></ul></li><li> Happened in two of 4 day champion Barbara Walker's games in January 1996:<ul><li> Barbara herself did this in her second game. She found the second Daily Double at the end of Double Jeopardy! and wagered $4,500 of her $4,900. She got it right, putting her in second place with only $1,200 separating her from the then-first place player.</li><li> Done by one of her opponents in her fourth. Nick Lamelza had $4,800 when he hit the second Daily Double at the end of Double Jeopardy!, with Barbara at $10,400 and the other player John Zappacosta at $9,100. He risked $4,000 but got it wrong, leaving him with only $800 for Final.</li></ul></li><li> June 25, 1996: Karl Coryat was victimized by one of his opponents doing this on his third game. Don Sloan found the second Daily Double on the second to last clue of Double Jeopardy! and got it right after wagering $4,800 of his $5,200. Karl lost his lock going into Final and eventually the game.</li><li> During a semifinal in 2001's last International Tournament, Swedish champion Fredrik Gildea wagered all of his $9,500 on the last Daily Double, in what is the biggest <em>true</em> Daily Double in recorded <em>Jeopardy!</em> history when adjusted for inflation. However, he couldn't repeat the same magic in the finals, as eventual winner Robin Carroll landed <em>five</em> of the Daily Doubles in the two day affair, and Fredrik didn't find the other.</li><li> Bob Verini finished the first game of the Million Dollar Masters finals $5,000 behind Brad Rutter, and he was trailing Brad by $2,000 in Game 2 when he found the second Daily Double late in Double Jeopardy! Bob wagered all $10,400 to cheers and applause in the audience... but he wound up being completely stumped by the clue. The audience gasped as he went down to zero, and then they gave him sympathetic applause. Bob still was able to play Final Jeopardy! after ringing in on the last clue and getting it right.</li><li> 2011 7 day champion Joon Pahk made expert use of this during his run, becoming the only recorded <em>Jeopardy!</em> contestant to wager at least $14,000 on Daily Doubles <em>twice</em>. Both of the wagers were in math categories, and Joon is a college physics teacher, hence his eagerness to go big when the opportunity arose.</li><li> In arguably the costliest true Daily Double in <em>Jeopardy!</em> history, June 2012 contestant Terry Kent (who was in second place by $400) wagered <em>all</em> of his then-$13,600 in an attempt to take the lead in Double Jeopardy. However, he misunderstood the clue (which asked for a Mohs scale-listed element that <em>ended</em> in Z; he responded with "zirconia"), dropping him to $0 and knocking him out of Final. He made up for it though as a <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> contestant in the fall of 2016, becoming a 3 day champion, and surviving an all-in Daily Double miss in this third game with a major comeback.</li><li> Though overshadowed by his Final response ("What is someone in Normandy, but I just won $75,000!"), 2013 Teen Tournament champion Leonard Cooper employed this in the deciding second game of the finals, wagering <em>$18,000</em> of his then-$18,200 on the last Daily Double to take a huge (though, despite his Final response, not insurmountable) lead.</li><li> 2016 3 day champion Philip Tiu relied on this during his reign, especially as he visibly struggled with the buzzer and was often slow to ring in and respond. Bold Daily Double wagers, including a then-record bet of <em>$19,000</em> in his second game, helped net Philip over $96,000 in just three days, but a wrong response on an all-in wager in his fourth game helped end his run.</li><li> A death-or-glory attack may also appear in Final Jeopardy!, particularly if a contestant with a comfortable or runaway lead wagers an excessively large amount, which would net them a huge score if they're right, and cost them the win if they're wrong. 2015 5 day champion and TOC semifinalist Dan Feitel (who often wagered all but $1 if he led going into Final without a lock) is a notable recent example, but other examples include 2012 Teen Tournament winner Elyse Mancuso and 2013 Kids Week standout Skyler Hornbeck, who each wagered almost everything in Final despite having first place locked up, and would have needlessly gave the victory away had they missed.</li><li> Occasionally, a Celebrity Jeopardy! player in first place will bet it all in Final Jeopardy!, which would obviously net them more money for their charities, and put them at $0 if they're wrong, but you could justify the unsafe wager as they'll still get at least $10,000 for their charity. Andy Richter and Jon Stewart both gambled their whole $11,000+ winnings in 1999 (on consecutive days, no less) despite each having locks. The same didn't work out for author Tom Clancy, who only needed a $1,401 wager or an incorrect reply from Catherine Crier to win his Power Players Week game in 1997, and while she was wrong, he wagered everything, handing the game to Tim Russert (who had been in a distant third place).</li><li> Going True Daily Double during a commanding lead was also a signature move of 2019 champion James Holzhauer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship">Defeat Equals Friendship</a>: Many champions and contestants who have played against each other have become friends over the years. Further reinforced by games in reunion tournaments, where Alex and the contestants - most well acquainted from prior events - chat on old times.<ul><li> Sometimes inverted when some winners film their episodes in the same taping sessions, especially pre-2003. For example, 1996 5-time champions David Sampugnaro and Michael Dupee had their shows filmed almost back-to-back (David's encompassed one week, while Michael got 4 out of 5 shows of the next week).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayedReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayedReaction">Delayed Reaction</a>: The doubling of cash amounts in November 2001 would in theory mean that most cash records on <em>Jeopardy!</em> would be toppled quickly, but it took 4 months for Jerome Vered's then-one day record of $34,000 to be toppled, and Frank Spangenberg's then-5 day winnings record of $102,597 actually held up until April <em>2003</em> during Brian Weikle's 5 day reign.[[labelnote:note]]Spangenberg's record when adjusted for the doubling of the clue values held up until 2019; James Holzhauer topped the equivalent performance in four days.[[/note]]<ul><li> The removal of 5 game winning limits would seemingly have ensured that 6+ day superchampions would become routine Tournament of Champions winners, but not so. It took until 2009 for a superchamp to win it all (9 day champion Dan Pawson), and it wasn't until 2014 that all three TOC finalists were 6+ game winners. Of 9 TOC finals since 2004, only 13 of 27 finalists won more than 5 games, and only four of them (Pawson, Roger Craig, Ben Ingram, and Alex Jacob) won first place.</li><li> In addition, despite the first two 10+ game-winning champions (Ken Jennings and David Madden) starting only about a year apart in 2004-05 shortly after the 5-game winning limit was lifted, it wasn't until 2014 that 10+ game-winning champions began occurring about once a year and it took until 2019 for one of them (James Holzhauer) to win a Tournament of Champions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">Department of Redundancy Department</a>:<ul><li> The name of a category on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3495">November 3, 2010<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, where each correct response contained or completed a phrase with the same word twice.</li><li> July 17, 2013: Jimmy McGuire of the clue crew announced "Vietnamese Water Puppets&mdash;The Water Puppets of Vietnam" as one of the category titles.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a>:<ul><li> The Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy! can turn into this if a contestant is trailing first place by a large amount, forcing them into a huge wager to attempt to at least get back in contention.

Overall, this has happened in the Trebek era at least eight times (most recently in January 2016). It's uncertain how many times this occurred in the Fleming era, but on one episode he hosted, all three contestants finished <em>Double Jeopardy!</em> with no money, so Fleming spent the rest of the show chatting with the contestants. If this scenario were to happen today, the show's website implied that they may play the Final Jeopardy! clue just for fun.</li><li> In the inaugural season of the current version, all three players ended Final Jeopardy! with scores of $0 in <em>two</em> different games after giving an incorrect answer and wagering everything. The first time was on the Trebek version's <em>second episode</em>, with all three giving the same incorrect day the 20th Century began &#151; all three responded with "January 1, 1900", but the correct response was January 1, 190<em>1</em>. It happened again on April 8, 1985 when all three contestants missed a <em>Final</em> response on the date that college football bowl games took place.</li><li> This happened for the first time in a tournament setting during the 1991 Seniors Tournament. During the second quarterfinal game, all 3 players were incorrect in Final Jeopardy!, with all 3 wagering everything. As a result, a fifth wild card position was added to round out the semifinals, the only time to date that there were only 4 automatic semifinalists in a <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournament.<ul><li> More famously, during the second semifinal game of the 2013 Teen Tournament, all 3 players had the same incorrect response on all-in wagers in Final, thus no player won. As the tournament finals needed three contestants, the third spot went to the highest scoring runner-up in the semifinals (Leonard Cooper, who ended up winning the tournament), though that rule has since been changed.</li></ul></li><li> Triple-zero finishes have occurred in two Celebrity Jeopardy! games when each missed Final Jeopardy! and went all in. The first was a 1996 game between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz">Jon Lovitz</a>, Carl Lewis, and Matthew Fox, while a 1998 "Ladies Night" game between Jane Curtin, Teri Garr, and Naomi Judd saw the same finish. For the former, all three contestants received the $10,000 runner-up prize for their charity, but producers changed the rules afterward so the leader after Double Jeopardy! would win the game if a triple-zero happened again in a celebrity game. As a result, Jane Curtin was the credited winner of the 1998 game, winning the $15,000 top prize for her charity.</li><li> The electronic pens used to write down Final Jeopardy! responses shut off when the last note of the think music plays. The show rules against contestants if their responses are cut off by the time limit. One episode had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> as the correct response, and a contestant was denied credit for "Who is Clint Eastwoo".</li><li> If a challenger wins the game with a score less than $1,000, he/she ends up taking home the least money of all three contestants for that day's game, but at least they get to come back for a second episode.</li><li> November 19, 1992: The first Final game in the 1992 Tournament of Champions between Jerome Vered, Leszek Pawlowicz, and Bruce Simmons was a very fast-paced affair, and the three players entered Final Jeopardy accumulating $25,400 as a group (pre-doubled, no less). Unfortunately, they all missed the Final Jeopardy! answer, and they cumulatively lost $20,700.</li><li> A rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> example on June 3, 2002. Four-time champion Jill Bunzendahl Chimka said that if she won five games, she'd give the car she won to her son, Cory. Unfortunately in her fifth game, she finished Double Jeopardy! dead last and didn't know the answer to the Final Jeopardy! clue. She wrote "What is Sorry Cory No Jag?" to the amusement of Alex and the audience.</li><li> In a tournament wide variant, the 2003 Tournament of Champions saw <em>eight</em> of the ten losing quarterfinalists finish with no money (six wagered everything in Final Jeopardy! and were incorrect, while two finished Double Jeopardy! in the red). As four wild cards are needed for the semifinals, the six-way tie at $0 was broken by which two contestants had the highest post-Double Jeopardy! scores in their games, with Eric Floyd (an eventual finalist that year) and Max Levaren advancing as a result. This was especially unlucky for Mark Lee, whose score after Double Jeopardy! was just <em>$200</em> less than Max's score. As well, Travis Troyer's quarterfinal score of $2,599 was good for the third lowest by a wild card semifinalist in TOC history if adjusted for inflation, behind only Floyd and Levaren.</li><li> November 19, 2008: A semifinal match of that season's Teen Tournament had Anne Frank as the correct response to a Final Jeopardy! clue. Going into Final, Karan and Sarah were tied for the lead with third place player Anurag only $1,200 behind. Sarah got the correct response but didn't wager enough to cover Anurag. Karan wrote "Who is Ann<strong>i</strong>e Frank?" which initiated a stopdown for the staff to check his answer. When taping resumed nearly 30 minutes later, Alex said that they could not give him credit because their research library found no reference to Anne ever being called that. To make matters worse for both Karan and Sarah, Anurag went onto win the tournament.</li><li> After an impressive 6 day championship reign by Cindy Stowell in December 2016 (becoming the first female 4+ day champion in <em>20 months</em>), her loss concluded with an epilogue by Alex Trebek, where he announced that Cindy was battling stage IV colon cancer during her taping dates, and had passed away on December 5th - eight days <em>before</em> her first game aired. This wasn't shocking news for most, given how the story spread online, but it's no less sad. Her winnings from her run were donated to a cancer research charity; her estate was later given another $10,000 by the show ($5,000 of which would have been her guaranteed prize money had she lived to be in the Tournament of Champions, the other $5,000 being a donation) and this also went to the charity. During the 2016 Tournament of Champions, Alex and all 15 contestants wore dark blue ribbons for colon cancer awareness in Cindy's memory.</li><li> November 10, 2017: In that year's Tournament of Champions, the Final Jeopardy! clue asked for the contestants to identify the George Cross. Quarterfinalist Justin Vossler lost out on a wild card spot when his response of "What is the George<strong>&#146;s</strong> Cross?" was ruled unacceptable due to it not being a possessive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">Down to the Last Play</a>: Unless there's a runaway leader that can't be caught, Final Jeopardy! is this by design.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSpotlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSpotlight">Dramatic Spotlight</a>: Used during the Final Jeopardy! Round (ever since Season 7, and is still used to this day).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a>: At the beginning of the episode airing 11-9-2020, producer Mike Richards, in his comments at the beginning of the show, noted that there were 35 episodes that had not yet been aired at the time of Trebek's passing, and that it was Trebek's wish that they be aired as-is. After Richards closed his remarks with a somber "This is <em>Jeopardy!</em>", the entire set darkened.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>:<ul><li> The first episodes in 1964 had a slightly different board (with the category titles located above <em>and below</em> the dollar amounts) and different contestant podiums (the score displays were directly in the middle, while the nameplates were on top). By mid-1965, the lower category displays had been removed and the contestant podiums reworked into the form used for the rest of the run. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>, below.</li><li> The first Trebek season, for that matter. Just like the Fleming version, contestants could ring in as soon as the clue was revealed; Alex would often add chatter about each clue; and of course, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesSpiel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesSpiel">Rules Spiel</a> before each round. It's been said that not one game in the first season saw all 61 clues played. As well, there were no on screen graphics listing contestant names during the introduction.</li><li> Early on, the Daily Double sound effect on the Trebek version was a "sweeping" sound on a synthesizer, somewhat like a baby version of the THX "deep note". After about a month, the sound effect was changed to the electronic "trill" still used to this day.</li><li> There seemed to be more of an attempt to incite drama in the early Alex Trebek episodes, as there were often canned gasps after incorrect or missed questions. Trebek would also "caution [the players] about the jeopardy" &mdash; namely, that they would lose money for incorrect questions &mdash; and tell them that they were "out of jeopardy" at the end of each round. These dramatics were quickly dropped.</li><li> The shots of the clues would rotate between the now-familiar full-screen zoom of the text and an actual shot of the monitor where the text was displayed. Eventually the latter was phased out. Relatedly, Daily Doubles would originally show a still shot of the monitor with the Daily Double logo flashing within, cut to the contestant as he or she wagered, then cut back to the monitor to show the clue. By Season 2, the clue text began to be superimposed on a shot of the contestant after the wager, and by 1986, the Daily Double logo began "flying" out of the monitor as the clues do.</li><li> Season 2 began in September 1985 by placing the defending champions in the <em>third</em> podium at the far right, and introducing them first in an episode. This experiment only lasted one week before moving back to the first podium at the left.</li><li> The original 1985 Tournament of Champions quarterfinals saw contestants grouped together in games in chronological order by when their original run on the show was (resulting in one game featuring two contestants named Paul). Starting the next year, <em>Jeopardy!</em> ignored chronological order when selecting quarterfinal matchups.</li><li> Competition wise, <em>Jeopardy!</em>'s first two seasons are seen by many fans as lacking in "great" champions and the common gameplay strategies and preparation that most notable champions have since utilized. No one from the inaugural 1984-85 season has <em>ever</em> won a game in a later reunion tournament, and from season 2, the only contestant to do so is 1986 TOC winner Chuck Forrest, who is often considered the modern show's first great player. In fact, six of the nine lowest earning TOC qualifiers in history came from season 2.</li><li> For the first 11 seasons, <em>Jeopardy!</em> rigidly scheduled their annual tournaments in the same sweeps period month each year, with the Tournament of Champions in November (later preceded by a week of Celebrity games), the Teen Tournament in February, the College Championship in May, and the Seniors Tournament ending the season in July (and previously airing in May before the College Championship was introduced). Starting in season 12, tournaments were moved to a fluid scheduling pattern, though with the exception of the December 1995 Seniors Tournament, and the September 2004 and March 2009 ToCs, they are still held at least partially in the aforementioned sweeps periods.<ul><li> As well, the Tournament of Champions ran for its first 9 installments (1985-1993) as an annual November event with the entire previous season being the qualifying period for it. Starting in the 1993-1994 season, the qualifying periods changed to all games between tournaments.</li></ul></li><li> From January 1998 until April 1999, <em>Jeopardy!</em> held nine one-off Celebrity Jeopardy! games that weren't scheduled as part of a week of celebrity episodes, though the last four were scheduled on consecutive Mondays. These episodes featured themed contestant groupings and names (i.e. Sitcom Stars Night, Olympians Night, and so on). One-off celebrity episodes were largely retired afterwards, save for one in March 2009 (as a precursor to that year's Tournament of Champions in Las Vegas) and the quarterfinals of the next season's Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational Tournament (which were scattered throughout the season before the final rounds aired in May).</li><li> Though <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> and Power Players Week contestants typically get $1,000 to play with in <em>Final Jeopardy!</em> if they finish with no money, the amounts varied prior to 2009 for scores below $0. Many celebrities with negative totals basically had the minus removed from their negative post-Double score (effectively multiplying it by -1), but there are recorded games prior to 2009 where celebrities with negative money were spotted even less (i.e. $500, $100), possibly depending on how the game itself went.</li><li> Though only in its third season, <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> differed in its first season by not having returning champions. As a result, the chase to get into the season-ending two day championships saw contestants making high and risky wagers to rack up points in order to try and qualify. Now, returning champions are in full effect, with victories gaining precedence over accumulated points.</li><li> Seasons 1-8 (1984-92) had contestant interviews held after the first commercial break and the Jeopardy! round wrapped up afterwards. However, from seasons 9 through 12 (1992-96), the Jeopardy! round would be completed immediately following the first break and the interviews took place afterwards. Season 13 (1996-97) switched them back to where they've been since.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: On February 4, 1994, Tom Nichols was in his 5th game, but lost due to an incorrect Final Jeopardy answer. Several months later, it was determined that there was a "clue discrepancy" and he was correct after all, and he was invited back on October 10, 1994 to try again for his 5th victory.

One such clue referenced a clue that called the St. Louis <em>Globe-Democrat</em> a defunct newspaper, saying that the paper was re-established by the time the episode aired. However, by the time they aired the episode with the correction, the paper went under again!</li><li> October 30, 1992: The last day of the first <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> week saw arguably the worst Celebrity game in <em>Jeopardy</em> history. Only 43 clues were revealed, and <em>10</em> of them were triple stumpers. Both Robert Guillaume and Ed Begley Jr. finished Double Jeopardy! with <em>8</em> incorrect responses each, with Begley Jr. only exceeding $500 <em>once</em>, and finishing with -$1,100. Rosie O'Donnell held the lead going into Final Jeopardy! with a whopping <em>$2,000</em> (largely as she didn't guess as freely as her opponents), though she didn't ring in for most of Double Jeopardy!, and told Alex that she didn't know the question on four occasions where she didn't ring in. At least everyone got <em>Final</em> right, and 2 of the 3 Daily Doubles were successfully converted.</li><li> November 8, 1995: Miss America winner Shawntel Smith doesn't manage a positive score through an entire <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> game. She rings in only four times in the Jeopardy! round and is virtually unheard from in Double Jeopardy!, leaving her score of -$500 unchanged for its duration.</li><li> November 13-15, 1996: The latter three games of <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> week. Neither player finished the game exceeding the $10,000 then-minimum prize, including the aformentioned triple-zero ending from the 13th. This forced the producers to change the rules regarding the house minimum on celebrity games.<ul><li> November 14 was particularly dreadful. <em>35</em> correct responses overall, with astronaut Buzz Aldrin entering Final Jeopardy! with just $4,200, Brett Butler with nothing after losing all of her money on two incorrect True Daily Doubles in Double Jeopardy!, and Eartha Kitt ending with <em>-$2,500</em>, never getting above <em>$300</em> during the entire game. Brett managed to come back to win in Final Jeopardy! with a single get (as contestants with no money typically get $1,000 for Final, Eartha missed, and Buzz wagered all but $1,200 of his winnings on an incorrect response).</li></ul></li><li> April 30, 1997: Poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstenDunst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstenDunst">Kirsten Dunst</a> rang in on only four clues throughout an entire <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> game, including <em>once</em> in the Jeopardy! round.

Since she entered Final in the red, she was spotted $1,000 to play with... and proceeded to lose that as well. What makes it worse is one of her opponents, Benjamin Salisbury, won the game with $1.</li><li> June 12, 1998: A two-player Final Jeopardy! with the players both tied at $7,600 showed the pitfalls of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>". Neither of them trusted the other to wager $0 and tie, so they both wagered everything&#133; and both got it wrong.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1626">October 12, 1999<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had 15 out of 28 clues in Double Jeopardy! stump the players, <em>three</em> of which are in the top boxes.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1001">October 15, 2001<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> show, which turned into such a bloodbath in Double Jeopardy! that all three players emerged with lower scores than they started &#151; from $1,000/$2,800/$1,900 to $800/$2,000/-$100. On top of that, the remaining players failed Final Jeopardy! as well and lost more money (Even worse, all three Daily Doubles were answered correctly).</li><li> May 9, 2002: Going into Final Jeopardy! in the semifinals of the Million Dollar Masters tournament, Leslie Frates held an $800 lead over Brad Rutter, largely after wagering $9,000 of her then-$9,400 on her correct Daily Double. Everyone got Final right, with Brad wagering all of his $19,600, but despite her near-true Daily Double, Leslie wagered <em>nothing</em>, likely gambling that Brad would miss (Leslie immediately lampshaded her wager by asking Alex "Can I change it?") Standing pat rather than going for the $18,801 lockout wager cost Leslie a shot at the $1,000,000 top prize and a second reunion tournament finals slot, while Brad went on to win his first of three reunion tournaments a few days later.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1361">May 16, 2003<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: The second day of the 2003 Tournament of Champions finals saw all three finalists answer Final Jeopardy! correctly. Brian Weikle, who led going into Final, wagered $19,601 to cover Mark Dawson's score if he doubled up, which Mark did. The problem? Brian needed to wager $19,<em>801</em> to cover Mark, a $200 math error that cost him first place and over $193,000.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=163">February 23, 2005.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> To elaborate:<ul><li> 24 clues stumped all three players: 8 in the Jeopardy! Round and 16 in Double Jeopardy!, including the entire aforementioned "Quotable Oscar Hosts" category. All three Daily Doubles were bombed as well. That's <em>45% of the entire game</em>.</li><li> 2002 Teen Tournament winner Bernard Holloway managed to get only five right answers, and four <em>wrong</em> answers (including two of the Daily Doubles). He finished the Jeopardy! Round with $200, but fell back into the red on the fourth clue of Double Jeopardy! and never got back out.</li><li> The game became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> with one whole category left: the middle contestant also knocked himself out with two straight wrong answers, and nobody gave a right response for the next <em>five</em> clues.</li><li> The last clue on the board was a Daily Double, which went to the only contestant who still had money, 1988 5 day champion Jeff Richmond; he wagered $1,000 and got it wrong. Since he was the only one with money, he was also the only one around for Final Jeopardy! Luckily, he gave a right answer there and kept all but $300 of his $11,800. Keep in mind this was the <em>Ultimate Tournament of Champions</em>. Then again, by virtue of winning, he was assured the minimum for the game and a spot in the next round. No contestant who made it to the second round left with less than $25,000.</li></ul></li><li> September 17, 2009: In the inaurugral quarterfinal match of that season's <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> tournament, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN">Wolf Blitzer</a> finishes Double Jeopardy! with, among celebrity and Power Players contestants, a record low score (unadjusted) of -$4,600.

Her response was deemed to be incorrect, costing her $3800, making her score $10,000. Had she not made that mistake, she would have had $17,600 and would have been among the four wild-card qualifiers for the semi-finals.</li><li> On <a class="urllink" href="http://j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=4074">February 7, 2013<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the second of three semifinal matches in the Teen Tournament, not only did all three contestants give <em>the same</em> incorrect response in Final Jeopardy!, but all three contestants bet their <em>entire earnings</em> as well, meaning none of the three contestants advanced to the finals. Jeopardy! actually changed the rules regarding finishes in tournaments to prevent this from happening again, as it's unfair to other contestants who wouldn't know there'd be a triple zero finish in the round. And just to add insult to injury, this necessitated a wild card to fill the third spot in the finals. The eventual wild card went on to win the tournament.</li><li> On <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=4847">March 12, 2015<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; two contestants finished in the red and were disqualified from Final Jeopardy!; with Stephanie Hull finishing with a possible record low of <strong>-$6,800.</strong></li><li> On January 18, 2016, two contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $13,800 while the third finished with $6,000. All three contestants missed Final Jeopardy!, wagered their entire earnings and finished the game with $0, even more surprising when you realize that this game had <em>two</em> returning champions (though in fairness to the two of them, betting it all when tied going into Final is a valid strategy in that scenario).</li><li> On February 1, 2018, all three contestants failed to ring in for "Talkin' Football", an entire American football-themed category (to tie in with that weekend's Super Bowl). What made this even more painfully obvious was that <em>nobody touched the category until the very end of the round</em>, as the rest of the board had already been cleared. This resulted in triple stumper after triple stumper for five clues straight, prompting increasingly snarky and hilarious comments from Alex, causing the studio audience to have huge fits of laughter, and giving the media a field day with the story, reinforcing the Jeopardy! stereotype of egghead contestants who know zilch about sports. The official <em>Jeopardy!</em> YouTube channel couldn't resist <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h33u2eeVqXo">putting it up<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapeArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapeArtist">Escape Artist</a>: Often cited for <em>Jeopardy!</em> champions who frequently win games despite trailing going into Final Jeopardy!, where they're not in control of their destiny and likely need the leading contestant to be incorrect or do the wagering math wrong to have a shot at victory.<ul><li> September 2001 5 day champion Mark Dawson used some skill and luck to force some big escapes in Final. In his very first game (where he trailed $7,600-$7,000), he won after wagering all but $1 in Final, as the leader just wagered $1,400, rather than the $6,401 lockout wager. A $0 wager on a triple stumper won him his fourth game, while a $200 math error from leading finalist Brian Weikle handed Mark the Tournament of Champions victory in May 2003. More recently, a light wager from second helped Mark win his opening game of 2014's Battle of the Decades tournament, allowing him to lock out Claudia Perry and allow him to steal the win when Dave Abbott missed Final.</li><li> June 2006 5 day champion Celeste DiNucci definitely knew how to wager from behind during her games, winning her second and final regular games with Final comebacks when her opponents missed and she wagered to stay above them if she did the same. She pulled it off again in the 2007 Tournament of Champions, surging past Jeff Spoeri to force a tiebreaker with Christian Haines in the semifinals (which she won), before one final savvy wager helped her steal the championship from Doug Hicton in the finals, despite his own impressive performance in the second game.</li><li> May 2012 6 day champion Joel Pool needed an escape from second place to win four of his six games, only leading going into Final for his second and fourth games. In each case, the leader missed, with Joel wagering almost everything in 3 of 4 occasions.</li><li> Eventual 2015 TOC finalist Kerry Greene won her third-fifth games that April after betting basically everything while the leader missed in each case. She pulled one more escape in the Tournament of Champions under similar circumstances that November, rallying past Dan Feitel to make the finals.</li><li> May 2015 5 day champion Andrew Haringer made a habit out of this in his championship reign, winning <em>his first four games</em> after the leading challenger missed Final, including a savvy game 3 wager where he won by $1. However, his final win was a runaway. Coincidentally, Andrew faced Kerry in the TOC quarterfinals. In this case, Kerry led going into Final and won the game, though Andrew secured a wild card.</li><li> Though his massive <em>Jeopardy!</em> successes and winnings speak for themselves, even Brad Rutter needed some big escapes en route to winning his $4 million plus over the years. Were it not for Leslie Frates gambling on a $0 wager in the Million Dollar Masters semifinals, Michael Rooney missing Final and not accounting for Brad's wagering savvy in the Ultimate TOC quarterfinals, and Ken Jennings missing Final in game 2 of the Battle of the Decades finals, Brad's career winnings would <em>only</em> be $330,102.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">Every Year They Fizzle Out</a>:<ul><li> After becoming the biggest cash winner of season 17, 2001 Tournament of Champions semifinalist Babu Srinivasan was invited to all three of Jeopardy!'s most recent reunion tournaments (the Million Dollar Masters Tournament in 2002, the Ultimate Tournament of Champions in 2005, and the Battle of the Decades in 2014), but was eliminated in the opening round each time. If you count the 2001 Tournament of Champions, he's <em>0-5</em> in tournament play (he was a wild card semifinalist in 2001). Coincidentally, all four tournaments that he was in were won by all-time money winner Brad Rutter, but they oddly have never been drawn into the same match.</li><li> Similarly, two early 4 day champions (Lionel Goldbart in 1986 and Kate Waits in 1987) were favourite invitees to later tournaments, but they also finished their <em>Jeopardy!</em> runs with 5 straight losses. Both lost their 5th and final regular play game, both games in their respective TOC (they were each wild card semifinalists), the <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> quarterfinals, and their opening game in a later reunion tournament each (Lionel in 1993's 10th Anniversary Tournament and Kate in 2002's Million Dollar Masters tournament). If you count <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em>, Kate has lost <em>six</em> straight, having lost on the Crackle spinoff in February 2015.</li><li> Since winning her five games in December 2007, Cora Peck has gone 0-4, losing in her attempt to win her sixth game, in the quarterfinals and semifinals in the 2009 Tournament of Champions (she was a wildcard semifinalist), and on <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> in July 2015, when she overwagered in a lock situation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcitedShowTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcitedShowTitle">Excited Show Title!</a>: The show's name has always ended in an exclamation point.

As fate would have it, the finalists in that year's TOC were... Vijay Balse, Jason Zollinger, and Stefan Goodreau, who each won their separate semifinal games. (Balse won the two-day final rematch.)</li><li> 1987 Tournament of Champions winner Bob Verini seemed fated to rematch many of his tournament opponents. In 1990's <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> tournament, he faced both of the other 1987 finalists (Eugene Finerman and Dave Traini) in the last two rounds, and while he did defeat Finerman (and 1989 Teen Tournament winner Eric Newhouse) in their rematch, he and Traini both were upset by Bruce Seymour in the finals. Then, in 2002, Verini rematched Eric Newhouse in the finals of the Million Dollar Masters tournament, though both lost to Brad Rutter.</li><li> In tournament play on the syndicated version, <em>Jeopardy!</em> producers traditionally avert booking rematches from prior rounds or tournaments unless it's the finals when you can't get around it, and fate has seen a number of rematches from quarterfinal opponents there. TOC rematches from regular play games, however, have occurred on two rare occasions. After eventual 3 day champion Vik Vaz defeated 4 day champion Bill Macdonald in November 2005, they both managed to advance to the finals of the May 2006 Tournament of Champions, where Vaz outplayed Macdonald again, only for both to lose to Michael Falk. 7 years later, eventual 5 day champion Paul Nelson dethroned 7 day champion Keith Whitener in November 2012, only for them to surprisingly be booked against each other in the semifinals of the February 2013 TOC. Despite the presence of 9 day champion Jason Keller in the same match, Whitener avenged his original loss to advance to the finals.</li><li> Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter have competed against each other in a record eight episodes of <em>Jeopardy!</em>, with Brad defeating Ken in the finals of both the Ultimate Tournament of Champions and the Battle of the Decades, while both lost to the Watson supercomputer in The IBM Challenge. However, as both are elite level <em>Jeopardy!</em> contestants, their own knowledge bases and buzzer skills are arguably more to blame than fate.</li><li> Similar to the 2010 TOC example, the finalists of the 1992 College Tournament, Nick Jungman, Stephanie Leveene, and Billy Baxter, all played against one another in the quarterfinals. Nick had won their quarterfinal match with Billy and Stephanie advancing as wildcards, each winning their separate semifinal games, before Billy ended up winning the tournament.</li><li> The November 2019 Tournament of Champions found James Holzhauer competing against Emma Boetcher, who defeated him in regular play. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">James defeated her in the tournament.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a>:<ul><li> One Final Jeopardy that aired sometime between 1986 and 1991 ended this way. The Final Jeopardy answer was "These are two of the US States with the lowest population". Kathy was leading the game with $5,200 (having made a beautiful comeback in Double Jeopardy, according to Alex) answered "Alaska, Wyomming" which were both correct. As the applause started, Alex recapped the other correct states, and asked for Kathy's wager. However, Alex suddenly realized that Kathy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">didn't phrase her response in the proper question format.</a> Therefore her correct answer couldn't be counted, and Kathy's wager of $3,201, which would've increased her score to a winning $8,401, instead dropped her final score to $1,999. Contestant Jeff, who had been in second place at Final Jeopardy, also missed the question, but as he finished with $2,200, he ultimately ended being the winner of that episode. Both Alex and Jeff were comforting and sympathetic towards Kathy afterwards.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>:<ul><li> If the player in the lead has more than twice as much as the second-place player going into Final Jeopardy!, no one can catch them.

Champion Roger Craig finished the first day of the final with a $31,200 lead over 2nd place opponent Tom Nissley, who finished Double Jeopardy! with $14,600 on the second day; Roger was therefore guaranteed to win the tournament by $2,000 or more no matter what everybody wagered.</li><li> A 2004 Power Players Week game featuring Al Franken had a category entitled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">SNL</a> Presidential Players".

He jokingly remarked afterward that "at least I got to say 'What is Pooh?' on national television", to much laughter and applause (the correct response was Baloo from <em>The Jungle Book</em>).</li><li> For a show that's rated TV-G, they've gotten lots of "damn"s and "hell"s past the censors.

It is, however, rather common for Double Jeopardy! to end with second place having less than half of the leader's score. The leader can simply bet nothing and be guaranteed a victory.

As such, only five categories could be played per round and one window in Double Jeopardy! had to be reserved for Final.</li><li> Inexplicably, the later 1980s/90s Pressman versions kept the same odd setup for the board and Final Jeopardy, and even versions released as late as 2003 still had it; they also released <em>Electric Jeopardy!</em>- with a set of battery operated buzz-in devices with rotating dials for scorekeeping. Conversely, the 1992 Tyco version had a radically different style of gameplay (six category stands instead of a board, with the players splitting up the duties of answering and reading each one), while the 1999 Parker Brothers version finally had the board with the correct amount of categories, and reserved a special space for Final Jeopardy! below the main board.</li><li> Around 1990, there was also a premium-rate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeParticipationSweepstakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeParticipationSweepstakes">Home Participation Sweepstakes</a> phone-in version known as "Phone <em>Jeopardy!</em>" (<em>Wheel</em> had one, too).</li><li> For many years, <em>Jeopardy!</em> advertised on-air and sold the Jeopardy!

While often mistaken for a game, it's basically a modified calculator. Though it's obsolete for modern episodes (as it was made for games before dollar amounts were doubled), equivalent scorekeepers are available online and on mobile devices that feature the current values.</li><li> Tiger Electronics released two handheld LCD <em>Jeopardy!</em> games in the late 1990s. Due to technical limitations, the first version merely listed numbers for each clue that you'd have to read in a companion book that came with the game or its expansion cartridges, while the second version allowed for a scrolling clue display, and is better received as a result.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse">Hufflepuff House</a>: Sometimes, one or two players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> or otherwise have so much trouble keeping pace that they almost become irrelevant in the game.

Notable examples include 1995 Tournament of Champions winner Ryan Holznagel (who played under his long-time nickname Fritz in 2014's Battle of the Decades), 2004 4 day champion Scott Renzoni (who played as "Renzo" for his appearances), and 2008 Teen Tournament finalist Rachel Cooke, who played as "Steve" for the whole tournament, luckily so when she faced Rachel Horn in the finals. Averted with 1988 Teen Tournament finalist David Javerbaum, who only played as "DJ" in the finals out of necessity, as another finalist was named David.<ul><li> Similarly, some <em>Jeopardy!</em> champions have made return appearances under a different variation of the first name they originally played under. Some examples include Dan Green (Danny in the 1986 TOC), Sandra Gore (Sandy in <em>Super Jeopardy!</em>), Mike Day (Michael in the 1985 and Ultimate TOCs), Michael Dupee (Mike in the 1996 TOC and Battle of the Decades), Michael Thayer (Mike in the Ultimate TOC), Dave Traini (David in the Ultimate TOC), and Andy Westney (Andrew in the Ultimate TOC and Battle of the Decades).</li><li> <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> host Dan Patrick occasionally gives nicknames to successful repeat champions, like "The Duke of Earl" for season 3 8-time champion Earl Holland, and "Vinny V" for season 2 15-time champion Vinny Varadarajan.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InflationNegation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InflationNegation">Inflation Negation</a>:<ul><li> The Fleming version used the same dollar figures in its entire run, with the lowest clue valued at a mere $10.

Nowadays, you only see a wager that small if a contestant isn't certain that they'll get it right, and don't feel like risking any money on it. One notable example was when Arthur Chu found a Daily Double in a sports category during his second game in January 2014.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>:<ul><li> In the 2006 Teen Tournament semifinals, high school sophomore Papa Chakravarthy (who is of Indian descent) lost $1,000 on the first Daily Double in a clue about an Asian 2 word capital constructed in the 1910s and 1920s. He guessed Phnom Penh, Cambodia, but the correct question was "What is <em>New Dehli</em>?" Despite the ironic miss, he only lost $1,000, and still won both the game and the tournament.</li><li> On April 27, 2012, a contestant missed the last clue of the game, a Daily Double which presented lyrics to "I Lost on Jeopardy" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> ("My hope of winning sank, 'cause I got the Daily Double now, and then my mind went blank").

Many Teen Tournament champs made TOC semifinals, with Eric Newhouse, Matt Zielenski, Sahir Islam, and Chacko George winning TOC quarterfinal games to get there (Chacko even defeated eventual finalist Steve Fried in their opening game), and The Final Wager's Keith Williams noted that Teen Tournament winners performed better on average than College Champions in the TOC. However, no Teen champions ever made the finals in their own right, a possible contributing factor to why they're no longer in the TOC field.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>:<ul><li> 1986 contestant Barbara Lowe was said by many eyewitnesses to be a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>&mdash;she quibbled with Trebek on-camera when one of her answers was ruled wrong, and, according to ex-writer Harry Eisenberg, drew irate letters from fans for her behavior. Nonetheless, she retired undefeated. However, she had previously appeared on several game shows, most by using aliases, and had lied to <em>Jeopardy!</em> about how many she'd been on (at the time, you could only be on two in a five-year span). She was barred from appearing in the Tournament of Champions, and her winnings were withheld until she threatened them with a lawsuit.</li><li> On <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3171">October 12, 2009<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, one of the contestants was Jeff Kirby, who originally appeared on the show in December 1999. As stated at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShowWinningsCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShowWinningsCap">Game Show Winnings Cap</a>, Trebek-era contestants are not allowed to appear again, but Jeff somehow got through the audition process. He didn't get caught until someone on the show's message board pointed out that he was wearing <em>the same tie</em> he had worn in his 1999 appearance. (Either he has a spectacularly limited wardrobe, or he was thumbing his nose at the powers that be.) What makes him fit into this trope? He finished in third place on both shows (and of course, was denied the $1,000 third-place winnings from his 2009 episode).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>:<ul><li> The clues were initially far more straightforward, as compared to the show's current affinity for puns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>. Whether or not this has dumbed down the show is up to the viewer.</li><li> Alex Trebek himself. During the early seasons, Trebek was more akin to a very strict teacher: he would snap at the contestants if they forgot a rule (most commonly, phrasing with "What is ...?") or giving an answer that was inappropriate to the category (such as in a category about numbers, anything other than a numerical answer), and treated the show very seriously. Once the writers began loosening up with more esoteric and humorous categories, Trebek's hosting style became less formal with it. Particularly in the 2000s, it's now become very common for him to laugh, smile, and joke around with the contestants.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongSongShortScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongSongShortScene">Long Song, Short Scene</a>: Since 1997, the opening themes for <em>Jeopardy!</em> are full two-to-three-minute orchestrations featuring a wide array of arrangements on a variety of instruments, from electric guitars to saxophones to brass. However, the opening introduction is only 45 seconds long, and with the closing credits shaved for time constraints over the years, most viewers will never hear the theme in full unless they go hunting for it online. Even the original synthesized theme fell into this, as the building opening notes were stretched out over the contestant introductions, but Alex would be introduced and the music stopped before the actual melody kicked in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>:<ul><li> Any time a contestant bends the "form of a question" rules by saying something like "Could that be ____?" or "Is that an ____?". The judges aren't terribly picky on what constitutes a question.<ul><li> One contestant actually got credit for answering "Time Magazine. <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>]</em> What's that?", and another got credit for just saying "Who?" when the correct response was "Who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>?"</li></ul></li><li> If the response itself is a question, nothing more needs to be done.</li><li> Ken Jennings had fun with this in his 46th game from September 2004, questioning an answer with "What be ebonics?", which was accepted.</li><li> Picking clues out of order (known as the "Forrest Bounce") can be seen as this by many, although in many cases it may be strategically advantageous. It also seemed to become more commonplace after Arthur Chu used it to his advantage.</li><li> One Final Jeopardy! had the correct response of "What is oxygen?" A contestant only got as far as writing "What is O?" before time ran out, but the judges accepted it because "O" is the periodic symbol for oxygen.</li><li> Countless contestants have given an incorrect response, and quickly corrected themselves before Alex or the judges can rule them correct. As long as the correction is made before the ruling is given, then the response is valid.</li><li> When tie games were allowed in regular play, a handful of contestants in the lead after <em>Double Jeopardy!</em> were known to play to tie games on purpose. Some would do so out of kindness (such as to allow a challenger to come back after the reigning champion's 5th and final win), but others like Arthur Chu used it as strategy, to allow a trailing contestant (that was perceived to be weaker) to tie them, come back the next day, and be outperformed again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Lovely Assistant</a>: Downplayed example with the "Clue Crew", a cast of assistants who provide pre-recorded visual clues regularly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a>: If a round ends with multiple clues on which no one rings in, then they are typically edited out.

This is usually due to either the judges or Alex mishearing a response; Alex failing to explain a category with a gimmick; or an inaccurate or ambiguous clue misleading a contestant. Should a correction be needed, it will usually be given upon returning from commercial, or before a Daily Double.</li><li> If a contestant is found to have lost a game via an unfair ruling on a question that impacted the outcome, or via a flaw in game mechanics, they're often brought back on later episodes as a concession. Contestants like India Cooper, Paul Croshier, Bob Mesko, Tom Nichols, and Claudia Perry have benefited from such re-invites to later secure Tournament of Champions slots.<ul><li> Averted if a contestant is brought back after an aforementioned error, only to lose worse than they did originally. For example, October 2002 4 day champion Phillip Steele was brought back for a second shot at his 5th win (and a 2003 TOC berth) the following April after a technical error in his original 5th game, only for his return episode to be the day that Brian Weikle won a then-record <em>$52,000</em> in an absolute runaway.</li></ul></li><li> In a unique example from tournaments, high school senior Milo Dochow was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the February 1999 Teen Tournament, but after a questionable judges ruling was found to have possibly cost him a semifinal spot, he was brought back for the February 2000 College Championship (though he didn't make it any farther there).</li><li> On December 29, 2015, Final Jeopardy! in the category "Famous Last Names" read, "The first woman space shuttle pilot shares this surname with a man on the 1st manned lunar landing 26 years earlier", with the intended response being "Who is Collins?" Contestant Ashley Wilson answered "Aldrin" and lost all of her $9,400. After the show, a clip was dubbed in of Alex explaining that the clue "should have referred to the entire Apollo 11 mission rather than to just the lunar landing part of it", so Wilson was brought back on the 31st and went on to become a two-day champion.</li><li> This happened <em>three times</em> in Season 34:<ul><li> Rebecca Zoshak lost on the January 11, 2018 episode, which had the Final Jeopardy! clue "It's the first Oscar nominee for Best Picture to be produced by an internet streaming service" with the correct response being "What is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManchesterByTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManchesterByTheSea">Manchester by the Sea</a></em>?" Rebecca wagered $7,575 and gave no response. In a dubbed-in clip during the credits, Alex pointed out that the clue was imprecise due to the film being <em>distributed</em>, not <em>produced</em>, by a streaming service. Zoshak was brought back for March 21, 2018, where she became a one-day champion with $14,407.</li><li> Ryan Fenster, on his fifth game airing February 2, 2018, picked the $1,200 clue in the category "Roamin' Catholics", which read: "St. Thomas Aquinas died traveling to Lyon, France while attempting to heal this rift between the Latin &amp; Greek churches." He rang in with "What is the great schism?", which was deemed too precise for the intended response of just "schism", and he ended up losing the game. Later on, a former writer for the show contacted them and pointed out that "great schism" should've been accepted, so Fenster was brought back to defend in July 2018, where he went on to play for three more games.</li><li> Vincent Valenzuela was a challenger on the July 13, 2018 episode, where Final Jeopardy! was "This slang term for an environmentalist is literally true of groups that used passive resistance vs. deforestation, as in India in 1973." However, when the clue was displayed on the studio's monitors, the "T" was missing, causing it to say "<em>His</em> slang term..." instead and misleading Vincent into crossing out the correct response of "What is a tree hugger?" in favor of a different response. Due to the typo, the producers agreed to bring Vincent back. He reappeared on the September 25, 2018 episode.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes N-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegatedMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegatedMomentOfAwesome">Negated Moment of Awesome</a>: On July 3, 2000, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $5,200.

The September 18, 1983 pilot is basically Alex Trebek in the Fleming era with a "personal computer"-themed set and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LetsMakeADeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LetsMakeADeal">Jay Stewart</a> announcing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>:<ul><li> Very early in the original Fleming run, only the <em>proper</em> phrasing was ruled as correct &#151; contestants phrasing a question incorrectly (e.g., "What is Abraham Lincoln?") were asked by Fleming to use the "proper" phrasing. After Merv Griffin discovered that this was slowing down gameplay, the rule was slightly altered to give credit for a correct response so long as it was phrased in the form of a question. As mentioned above, this rule often gets exploited to its limits.</li><li> Early on, the Final Jeopardy! board was located to the <em>left</em> of the contestants; such a viewpoint not only hurt some necks, but also gave the contestants the ability to see their opponent jotting down their response during the 30-second writing time.</li><li> For the first season of the Trebek era, contestants could ring in as soon as the clue was revealed, which was also true of the Fleming era. This often led to more than one podium lighting up at the same time, or contestants buzzing in so quickly that their time limit expired before Alex finished reading the clue. In addition, Alex himself said that he found the original buzzer system annoying and distracting to home viewers. From season 2 onward, the buzzers activate after the clue is finished, and premature ring-ins are locked out for 1/8 of a second.</li><li> After a contestant lost because he forgot to phrase his Final Jeopardy! response as a question, they changed the rules so that the contestants write the "What" or "Who" part on their screens during the commercial break along with their wager, as opposed to writing it concurrently with the response. This is why some contestants who fail to come up with a Final Jeopardy! response will have only the word "what" or "who" on their screen, while others will accidentally omit the "is".</li><li> <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> games originally saw each contestant guaranteed $10,000 for their charity, unless they won more during the game, with the week's biggest winner having their cash total doubled. As a result, if a low-scoring game resulted in no one surpassing $10,000 after Final Jeopardy!, everyone left with the same amount of money no matter who won. After <em>three</em> of the five Celebrity games from November 1996 resulted in sub-$10,000 scores for winning contestants (including a triple zero finish when all three contestants went all-in on Final), the first place minimum was increased to $15,000 for future installments, later jumping to $50,000 after clue values were doubled in 2002, and the doubled cash bonus was also eliminated after 1996. As well, after the triple-zero game, the rules were changed so that the leader after Double Jeopardy! would be named the winner if everyone went all-in and lost on Final, as seen with the 1998 "Ladies Night" celebrity game.</li><li> Money equal to their score was awarded to all contestants in the Art Fleming era, but that changed to a "winner-take-all" format for the Trebek version, which promotes more risk taking for a more exciting show, and prevents contestants from ending participation if they've reached some needed goal amount.</li><li> According to 2002 1 day champion (and future Hollywood actor) Dileep Rao, he was told by <em>Jeopardy!</em> producers that if he had to miss a scheduled taping due to his then-illness, he'd be retired as champion (he made the taping as a result, and finished Double Jeopardy! in the red). Since then, the show's stance has mellowed, allowing then-champions Priscilla Ball (due to illness) and Claudia Corriere (due to work conflicts, which occurred only because Alex's knee surgery postponed tapings for a few weeks) to miss their next taping day and come back for a later taping when ready and able.</li><li> In <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournaments with wild cards since (at least) February 2002, all clues are guaranteed to be cleared from the board in every quarterfinal round, no matter what happened during the game beforehand. This is to ensure an even playing field in regards to contestants competing for wild cards, so as not to disadvantage anyone just because their game went a little slower. The possible instigating moment was in game 4 of the 2002 Teen Tournament quarterfinals, where the losing contestants missed the last wild card slot by $807 and $1,207 respectively, and time ran out before the last $1,000 clue could be called in the first round. However, ensuring 100% of clues get revealed can lead to some awkward cuts and edits when the episode airs.</li><li> After the above-mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> in the 2013 Teen Tournament semifinals where all three contestants finished with no money, the tiebreaker rules in tournament play were changed so that every game would have a declared winner, as the previous method was unfair to other semifinalists who wouldn't know about an extra wild card spot. If a triple zero finish happens again in a tournament, the leader after Double Jeopardy! will be named the winner, similarly to the mid-1990s rule change for celebrity games.</li><li> After a barrage of ties at the start of Season 31, the long-standing rule that ties for first place during regular play result in the tied players becoming co-champions was eliminated in November 2014. As is the case during tournaments, ties for first during regular play are now broken by a tiebreaker clue, though this scenario didn't occur until March 1, 2018.</li><li> Averted with the 2004 addition of extra rehearsal time before games taped in season 21, which followed Ken Jennings' then-48 game winning streak to end season 20. (His first 38 games, plus the first two weeks of season 21, taped during season 20 as a precaution against a potential strike-related work stoppage.) With Ken's streak in full force, producers realized that new challengers might not have as much rehearsal time to effectively compete, hence the added rehearsal time.

A couple others have written variants of "What is I have no idea?" Double subverted on Ken's 64th game. The middle contestant wrote "See next podium" with an arrow, only to point to the one on the right from the audience's point of view.

(anywhere from $888 to $7,887), only not doing so in two of his regular games and his Olympic Games Tournament semifinal. He also made similar wagers on Daily Doubles in game 2 of his TOC final and his reunion tournament appearances, even asking Alex if his $1,111 wager was possible the first time he tried it.</li><li> On June 15th, 2007, 2 day champion Jared Cohen (who finished <em>Double Jeopardy!</em> with just $1) jokingly responded in <em>Final</em> with "What Is Kebert Xela", referencing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> cutaway gag where Alex Trebek reciting his name backwards sent him back to his home dimension (though Alex amusingly forgot the reference, despite doing his own voice).</li><li> November 4, 2011: In a Tournament of Champions quarterfinal, John Krizel and Tom Kunzen enter Final Jeopardy! trailing Joon Pahk by a wide margin.

Among the highlights: "What is Kcirtap Nad?" (trying to send host Dan Patrick to another dimension, though he too didn't get the reference), "Who are two people who have never been in my kitchen?" (referencing Cliff Clavin's <em>Final</em> response on <em>Cheers</em>), "Who is the freeway I got stuck on today I really hate!" (he used <em>Final</em> as a platform to vent over being stuck on California's Interstate 405 that day, fittingly wagering $405), "What is IDK my BFF Jill?" (referencing a popular 2007 Cingular Wireless commercial), and "What is I award you this # of points, &amp; may Dan have mercy on my soul" (referencing a line from the principal during the game show climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillyMadison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillyMadison">Billy Madison</a></em>).</li><li> In the final episode of the IBM challenge, Ken Jennings wrote "I for one welcome our new computer overlords" with his answer and bet (see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> entry, below).

As he was leading in a runaway, he wagered nothing. In that same tournament, he wagered $143 in his quarterfinal win, a common shorthand number for "I love you" popularized by Mr. Rogers. His Final Jeopardy! responses were tamer, complimenting his challengers and the show itself rather than answering (again, wagering nothing on both due to having massive leads).</li><li> Leonard Cooper on the Final Jeopardy! at the end of the Teen Tournament in 2013: "Who is some guy in Normandy?

Smile</a>: Can happen when nobody rings in for certain clues. It happened to all three contestants simultaneously on June 15, 2011; the audience groaned when none of them could answer a clue about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighRollers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighRollers">High Rollers</a></em>, which even had a photo of Alex Trebek on the set.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a>: Any winner of Jeopardy!'s 10 Seniors Tournaments from 1987-1995 for contestants 50 and older, including two Tournament of Champions finalists (Lou Pryor and Marilyn Kneeland). Also applies to any older contestants in regular play that have long championship reigns on the show, and any past champions who do well in later Jeopardy! reunion tournaments, some over 20 years after their original runs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>:<ul><li> Definitely utilized in regular play games to avoid confusion between contestants (hence why no one named Ken ever faced Ken Jennings). For example, after 13 day champion Matt Jackson's loss in October 2015, he was followed a few games later (on the same taping day) by a contestant named Matt Akridge, whose game would presumably have been postponed had Matt Jackson continued his reign that week.</li><li> In tournament play, mostly instituted after the inaugural 1985 Tournament of Champions, which grouped contestants together chronologically via when their original reign on the show was. As a result, 5 day champions Paul Boymel and Paul Croshier were seeded together in the <em>quarterfinals</em>, so Paul Croshier went by "SSGT Paul" for that game, referencing his post as a United States Marine Staff Sergeant. Paul Boymel won and advanced, and <em>Jeopardy!</em> has since seeded quarterfinal matchups without considering the contestants' chronological order. Now, producers avoid having same or similarly-named contestants in the same match where possible, hence why such conflicts only occur in tournament finals.</li><li> In the 1996 Tournament of Champions, there were two contestants <em>each</em> named Michael (Dupee and Daunt), Bill (Sloan and Dickenson), and David (Sampugnaro and Cuneo), with Michael Dupee going as "Mike" for the tournament to avoid confusion. Both of the Davids went out in the quarterfinals, and ditto for the Bills in the semifinals, but both Michaels made the finals, where Dupee won the tournament. He played as Michael again for 2005's Ultimate Tournament of Champions, and then flipped back to Mike in 2014's Battle of the Decades.<ul><li> In an earlier example, the 1988 Tournament of Champions had two contestants <em>each</em> named Bruce (Naegeli and Seymour) and Michael (Rankins and Block), as well as Steven Popper and Stephen Lebowitz, with their first names pronounced the same. In each case, one of the same-named pairs was eliminated in the quarterfinals, and the other made the semifinals (or in Bruce Naegeli's case, the finals).</li><li> The 1990 Tournament of Champions had Eric Terzuolo and Eri<strong>k</strong> Larsen, who were both semifinalists that year.</li><li> In the 1995 Tournament of Champions, two of the finalists were David Siegel and Isaac Segal, both last names pronounced the same way. Interestingly, David Siegel was Isaac Segal's immediate predecessor as champion, which Alex lampshaded in the latter's first 2 games.</li></ul></li><li> Two Teen Tournament finals have seen same-named contestants. The 1988 Teen Tournament finals featured finalists David Javerbaum and David Cook, with Javerbaum going by "DJ" for the finals (both lost to Michael Block). 20 years later, two of the competitors in the 2008 Teen Tournament, who both made the finals, were Rachel Horn (the eventual winner) and Rachel Cooke. In this case, Rachel Cooke was introduced as Rachel "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Steve</a>" Cooke, and played as Steve, which was a nickname she was referred to at school.</li><li> This trope was especially needed in the 2003 Tournament of Champions, which had <em>three</em> contestants named Mark (Brown, Dawson, and Lee), and as they weren't seeded together, only three of that year's 10 TOC games didn't feature a contestant named Mark. Luckily, the scenario of a final round with three Marks didn't occur, as Mark Lee didn't make the semifinals, and Mark Brown didn't make the finals, while Mark Dawson eventually claimed first place in the tournament.<ul><li> On a far bigger scale, 2005's Ultimate Tournament of Champions featured <em>nine</em> players that played as Michael during prior runs on the show, with only 1990 College Champion Michael Thayer opting to play as Mike this time around. Of the nine, both Michael Daunt and Michael Rooney advanced to the quarterfinals. Also, had Michael Block accepted his invite, there would have been <em>ten</em> Michaels in the field.</li></ul></li><li> Averted when there are contestants named Alex, as Alex Trebek has posed answers to a number of contestants with the same first name, most notably 2015 Tournament of Champions winner and 6 day champion Alex Jacob. Johnny Gilbert has announced contestants that went by the name Johnny (as opposed to John or Jonathan) on the show as well.</li><li> In 2013, contestants named Tim Anderson and Stuart Anderson each became 3 day champions with winnings in the $50,000 range. Ironically, both lost their fourth game after missing Final Jeopardy! and wagering big in the process. The next time a 3 day champion with the last name Anderson competed on Jeopardy! (Sean Anderson in October 2015), he too lost after missing Final and wagering most of his money.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a>:<div class="indent"><strong>Johnny Gilbert:</strong> "This... is... <em>Jeopardy!</em> Introducing today's contestants: <em>[lists off the two challengers and their occupations and city]</em>, AND our returning champion, <em>[gives occupation, city, and name]</em>, whose [X] day <em>cash</em> winnings total [amount] dollars.

This pilot was originally prepared for CBS.</li><li> September 18, 1983: Alex Trebek with the 1978-79 set layout and music, now themed like a personal computer. Final Jeopardy! was reinstated, and Jay Stewart was the announcer.</li><li> Early 1984: Similar to the eventual series, except 1) the dollar amounts were halved ($50-$250/$100-$500), 2) the contestant podiums had nameplates along with each contestant's personal signature, 3) the <em>Jeopardy!</em> logo on the board was very basic, 4) the theme music was a slightly different arrangement of what it would eventually become, and 5) Alex's podium looked remarkably like the "clicker podiums" (with the <em>Jeopardy!</em> logo on top) seen in various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGame">Home Game</a> adaptations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerNudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerNudge">Player Nudge</a>:<ul><li> If a contestant hits a Daily Double, Alex will sometimes remind them of their score in comparison to their opponents &#151; for instance, "You have exactly half of X's total", which pretty much translates to "I really hope you make it a true Daily Double". He sometimes gives similar score-related nudges going into Final Jeopardy!</li><li> Sometimes subverted for laughs if a player with a significant lead hits a Daily Double, and Alex jokingly suggests that they make it a true Daily Double.</li><li> Increasingly so in the 2000s, this is baked right into the clues themselves; where the game originally had straight-forward "answers" (ex. "He was the 40th president"), a bulk of the clues now give contextual hints in order to give players a hand (ex. "He was the 40th president, much to Doc Brown's disbelief 30 years earlier").</li><li> If someone gives a response that doesn't fit the theme of the category the clue is in, and there are further clues to be played in that category, Alex will usually remind the players of it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticianGuestStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticianGuestStar">Politician Guest Star</a>: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director (and former Ohio Attorney General) Richard Cordray returned to <em>Jeopardy!</em> 27 years after his original 5 day championship reign and 1987 TOC semifinal run to compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament in 2014.

Had he known about the rules regarding prior game show appearances, who knows how he'd have done as a contestant later on.</li><li> Barbara Lowe may count here as well, but given her reputation as a professional contestant who competed under aliases, it's more likely that she <em>disregarded</em> the manual.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong">Rearrange the Song</a>: Though they kept the original 1964 "Think!" recording for Final Jeopardy!, that same melody was used as the main theme once the 1984 version started up. At first, the main theme was performed with synthesizer and saxophone leads. The intro was truncated in 1991, and bongos were dubbed in a year later. Starting in 1997, both the main theme and the "Think!" music have received multiple orchestral re-arrangements. <em>Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!</em> used an electric guitar remix of the theme, and <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> a more marching band-styled one. The main show used the <em>Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!</em> theme for many years during college tournaments, but switched to using the <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> version in 2020.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredGameShowElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredGameShowElement">Retired Game Show Element</a>: During Season 14 (1997-1998), the show briefly tried "bonus" categories &#151; clues with two correct responses.

By the time of 2002's Million Dollar Masters tournament, Bob and fellow 1998 TOC fan favourite Claudia Perry both made the field, even though Dan defeated both in 1998.</li><li> Michael Falk may have won 2006's Tournament of Champions, but it's hard to overshadow 19 day champion David Madden, who defeated Falk in the quarterfinals.

This category takes a notable saying or title and the displayed clue is a reworded version of that saying/title, with the contestant needing to provide the original. One notable example from a fake Disney memo regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGreatMouseDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGreatMouseDetective">The Great Mouse Detective</a></em>: <em>The Girl With The See-Through Shoes</em>.

Place</em>", where the clues were written in a soap opera style. Later "episodes" of the category had Johnny narrate the clues like a soap opera. The last episode with the category had it worded as "<em>Jeopardy! Place: The Final Episode</em>".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>:<ul><li> Frequently, a clue is written so that it may hint at one answer but then throws in a key word at the last second to negate what would seem like the more sensible answer. For example, "His efforts to hold the Union together were ineffectual; 7 states seceded on his watch." Luckily, the contestant avoided the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a> response and gave the correct one (James Buchanan, <em>not</em> Abe Lincoln).</li><li> There's no way the writers didn't expect someone to say it, but there's almost no way they expected <em>Ken Jennings</em> to say "What's a ho[e]?" to "This term for a long-handled gardening tool can also mean an immoral pleasure seeker." (The correct response, "rake", was given by another contestant.) Judging by Ken's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJO7hcinS-U">massive grin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and how ridiculously far ahead he was at the time, he likely threw the question intentionally just to be funny.</li><li> An example from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=455">July 20, 2005<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had eventual 19 day champion David Madden win after trailing $200 at the end of Double Jeopardy! because he didn't fall for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a> in Final Jeopardy. The clue alluded to the "Ode to Joy" in Beethoven's 9th Symphony, but the use of "70-minute work" meant that the correct response specifically meant the entire symphony. The player in the lead put "Ode to Joy" and wagered to cover if David doubled up, costing her the game.</li><li> Another example was used on <a class="urllink" href="http://j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=4255">July 12, 2013<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: "The title princess of this <strong>game</strong>, which launched a best-selling franchise, was named for F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife." It was used in the <em>Final Jeopardy!</em> round, meaning Alex could not remind the contestants to be more specific if they provided a response. The end result started a debate on Kotaku. (Only eventual 4 day champion and 2014 TOC semifinalist Mark Japinga gave the correct response of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" - the other two contestants simply wrote "Zelda" and were judged incorrect.)</li><li> An excellent one on June 18, 1987 that happened entirely by accident. The clue in "South Africa" for $500 read, "Of go in or go elsewhere, what to do when you see a restroom marked 'Here'." Marty rings in and says "What is go elsewhere?" which is ruled wrong. Kathleen then rings in and says "What is go in?", which is also ruled wrong. A confused Bob Verini doesn't ring in, at which point Alex reveals that "Here" means "men", so either Bob or Marty would've been ruled right for saying "go in", and Kathleen right for "go elsewhere". Former clue-writer Carlo Panno later <a class="urllink" href="http://ken-jennings.com/blog/archives/776">revealed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in an interview with Ken Jennings that this was one of his favorite clues.</li><li> On January 13, 2000, there was a category called Nymph-O-Rama.

With qualifying periods now running between TOCs, new seasons just continue the existing timeline in the lead-up to the next event.<ul><li> The last games of a <em>Jeopardy!</em> season are usually regular games, but from 1989-1995, the season always ended with the annual Seniors Tournament, before being moved to December for its last installment. Since then, the only season-ending special events have been two Teen Tournaments, two Kids Weeks, and 1996's Olympic Games Tournament (though its four episode run time meant that season 12 ended with a regular Friday episode).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a>: Alex has occasionally dipped into this.<ul><li> February 19, 1997: Before the episode's Final Jeopardy, Alex remarks about having given incorrect information beforehand.<div class="indent"><strong>Alex:</strong> A little while ago, a clue referred to three atoms, and then I come along and give "NH4" as the formula for ammonia.

All of the contestants answered with seven, but Alex pointed out that the answer was actually six because Dopey couldn't talk.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a>:<ul><li> The IBM Challenge in 2011, which was taped at an IBM lab in New York, with the first match was split between two episodes, allowing room for lots of behind-the-scenes footage (Also, the whole conceit of a <em>computer</em> facing off with real <em>Jeopardy!</em> contestants.)</li><li> While the Art Fleming-era Tournaments of Champions were generally one week events similar in structure to the second half of most modern-era tournaments, the 1969 TOC featured <em>eighteen</em> contestants in a unique 2 week format (6 quarterinals, 2 semifinals, and a final round with a losing semifinalist as a wild card). The next year, the TOC reverted to a week, but dropped the two day final for two one-day finals with separate groups of contestants. The regular TOC format returned in 1971.</li><li> 1990's <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> tournament, which was held weekly on ABC rather than during episodes of the syndicated version, and featured a number of elements not repeated in later events, like playing for points instead of dollars, inflated clue values of 200-1,000 and <em>500-2,500</em>, semifinal games spread out during the season, the inclusion of two Seniors Tournament winners, and most uniquely of all, quarterfinal games with <em>four</em> contestants, leading to much more crowded gameplay. Not to mention, the invitation of a player solely based on his performance on the Art Fleming version (Burns Cameron) was unique to this event.</li><li> 1993's Tenth Anniversary Tournament uniquely saw contestants randomly drawn on air during season 10 episodes, one from each of the show's first 8 seasons (season 9 was automatically represented by that year's TOC winner). As a result, the contestant range was more unpredictable than <em>Jeopardy!</em>'s other reunion tournaments. Another difference: the tournament winner earned what was won in the two day final, plus a $25,000 bonus, rather than a flat grand prize.</li><li> The 1996 Olympic Games Tournament (the first of three International tournaments) featured a one-day final, leading to the shortest ever <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournament at just four games long. Only this event, <em>Super Jeopardy!</em>, and 1998's Teen Reunion Tournament used a one-day final among modern-era tournaments.</li><li> When <em>Jeopardy!</em> travelled to Berkley, California to tape the 1998 College Championship, they also taped a special episode called "The Battle of the Bay Area Brains" that aired only in the San Francisco market, rather than among that season's national syndicated run. It featured three notable champions from the area competing for charity, with 1988 TOC semifinalist Michael Rankins defeating 10th Anniversary Tournament finalist Leslie Frates and 1996 TOC semifinalst Beverly Spurs to win a $7,700 prize package.</li><li> In November 1998, <em>Jeopardy!</em> taped two weeks of shows in Boston, Massachusetts, starting with 5 regular games, the only time (to date) that they've taped regular games outside of Sony Pictures Studios. The second week played host to their Teen Reunion Tournament, featuring twelve contestants who competed in the inaugural Teen Tournaments from 1987-1989 competing for $50,000, which was won by 1989 champion Eric Newhouse. This event uniquely featured <em>four</em> semifinal games and a one day final, with the lowest earning semifinal winner missing the finals (but receiving an extra cash bonus). Though unique to this tournament on <em>Jeopardy!</em>, it is similar to <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>'s then Friday Finals format. As well, this is the only <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournament to ever invite back losing contestants from prior annual tournaments, as the only prior Teen Tournament winner in the field was Eric Newhouse.</li><li> <em>Jeopardy!</em> hosted a one-off Armed Forces Week in 1999 featuring active military personnel as contestants. The games were stand-alone matches with the biggest winner's cash total being doubled, similarly to early Celebrity weeks; Navy lieutenant Jeff Krause led the week, and won a doubled cash haul of $36,000. This is also the only special <em>Jeopardy!</em> event (other than a 1998 Celebrity Jeopardy! game) to primarily take place in the month of June. Though an Armed Forces Week was once advertised to return in July 2013, it hasn't been held since the original week, but armed forces veterans have always been welcome to compete on regular games.</li><li> In many respects, 2005's Ultimate Tournament of Champions. With 145 contestants total, the use of byes for notable past contestants, no wild cards, game winners receiving their end-of-game scores, two-day <em>semifinal</em> games, the use of a <em>three day</em> final, and a <em>$2,000,000</em> top prize definitely all set this apart from other special events. It's also the only reunion tournament to date that invited Teen Tournament winners after their 2000 removal from TOC fields, the only one to feature College Champions competing against Teen Tournament winners in the same game, and the only <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournament of any kind to move contestants to different podiums after the first game of a 2 or 3 day (semi)final.</li><li> The Battle of the Decades, held in 2014, differed from some prior tournaments by grouping contestants by which "decade" (1984-93, 1994-2003, and 2004-13) their runs on the show took place under, with decades separated for the first round, and a contestant from each in all 5 quarterfinal games. It also uniquely featured fan voting to select three competitors in the field as "fan favourites". It's also the only tournament to date where a Teachers Tournament winner and College Champion were matched up in the same game (Burnett vs. Mueller in the semifinals).</li><li> The 2019 "All Star" tournament featured six teams, each composed of three champions. Each team had an individual member play one part of the game &mdash; one played the Jeopardy! round, one played Double Jeopardy!, and one played Final Jeopardy!</li><li> In January 2020, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> began airing a primetime "Greatest of All Time" event featuring Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and recent James Holzhauer.

However, this is actually a <em>positive</em> trope for the show, as it builds an anticipatory buzz for the episode that night that would not have otherwise been there. James Holzhauer's final game in 2019, which was leaked prior to air that he would finally bow out with the second-highest win and cash totals in <em>Jeopardy!</em> history, was watched by 14.5 million viewers, the best viewership since Ken Jennings finished up his record run in 2004, with 18 million viewers.<ul><li> Tournaments are usually immune to this, as the audience for those is by invitation only.

This wager was even more dangerous when you take into considering his nearest opponent had $9,600, so a wager of anything $17,399 or lower would have secure a win. Fortunately, Skyler was not caught off-guard with the final, and he ended up winning a kids' record of $66,600.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsWhatSheSaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsWhatSheSaid">That's What She Said</a>: A category on the March 16, 2011 game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkMusic">Think Music</a>: The 30-second melody used during Final Jeopardy (which is actually called "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXGhvoekY44">Think!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>") may be the best known example in the genre. <em>TV Guide</em> called it "the <em>Beethoven's Fifth</em> of game show music."

The marker and card are now standard equipment for all players.</li><li> Averted in the 2015 Tournament of Champions quarterfinals, where 5 day champion (and eventual wild card semifinalist) John Schultz accidentally <em>broke</em> his signaling device early in the <em>Jeopardy!</em> round (a tale he recounted on Twitter). Once brought to attention, his signaling device was replaced, the clues where John couldn't ring in were re-shot, and the final episode aired as if nothing happened.</li><li> In July 2018, the in-studio display for the Final Jeopardy! clue omitted the initial letter, turning it from "This slang term for an environmentalist..." to "<em>His</em> slang term for an environmentalist...." One contestant changed his answer from the correct answer ("tree-hugger") to respond to the clue as displayed with "What is Carl Sagan?" He was invited back in the next season because of the error.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: 11/30/2004. Nancy Zerg has just delivered the correct response "What is H &amp; R Block?" to the Final Jeopardy question to take a one dollar lead over Ken Jennings. His response to Final Jeopardy?<div class="indent"><strong>Jennings:</strong> What is FedEx? <em>[the entire audience gasps and Nancy covers her mouth in shock as everyone realizes Jennings' 74-game winning streak is finally dead]</em></div><ul><li> Alex's cancer announcement in 2019.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap">Who Writes This Crap?!</a>: Though uncommon, this is how Alex tends to react whenever the writers are getting a little <em>too</em> clever. Case in point, the "Irish People?" category from March 27, 2019:<div class="indent"><strong>Alex:</strong> These are not real Irish people. Let me give you an example: "Irish cigarette salesman." "Who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Nick O'Tine</a>?" <em>{<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Alex pauses for a few seconds</a>, then looks to the camera)</em> Yeah.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenRoar">Written Roar</a>: On September 24, 2007, a contestant who had only $400 to wager wrote "Who is AARGHH!!!" as his Final Jeopardy! response.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeahShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeahShot">"YEAH!"

However, both lost to Tom Nosek, and <em>Jeopardy!</em> had to wait another year for a woman (Rachael Schwartz) to win the whole thing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic">You Make Me Sic</a>: On the October 14, 2013 episode, the defending champion was penalized for misspelling <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kazakhstan</span> for his Final Jeopardy! response (he misspelled it as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kazkhistan</span>). This led to backlash from angry viewers on Jeopardy!'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> page who thought the judges were being too harsh on spelling, even though the rules for Final Jeopardy! clearly state that "the clue is correct so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation". Since then, after episodes where contestants misspelled Final Jeopardy! responses but they were correct under this rule, backlash on the Facebook page has not been uncommon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">Younger and Hipper</a>:<ul><li> <em>Jep!</em>, the 1997-1998 GSN spinoff of <em>Jeopardy!</em> for kids, and a companion to <em>Wheel 2000</em> (though that show also aired on CBS and is better remembered today). Elements including randomized clue amounts, stuff falling on contestants missing three questions, and "radical" category names like "Super Jep!" and "Hyper Jep!" didn't add up to a long running hit series in this case.</li><li> Averted with Jeopardy!'s annual Kids Weeks (a.k.a. Back to School Weeks) from 1999-2014, which featured contestants of the same age range and clue difficulty, but otherwise doing so on the regular set with the regular rules and staff. It may not be "radical" or "hip", but it had a lot more success and staying power than <em>Jep!</em> had.</li><li> <em>Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!</em> and <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em> can also be seen as this, given their more informal and casual nature and generally less-serious clue content.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom">Your Mom</a>: "Your Momma" was a category on December 16, 2010.
