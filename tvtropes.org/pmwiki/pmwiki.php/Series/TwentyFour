Each season of the series takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime">Real Time</a> over the course of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremelyShortTimespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremelyShortTimespan">24-hour period</a> (each episode is one hour out of that day), during which Jack is called into service to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a> and stop a terrorist threat.</p><p>The first season revolved around an assassination plot on presidential candidate David Palmer.

So far, the threats have been nuclear bombs, a bio-weapon, a nerve agent, and more nuclear bombs, with some presidential assassinations along the way. All in a day's work, eh?</p><p>The series is shot in strict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime">real time</a>, and with commercial breaks included covers a full 24 hours.

It follows not only the adventures of Jack and other field agents, but also political intrigue centering around the people who give Jack orders back at CTU, and sometimes the people who give <em>them</em> orders, such as the President of the United States; the sitting President has been a starring character in every season but the first, and even then Jack reported to the candidate who would be voted into office between Seasons 1 and 2.

The seventh season was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a> which moved the action to the East Coast and generally improved on the fairly mediocre Season 6. Season 8 allowed it to take the title of "Longest-Running spy Show" by episode count away from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em>, which had held the title since 1973. It premiered on January 17, 2010 and moved the action again, this time to New York.

It involved the return of much of the central cast and crew.</p><p>In January 2016, the show was slated for another return. Fox ordered a pilot for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> called <em>24: Legacy</em>. It takes place in the same continuity as the original show and features one returning cast member. Sutherland returned on the other side of the camera, as executive producer, but the showrunners the character of Jack Bauer did not appear. <em>Legacy</em> premiered following the Super Bowl on February 5, 2017, and finished its first season on April 17. But in June of the same year, Fox announced that it was also to be <em>Legacy</em>'s only season, as they cancelled the show, though the channel would at the same time state that they were still looking into creating another incarnation of the series.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnilKapoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnilKapoor">Anil Kapoor</a> has driven forward an effort to create a Hindi-language <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remake">remake</a> of the show, also entitled <em>24</em> but called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourIndia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourIndia">24 (India)</a>" here on the wiki to differentiate. Kapoor plays the main character, Jai Singh Rathod. The show aired on the Indian network Colors.</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourJapan">Japanese remake</a> is currently airing in Japan with the first episode from October 9, 2020 via TV Asahi, starring Toshiaki Karasawa as Jack's equivalent Genma Shidou.</p><p><em>24</em> can be seen as a throwback to earlier works: a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> for the War on Terror, or even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmSerial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmSerial">Republic Serial</a> for the 21st century.

In contrast, a patient in asystole is declared dead after extensive efforts to revive them, and past the threshold at which brain death occurs, usually something on the order of 10-15 minutes. To make this worse, this all takes place in a fully-equipped medical facility, with CPR starting within <em>seconds</em>. The doctors likely still had time to try to revive him, particularly if Jack and Curtis had continued with CPR in the meantime.</li><li> The end result is that while asystole is a very dangerous medical condition, given the resources available and the minimal delay in starting CPR, there would have been a respectable chance of saving his life if they hadn't given up so quickly.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Renee Walker</span> in season 8 is another example of doctors giving up on a patient awfully quickly.

There's no way for Cs-137 levels to be high enough to give a lethal dose in five seconds, and certainly not in open air. Also, if it were possible to do that, the agonizing death would cease to be agonizing simply by hanging around for a full minute, at which point enough radiation would be absorbed to destroy the central nervous system &mdash; two weeks of vomiting your guts out becomes twenty minutes of delirium followed by slipping into a coma and never waking up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseReligion">Artistic License &#150; Religion</a>: In Season 2 between 6:00 and 7:00 PM, Kate Warner agrees to enter a mosque to finger the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who went there for salat (prayer). The mosque has a separate area for women to pray which is true for many mosques, but those mosques usually have a separate entranceway for the males and females and have a more opaque divider than just a shade if the female section is beside or behind the male section (or a two way mirror, where the reflective portion would be facing the male section so the men can't see into the female section). Also, when she enters she gets chastised by a male mosque congregant for being "late" to prayer after she takes off her shoes. Any Muslim can join the iqamah (group prayer) in the middle and make up the rakats (movements) themselves after the congregation finishes theirs (for example, if the congregation prays 1 out of 4 rakats before you join the prayer, after you and the congregation finishes those 3 remaining rakats, you individually continue on prayer with the one you missed). Not only that, but that male (the "Greeter") should be at prayer at the moment and not talking to a veiled female in the mosque with suspicion as if he's a security guard!</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTechnology">Artistic License Technology</a>: Whenever someone (typically Chloe) has to hack something and we see an IP-address, there's a very good chance that the IP-address is completely impossible in the real world.

Terrorist attacks are commonplace (to the point small organizations are capable of enacting attacks they should not be able to enact, and put their hands in Weapons Of Mass Destruction they most definitely should not be able to obtain), and the government has allowed intense interrogations (many times inefficient) of guilty, or sometimes even innocent people, and for government agencies to have the ability to spy on every American, in an attempt to prevent said terrorist attacks, and is only successful sometimes. Almost every Authority Figure is either corrupt, or on the verge of becoming one, no matter how idyllic they are at the start, or is well intentioned but misguided (save David Palmer, who manages to come mostly unscatted). The only thing that usually stands between millions of deaths is one federal agent, and the people helping him (and most of the times they have to do thinfs unofficially, against the government's laws and structures, undercover, or outright illegally). They also live in a world in which, to save innocent lives, they have to do horrible things to get results (be it torture, threatening, murdering terrorist/criminals by the hundreds/thousands, putting innocent/civilians lives in danger, obtaining information illegally, breaking every possible law, sometimes brokering deals with terrorists to catch other bigger threats). And again, these people are the only line between the terrorists and hundreds of thousands/millions of dead people. Most of the people who do this are profoundly miserable, and those are just the ones that manage to survive (and some of those are either broken or end up much darker than before). The institutions are either inefficient, or outright corrupt and intentionally abetting the terrorist (if they aren't the terrorist themselves). Corporation are usually bankrolling attacks for their own profit (one of those is a cabal of 13 different American military businessman, one of them the leader of the biggest private army in the world). And things never seem to get better.<ul><li> Since the start of the show, only David Palmer has been able to finish his tenure as president (and he was deposed by Jim Prescott for some hours, reinstated, and then suffered an attempt on his life, so Prescott had to step up again, until he received an attempt on his life and Palmer took over again until the end of the mandate). And there was an attempt on his life. John Keeler (elected) was deposed because of the attack on the air force one 15 months into his tenure. Logan (unelected) assumed, was forced to resign 18 months after. Hal Gardner (unelected) finished the mandate. Wayne Palmer (elected) lasted only 3 months before falling into a coma (after suffering an attempt against his life), and Noah Daniels finished his mandate. Then he was beaten by Allison Taylor, who had to resing halfway through her mandate, so Mitchel Hayworth had to finish. Then James Heller, who eventually resigns because of Alzheimer, and someone takes his place. In total, there have been 10 acting presidents during the series, from which only 1 managed to end his mandate, and 5 of them were acting presidents. 5 had attempts on their life while in mandate (2 of them died while in term, the other after), two were brought down by corruption and served prison terms (in Logan's case, domiciliary arrest, and then attempted suicide). All this approximately during a period of 22 years. So, all and all, it is frankly a miracle US still exists more or less the same, or that the federal government manages to function at all.</li><li> Since the start of the series, 2 nuclear bombs have been detonated in the US (1 in the desert, other in LA, killing 13k+ people) with 4 failed attempts, plus the nuclear meltdown of a plant (50K+ deaths) which was part of an attempt to melt down every single nuclear plant in the US, one virus attack with close to 1000 victims, a nervous gas attack that was part of a failed conspiracy involving the president of the US and a group of businessman, the Air Force one shot down, the white house was taken by a paramilitary command lead by a renegade tyrant, a Prion attack staged by American military corporations (whom also collaborated in a genocide), sabotage and cover ups by the Chinese and the Russians, or by intelligence agencies or a determined branch or group of people in the government, 3/4 occasions in which the world almost ended up in World War III, with countries being severely trigger happy between each other...and these are just the major incidents (and 6 seasons occur in the same city). 9/11 also happened in 24. So one can only try to imagine what the world would look like if any of these happened in real life. Add this to the above listed...The political, economical, social, psychological, and whatever consequences of all this would be catastrophic.<ul><li> Until season 4, things remained relatively "realistic", and the world of 24 was more of a World Half Full/World Half Empty. The attacks in season 1 (save the plane bombing) were low-key and part of a personal revenge. The nuclear attack in season 2 definitely scarred people's psyches, to the point of almost reaching world war III. And season 3 happened 3 years after, and the virus attack was relatively contained. Plus, it was all during the tenure of the same president, who was well loved, admired, and respected by the US. And it was at the height of the War on Terror, so, while pushing it, it still respected certain things, and you could imagine it was a rough period, but the US people managed to pull through it. Characters had to do brutal things, and while tragedies occurred, there usually was a silver lining of hope, and some things did get better. But in season 4 things get out of hand. The consequences of those attack (nuclear meltdown with 50k+ dead, the destruction of the air force one, plus another attempt of a nuclear attack) would be far bigger than anything shown. Then season 5 happens, which, despite season 4, manages to keep things still relatively realistic...But then, after season 5, you cannot pretend 24 resembles the real world. Not to mention everything seems to go bad for the main characters, and for many many more.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>: Jack, and whichever Big Bad he's facing at the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a>: Usually the head of CTU, or the Regional Director.

Torturing characters rarely gets anyone nowhere. Most of the information is obtained through outsmarting, threatening, scaring, deceiving, or negotiating with the interrogated people (From the villains side: Nina Myers, Syed Ali, Marie Warner, Michael Amador, Stephen Saunders. From the heroes side: Jack himself, Chase Edmunds). In fact, Jack kills someoke by accident (and that person was not going to say anything). He himself is tortured in season 2, and dies before talking (he gets better). But even when torture started becoming more commonplace in season 4, it was still presented as mostly ineffective, and three (four if counting Behrooz) innocents are tortured through the season. Similar things happen in season 5. If anything, the people who usually break during torture are the villanous bureaucreats, or cowardly greedy sell outs. Most of the villains do not break nor can be coerced by torture or pain.<ul><li> The show itself was never pro-torture, so to say. It was always more of the Ends justify the means type (althougj the writers said too a story is a story, and there isn't necessarily a message).</li></ul></li><li> Jack was not an invincible badass as displayed after. Usually, he had to rely more in his wits and his ability to outsmart and deceive his enemies, and he also committed mistakes.</li><li> The world centring around Jack. The first season had a justified example. It was part of a vengeance against him, David Palmer, and other people. In season 2, he was an unexpected factor into the grand plan. But after that, Jack always ends up saving the world, and when nor, the world ends up spinning around him anyway. Sort of subverted in seasons 7 and 8. where he is in the first sort of sidelined, and then ends up being one of the villains.</li><li> The "terrorists" in the first seasons were more nuanced and had a smaller scale. The first season was actually about Serbian warlords looking for revenge against Jack and David Palmer. The second season, while it had muslim terrorist who wanted to detonate a nuke in LA; they ended up being just pawns for NSA and the Oil barons (who actually betrayed each other). Season 3 villain is an ex british operative with a deadly virus, being more over the top. But in season 4 the villain (who also is Muslim, and mind you, 9-11 did happen here) becomes almost invincible and capable of anything. In season 5, while the villains were powerful (the fucking US president) , the conspiracy they created goes to hell in the span of a day. But then, in season 6, the muslim terrorist again are unstoppable, and the chinese having an operative wreacking havoc (not to mention Jack's family), and all almost ending in World War 3. Season 7 has s big cabal of businessmen, from whom the leader had a hand in season 5, and it just becomes ridiculous. Season 8 strands a bit from side to side. And season 9 almost ends up with almost another world war 3.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyLeader">Decoy Leader</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dehumanization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dehumanization">Dehumanization</a>: In <em>Redemption</em> a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> are being trained to kill by presenting them with a trussed up enemy and denying his humanity, calling him a "cockroach" and having them chant "Kill the cockroach!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Depraved Bisexual</a>: Played with in the person of Mandy.

If Jack gets what he wants, the conspiracy behind Hassan's death is exposed, but he'll also kill all those responsible, which includes several members of the Russian government, particularly its president, which would lead to worldwide war.

The irony is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Carlos Bernard</span> only appears in six of the 24 episodes in the season and is only awake in four of them (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at one point, Jack is falsely told that Tony has woken up, leading to an appearance, and then he appears as a corpse in the episode immediately after he dies</span>), so the return to the main cast is actually rather unwarranted.<ul><li> Also done in the case of the second season: Penny Johnson Jerald (Sherry Palmer) had been missing from several episodes and then returned late in the season during one episode as a surprise cliffhanger.

Jack Bauer and CTU seem to be under the impression that torture is more effective than it really is, when in fact even in-universe torture has a pretty high rate of failure, and often has negative consequences when it <em>is</em> used.<ul><li> In Day 2, Jack himself is captured and tortured (not for the last time), and the villains try to get him to give up the information they want, with the lead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a> even getting exacerbated by how long it is taking.

In all three cases, relationships were undermined if not outright ruined since the people torturing them were friends or family, or associates thereof.</li><li> In Day 5, Audrey Raines herself is tortured, having been framed by the villains for selling building schematics to terrorists. The specific villain who had her framed and suggested she be tortured turned out to be ex-agent Christopher Henderson, and his motive was revenge because Jack had tortured <em>him</em> earlier in the season- he <em>was</em> guilty of the crimes he was accused of, but he didn't break either.</li><li> In Day 6, Jack has been a captive of the Chinese for over a year and has been repeatedly tortured for information...with no success whatsoever. He is released as part of a deal that sees him being handed over a terrorist who wants revenge for Jack killing his brother- the terrorist also tortures Jack, but this one is justified since he isn't after information at all, and only wants Jack to suffer.<ul><li> Later that same Day, Jack tortures his own brother Graem when he finds out his company was robbed of weapons of mass destruction and he was trying to cover it up, with mixed results. Graem admits to being behind the assassination of David Palmer as well as numerous attempts on Jacks own life, but that wasn't what Jack was asking for- Graem only admitted to that to shock Jack enough to stop the torture, and is murdered by their also-evil father before he reveals anything else.</li></ul></li><li> In Day 8, Jack spends the entire final act of the episode torturing an agent, only to realize that the agent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Took A Third Option</a> which will require a different response.
