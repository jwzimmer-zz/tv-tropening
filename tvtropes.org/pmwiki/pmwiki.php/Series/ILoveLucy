Ricky insisted on his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">remaining home to do wife things&#133;</a> because he didn't have the heart to tell her she had no talent. Lucy would come up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> to subvert his authority, by either making her own money or sneaking into the show. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> (and this time, it really means it), and a lot of the humor in the episodes' last acts were built around Lucille Ball, in <em>real life</em>, being a very gifted physical comedian.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Ethel Mertz and her husband Fred, Lucy's neighbors and landlords (and in Fred's case, Ricky's sometimes business manager), rounded out the central cast. An old married couple who couldn't stand one another, Fred and Ethel were former vaudevillians that Ricky would occasionally bring into his show, super-charging Lucy's insecurities by leaving her the only member of the gang <em>not</em> in show biz. Ethel would often be the unwilling sidekick to Lucy's harebrained schemes, and Fred would often be the muscle for Ricky's.</p><p>The show is popularly credited with featuring the first "inter-racial" or "inter-ethnic" couple on American television. Mind you, it wasn't viewed that way at the time. Until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">the late 60's</a>, Hispanics were not considered a separate racial group; they were just "foreigners", and a lot of humor between Lucy and Ricky was in their cultural dissonance or in Ricky's funny accent. By today's standards, however, Lucy and Ricky were the first inter-ethnic married couple on TV. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08pdw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note08pdw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08pdw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hispanics were generally counted as part of the white population census, and unlike African- or Asian-Americans did not serve in segregated units in the armed forces. This is not to say Hispanics did not face discrimination; they did. But even white minorities such as the Irish, Poles and Jews also faced discrimination.</span></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The show was filmed, which was a big deal in 1951. At the time, most TV shows were "archived", mainly as a receipt to show sponsors their ads had run, via <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinescope">kinescope<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which is simply a movie camera taking footage of a TV displaying the show's live broadcast. Obviously, this produces really crummy-looking video; that's why most shows from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">the early 50's</a> have either been lost or are of very little interest for reuse (videotape didn't become available until 1956). <em>I Love Lucy</em>, by contrast, was able to use not being broadcast live to its full advantage. Desi Arnaz invented the live studio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeCameras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeCameras">Three Cameras</a> technique, which is still standard in sitcoms to this day. This show also invented the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rerun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rerun">Rerun</a>: when Lucille Ball became pregnant and needed a reduction in her workload, Desi came up with the idea of showing a previously-aired-but-much-loved episode instead of something new, which was only possible because Desilu had taken the trouble to film the original broadcast in the first place. "Reruns?" CBS scoffed, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It Will Never Catch On</a>." Well, the laugh's on them; <em>I Love Lucy</em> has been on the air literally non-stop since it was first produced. Television historians have noted that since its original airing, the show has continuously been in syndication <em>somewhere</em> in the world. And because CBS in their shortsightedness signed all rebroadcast rights over to Desi, this has made Ball's and Arnaz's estates filthy stinking rich.</p><p>It has erroneously been called the first television sitcom to deal with the subject of pregnancy and delivery. This is incorrect, as <em>Mary Kay and Johnny</em>, the first television sitcom in the United States, had tackled the subject four years earlier. Nonetheless it was still a very sensitive topic at the time, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> were horrified. <em>Viewer</em> reaction was actually quite positive, and the episode where Lucy gives birth broke the all-time viewer record up to that point. Because they couldn't actually say "pregnant" on air, they instead popularized the euphemism "expecting", while the episode title was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a> ("Lucy Is Enceinte"). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">And now you know.</a></p><p>After the regular series ended in 1957, the cast carried on with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LucyDesiComedyHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LucyDesiComedyHour">The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour</a></em> specials &mdash; essentially double-length "I Love Lucy" episodes with greater emphasis on famous guest stars and exotic locations. These are often considered to be inferior to the original series, and the later episodes particularly suffered from the rapid deterioration of Lucy and Desi's marriage &#150; they divorced shortly after the final <em>Comedy Hour</em> episode wrapped. Over the following decades, Lucy was able to carry on the premise (if not the exact same character) on her own with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLucyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLucyShow">The Lucy Show</a></em>, <em>Here's Lucy</em>, and <em>Life with Lucy</em>.</p><p>In short, this show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">responsible for more tropes</a> than anything on television before or since (excepting perhaps <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, which by the way was <em>also</em> originally produced by Desilu Studios). As noted above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReRun">it has not stopped airing</a> since October 15, 1951. The <em>entire reason</em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook">The Oldest Ones in the Book</a> super-index has a cutoff date of November 8, 1960, is to include the complete first run of this pioneering series (which, including the <em>Comedy Hour</em> retool, lasted until April 1 of that year).</p><p>Since 2013, CBS has begun to air some of the most iconic episodes in color, usually around the holidays. However, the black and white versions remain widely available on home video, and in other channels' reruns.</p><p>Has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ILoveLucy">character page</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ILoveLucy">Recap page</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeedsWikiMagicLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeedsWikiMagicLove">Needs Wiki Magic Love</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This show provides examples (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">often the very first examples</a>) of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive">555</a>: This show simultaneously uses yet predates it &#150; the modern American telephone system only came into being four years earlier, and took still longer for its effects to percolate down.

Really the most he ever did was spank Lucy, and it was played for laughs as if she were a child.

Notable is the Christmas special, which aired on CBS in 1990 and 2013 onwards colorized. Interestingly, its flashback sequences were presented in their original black and white for the first two colorization jobs, while 2015 saw CBS air the entire special in color. "Lucy Goes to Scotland" was also colorized as a bonus feature for the 2007 <em>I Love Lucy</em> Complete Series DVD. However, the episode was originally supposed to be filmed in color, but the studio couldn't afford it, so the episode was colorized based on the color home movies shot by Desi Arnaz. When CBS televises the colorized Christmas special, they follow it up with a color version of an iconic episode - such as "Lucy's Italian Movie"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29l7q');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note29l7q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29l7q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Colorized in 2011 for the <em>Essential I Love Lucy</em> DVD Time/Life released in honor of the show's 60th anniversary</span>, "Job Switching", "Lucy Does a TV Commercial", or "Lucy Gets In Pictures" - to pad the timeslot to an hour. May 2015's <em>I Love Lucy Superstar Special</em> features color versions of "LA at Last!" and "Lucy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">Superman</a>". May 2016's <em>Superstar Special</em> applies this treatment to "Lucy Visits Grauman's" and "Lucy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>". The high ratings of the colorized airings in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> eventually prompted CBS to color other black-and-white sitcoms in their library.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetRichQuickScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetRichQuickScheme">Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</a>: Lucy would form these on occasion, but not out of simple greed. Usually it was because she had spent too much of her allowance and Ricky refused to give her any more.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a><ul><li> In "Ricky and Fred are TV Fans," Fred and Ricky are glued to the TV set for a boxing set. When Fred runs down to the corner store in between rounds, Ethel says, "You know, he's got himself trained so he can do anything in less than a minute." After a hearty laugh from the audience, Lucy glumly tells Ethel that she knows exactly what she means.</li><li> One episode has Lucy and Ethel posing as survey-takers to confront a woman they think is having an affair with Ricky. The woman asks if their name is "Kinsey", which was the name of a famous sexologist. Considering the show couldn't have Lucy use the word "pregnant", it's odd they were allowed to reference Alfred Kinsey's name.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsVsBoysPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsVsBoysPlot">Girls vs. Boys Plot</a>: Happened very often. The first few minutes of several episodes set up a conflict between Lucy and Ricky based on some stereotype (men being slobs, women being unable to manage money, etc.), with Fred and Ethel getting dragged into the scheme along gender lines as well. The two groups would then compete to prove their individual points, often resorting to increasingly convoluted gambits against each other to win. In a mild subversion of this trope, the women didn't always come out on top&#151;Ricky and Fred were just as likely to come out ahead in the conflict of the week as Lucy and Ethel were. A few famous examples:<ul><li> The best-known episode that uses this trope is probably "Job Switching." Ricky and Fred claim that having a career and earning money is the hardest work imaginable, and Lucy and Ethel counter that running a household is no small feat either. The two groups agree to trade jobs for the day, with the men trying to keep house and cook and the women getting jobs in a chocolate factory. When disaster strikes on both ends, they realize that neither group has it easier than the other.</li><li> In "Equal Rights," Lucy and Ethel demand equal rights regarding money and household affairs. Their request works too well when the quartet goes out to dinner&#151;Ricky and Fred ask for separate checks, and since their wives don't have any money, they end up having to Work Off the Debt by washing dishes in the kitchen. They later get back at the men by claiming that robbers are holding up the restaurant, prompting them to run down and "save" them.</li><li> One of the first episodes, "The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub," centers on this. The group can't decide how to spend Fred and Ethel's wedding anniversary: the men suggest a trip to the boxing ring for the prizefights, while the women would rather go dancing at the Tropicana. After both groups claims that they'll go to their preferred event with some new dates, Lucy calls up a friend of hers who knows every bachelor in town. When Ricky calls the same woman, she sides with the girls and fills them in on the plot. Lucy then hatches a Zany Scheme: she and Ethel disguise themselves as hillbillies and pretend to be the "bachelorettes" that Ricky wanted.

While this is believable for Fred, it is incredibly out of character for the usually dapper, suit-wearing Ricky to want to go around looking like a bum. The reason for his unusual behavior in this one episode is that the story was drawn from Lucy's radio play <em>My Favorite Husband</em>.

Rumor has it that <em>no one</em> got along well with William Frawley, who played Fred Mertz. He was just generally difficult to work with. Vance especially hated him, and the feeling was mutual.

The syndicated version of the episode retains scenes of Lucy wearing the costume and holding cigarettes, but cuts parts where she actually refers to the brand by name. Surprisingly, CBS kept those parts when they aired the colorized version of the episode in December 2015.</li><li> One episode with a scene of Fred and Ricky meeting and eating at a stationary/luncheonette counter features a cardboard standee of the Phillip Morris bellhop in the background.</li><li> This exchange as pregnant Lucy keeps changing potential baby names.<div class="indent"> <strong>Lucy</strong>: I always liked 'Phillip' if it's a boy...</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Ricky</strong>: And 'Morris' if it's a girl?</div></li><li> In the episode in which Lucy insists on a second wedding ceremony due to a typo on the Ricardo's wedding license, the hotel owner who is the small town's Justice of the Peace, the Sherriff, and Gas station Attendant is apparently also the Bellhop.

Execs wanted to adapt the series almost wholesale because it tested so well, whereas Ball and Arnaz wanted to take things in a different direction (and use the series as a vehicle for improving their marriage). Even though the shows have different characters, some episodes of <em>I Love Lucy</em> reused storylines and gags from the radio show, since they shared three writers (Jess Oppenheimer, Bob Carroll, Jr., and Madelyn Pugh). After <em>I Love Lucy</em> became a hit, CBS tried to make lightning strike twice by adapting <em>My Favorite Husband</em> itself as a TV show (with a different cast and crew), but that show went nowhere and was soon forgotten.<ul><li> Another reason Ball and Arnaz abandoned <em>My Favorite Husband</em> &mdash; that series was based on the novel <em>Mr. and Mrs. Cugat: The Record of a Happy Marriage</em> by Isabel Scott Rorick. In fact, the lead characters were named George and Liz Cugat for the first 20 episodes. Their last name was changed to Cooper to avoid confusion with bandleader Xavier Cugat and his wife (Oppenheimer also felt the name Cooper made the characters more down-to-earth and relatable, and reportedly the sponsor found Cugat too ethnic).

A typical dinner in the Ricardo's apartment would see Lucy and Ricky seated at opposite ends of the table, with the Mertzes seating side-by-side facing the audience. In the Connecticut episodes, they would all tend to crowd along one side of the circular dinette table. Oh well, the Mertzes were close friends after all!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a>: Besides the above, much of the show's plot is driven by Lucy's tries to be financially independent. Also, much is made of Ricky's bad English and most modern parenting experts would recommend he speak to Little Ricky in Spanish since infants can learn two languages as easily as one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest">Special Guest</a>: Frequently, particularly when Ricky went to Hollywood and some movie or TV star &mdash; like John Wayne or George Reeves &mdash; would appear on the show.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spexico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spexico">Spexico</a>: Lucy seems to think Cuban culture is a mixture of Mexico, Spain, and <em>Brazil</em> of all places.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLucyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLucyShow">The Lucy Show</a></em>, <em>Here's Lucy</em>, <em>Life with Lucy</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Springtime for Hitler</a>: An attempt to stop people from ordering Aunt Martha's Old Fashioned Salad Dressing with a tv commercial featuring an audience member picked at random (Lucy) dissing the product instead created three times as many orders from people saying "Keep up with the comedy bits!".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>:<ul><li> Subverted.

We're just gonna be back from California in two weeks!"</li><li> Also subverted in that as time went on Lucy got considerably less excited about meeting the Celebrity of the Week.</li><li> The Ricardos' living arrangements were also a subversion.

Not to mention the characters. Ethel played the secretly-a-princess peasant Lily... of the Valley. Fred was Squire Quinn who ran the Inn, down by the River Out. Ricky was rehearsing his song, "I am the good Prince Lancelot. I love to sing and dance-a-lot." When the check bounced and the movers came in to repossess the props and costumes <em>in the middle of the play,</em> no one was really concerned.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Suburbia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Suburbia">Suburbia</a>: The Ricardos and Mertzes move to Westport, Connecticut in season 6.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubwaysSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubwaysSuck">Subways Suck</a>: Especially when you have a loving cup stuck on your head.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles">Swapped Roles</a>: "Job Switching"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a>: Lucy dressed as a man semi-often to further her schemes.

In the 70s the <em>Comedy Hour</em> episodes were syndicated as one hour specials under the title <em>We Love Lucy</em>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickAtNite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickAtNite">Nick @ Nite</a> aired them, they restored the <em>Comedy Hour</em> title (minus the Ford/Westinghouse sponsor tags, of course).

When the Mertzes go home, Lucy and Ricky keep on singing. Just <em>minutes</em> later, the Mertzes call them up and complain nastily about the 'racket', which they were taking part in previously.</li><li> For the Mertzes' wedding anniversary in "The Courtroom", the Ricardos buy their friends a new television set. In an attempt to fix a problem with the picture, Ricky begins fiddling with the settings and wires in the back, and by accident causes it to explode.
