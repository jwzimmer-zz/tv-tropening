He wins a hundred thousand dollars from a Scratch 'n' Win lottery ticket only to get hit by a car during his celebration dance, losing the ticket to the wind and putting him in traction. While he's high on painkillers his promiscuous wife Joy hands over divorce papers so she can run off with Earl Jr's real daddy Darnell. While watching TV, he sees Carson Daly explain the concept of karma.</p><p>It occurs to Earl that possibly the reason his life sucks is because he's been nothing but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> doing bad things to a lot of people, and that maybe he would have better luck if he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">made up for them</a>. To that end he prepares a list of all the bad things he can remember doing, and starts finding a way to make up for them, one by one. Starting on his first item of picking up litter (because he used to litter a lot), he walks to the trash and comes across his missing lotto ticket. This is evidence to him that karma really does work, and he sets out to scratch every item off the list. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek">The Lotto money allows him to focus all his attention on his list</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Most episodes show how Earl deals with one entry on his list, helped (and sometimes hindered) by his friends, most often his simple brother Randy, a new friend Catalina and sometimes even Joy and Darnell. Any given item on his list is likely to be more complicated than a simple "stole 10 dollars" where it causes additional problems for the person involved and Earl goes to extremes to repair the damage he caused. He initially starts out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">karmic fear</a>, but he finds that dedicating himself to the list and doing good things changes him.

Despite this, it does not shy away from many ideas and topics that other shows on that end do. It also adheres more strictly to the concept of karma than straight Idealism, meaning it's a little more realistic and/or cynical than the usual idealistic fare. Many bad things happen to the characters, but they almost always provide character development, and serve an ultimately good purpose.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The show ran from 2005 to 2009 before it was cancelled after four seasons.

The episode ends with Earl sitting on the roof, playing that same xylophone while internally monologuing about not giving up on dreams (like his dream of getting good at the xylophone).<ul><li> In Season 4, one of the items on Earl's list is to get Joy a hottub, because he accidentally cost her a hottub she would have gotten as a reward for tradeshow modeling.

In the end; he decides to stop taking Joy's side and decides it would just be easier to just let the victim go than to keep chasing him, However, the man did remember Joy's identity and she ended up in jail. There are now 2 lessons in this:<ul><li> Atoning for something you did wrong won't always be worth it because your victim will just use your guilt as leverage for their own crimes.</li><li> If you are committing a crime, never settle for maybe and follow it through to the end by tying up any loose ends.</li></ul></li><li> In "Sweet Johnny", Earl directs his attention to a stuntman called Sweet Johnny because he endangered Johnny's life so he can have an affair with Johnny's then-girlfriend, Sheila. Earl finds out Johnny has anterograde amnesia and has been reliving the same day over and over again after receiving brain damage. After stopping Johnny from committing suicide, Earl decides to leave Johnny on the list as a permanent reminder of how bad he can be. There are 2 lessons to this:<ul><li> There are some things you just can't atone for and you will have to make peace with your own guilt.</li><li> You can make things worse by trying to fix it, just use your mistakes constructively and remember what you did wrong so you don't repeat it.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkFallacy">Hard Work Fallacy</a>: Earl gets a promotion from docker to appliance salesman based on hard work and determination, despite teasing from everyone else...and wins their respect.

Then Earl recognizes his car and reveals that he broke the taillight on it (another list item). The broken taillight caused Hash Brown to get pulled over and be late for a deal which ended up turning into a brutal shootout, meaning that Earl had indirectly saved his life. Since this event was what had caused him to take up religion in the first place (he originally attributed it to divine intervention), he thanks Earl and goes back to being a minister.<ul><li> Another person on Earl's list was Donny, a former violent criminal lunatic who found religion while serving two years in prison for a crime Earl committed. Donny forgave Earl almost immediately, reasoning that if he hadn't gone to jail he wouldn't have cleaned up his act (and that he'd have likely gone to jail anyway at the rate he was going).</li><li> Similar to the first example, an early episode had Earl deal with an angry, religious old woman who became a nun after Earl's walkie-talkie hit the same frequency as her hearing aid and Earl pretended to be God, ordering her to do things for him and the others. When Earl revealed the truth, she left the nunnery, gave up on God, and returned to the trailer park, angrier than before.

Then there was the sadistic fast food manager, who managed to have a hot wife and a hot mistress on the side, which caused Earl some doubts about how karma works.<ul><li> Jason Lee sure isn't unattractive, but Earl is portrayed as a slob, wearing the same clothes for weeks on end, his hair always a mess and that enormous mustache. Still, he's picked up several very attractive women, including marrying Joy and Billie.<ul><li> Inverted with Frank and Billie's cousin, and the Earl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage">Fourth Date Marriage</a> to Ralph's mother, especially when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she leaves him for the elderly lead singer of Phish Tahko</span>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny">Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</a>: Earl and Randy arguing about children's show characters, Joy and Darnell about Joy's relatives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncattyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncattyResemblance">Uncatty Resemblance</a>: Every cat in the Camden Cat Show.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">The Unfair Sex</a>: Zig-zagged in "Look Who's Coming Out of Joy," a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a> filling in the details surrounding Joy cheating on Earl with Darnell.

The episode shows that Earl did take the news hard after it sunk in and technically left her for an afternoon before his dad convinced him to stick with a cheating wife and two kids that weren't his. But the interesting thing is his dad didn't really like Joy and only did it so that Earl knew what it meant to take care of someone (and keep Earl from moving back in with him). In hindsight Earl considers it the only decent thing he did before he found karma, and while he and Joy never really loved each other for the time they were together they needed each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateItemSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateItemSwap">Unfortunate Item Swap</a>: Chubby has two guns, a real gun and an identical-looking water pistol he keeps filled with vodka.
