Anathema is given even less description, as the book merely cites that she is renting Jasmine Cottage without ever clarifying where she was *actually* born and raised, and that her features are more &#147;vivacious&#148; than pretty. However, Internet reaction after news of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdriaArjona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdriaArjona">Adria Arjona</a> being cast in the role demonstrated that she was assumed to be a white character simply on the basis of her descent from a British witch.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nrk0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1nrk0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nrk0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The concept that she might be part Hispanic because Agnes&#146; descendents might have moved from England to other areas of the world and married non-white persons was an explanation that had to be repeated multiple times in some social media circles</span>. Both are played by actresses of color in this adaptation. In addition, several celestial beings are played by people of color (not that they have defined races in general).</li><li> God is also gender-flipped into a "She" from the book and the Bible itself, although She is still referred to as "Lord". Some celestial beings traditionally depicted as male are also played by women (Beelzebub, Dagon, Uriel and Michael), and Pollution is non-binary.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: Several extra scenes have been added, such as Episode 3's scenes of Aziraphale and Crowley's relationship throughout history, and minor characters like Hastur, Ligur and Beelzebub have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">larger roles</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satan actually makes an appearance, while in the book his arrival is undone by Adam</span>.

But the bit about any tape left in a car eventually turning into The Best of Queen is never explicitly mentioned.</li><li> One line of prophecy obliquely refers to the Hell's Angels (the one that mentions fish), but they otherwise are neither mentioned nor appear.</li><li> Crowley's methods of causing frustration and inconvenience for lots of people at once (e.g. disabling the cell phone networks during a work day&#146;s lunch hours) are explained early on in the book: his rationale is that putting everybody in an entire area into a worse mood simultaneously has a snowball effect that makes the world a measurably more toxic place overall, thereby doing a lot more damage than the traditional method of tempting people one by one. This explanation is something we only see in his thoughts, though, and is not included in any of his expositive dialogue on screen in the series. This has the unintended effect of making it seem like he&#146;s doing essentially harmless pranks which only *seem* evil.<ul><li> This also changes how his relationship with other demons comes off. Hastur, Ligur &amp; everyone else in the demonic hierarchy&#146;s contempt for him becomes akin to co-workers who are sick of seeing someone who doesn&#146;t put in as much effort as they do somehow skating by, or worse, getting recognition for their non-efforts from the big boss (in this case, Satan) as &#147;innovations&#148; and &#147;big think&#148;, while their more serious efforts go unremarked and unrewarded. Whereas in the novel, Hastur &amp; Ligur and the other denizens of Hell come off as being so behind the times as to be largely ineffective, and Crowley&#146;s methods, which have evolved with humanity, would be a real threat if duplicated by the rest of Hell&#146;s forces.</li><li> It&#146;s also worth noting that, in the series, Crowley doesn&#146;t really try to convince other demons to use his approach to tainting souls and tempting people into sin. He explains his reasoning to them, but when they don&#146;t really get it, he just kind of gives up on them &amp; just relies on the fact that Satan does (and approves of them) to keep the others from skinning him out of pure dislike. In the novel, he&#146;s always trying to get Hell to update their tactics based on the ingenuity of torments that humans come up with to do to themselves (End User License Agreements, for example).</li></ul></li><li> The Them's discussion of aliens spreading a message of universal harmony misses the bit where Adam calls them "sort of g'lactic policemen", but the one who shows up still sounds like a bored traffic cop.</li><li> The scene where Aziraphale lights a ticket attendant's notebook on fire is missing the exchange afterwards (establishing the angel and demon as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>), so it's just a flash of pyrotechnics and viewers who haven't read the book probably assume <em>Crowley</em> did it.</li><li> Aziraphale manages to find a host to possess in England on his first try, unlike in the book where he got bounced between several different people all over the world first.

Between that, his tendency to take credit for evils humanity comes up with all on their own and his tendency to be confounded by his own machinations (e.g. needing to use a pay phone to contact Aziraphale because he disabled the cell phone system earlier in the day), Crowley comes off as more of a cunning trickster than irredeemably evil.</li><li> The miniseries version of Shadwell is significantly less bigoted than his book counterpart was.</li><li> In the book, Aziraphale does not have any contact with any other angels until his conversation with Metatron. When Metatron reveals that Heaven wants the war with Hell, it is a shock to Aziraphale, who had believed Heaven would side with him that the war should be averted if at all possible, and the moment in which Aziraphale decides to rebel against Heaven to stop the destruction of earth and humanity that will ensue. Gabriel is not a character in the original book at all; he is mentioned once by Aziraphale, who was warning Crowley that they didn&#146;t want to attract the archangel&#146;s attention.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4k4qe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4k4qe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4k4qe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Gaiman publicly stated that Gabriel was intended to have a role in the never-written sequel that he &amp; Sir Pratchett had intended to write before the latter&#146;s death, and the character&#146;s inclusion in the adaptation was in honor of that intention</span><ul><li> In the series, Gabriel states almost from his first scene with Aziraphale that Heaven has no intention of doing anything to avert the war, and Aziraphale spends most of the series under the impression that this is just a misunderstanding of their Heavenly mission; that if he can only speak with a Higher Authority, their orders will be clarified and Heaven will stand down from their war footing and stop the Antichrist from starting Armageddon. The scene with Metatron loses much of its impact as a result: instead of Metatron&#146;s insistence that the war is necessary being a metaphorical slap in the face that makes Aziraphale angry/bitter enough to rebel, it becomes nothing more than another exercise in futility like all his other attempts to convince Gabriel to stop the ramp-up to the war had been.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>:<ul><li> The Hell's Angels aren't present in this adaptation, although the prophecy about Four Angels of Hell riding behind the Four Horseman is shown at one point. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">They were in the script, and had even been cast; but unfortunately, the budget and shooting schedule dictated that they had to be left out.</a></li><li> The first episode of the series shows the 3-way baby swap, with Adam being swapped with the Youngs&#146; actual child (baby A) and then the Youngs&#146; child being swapped with the Dowlings&#146; actual child (baby B). There is a line narrated by God that is lifted from the book about the audience imagining that the baby was adopted &amp; wins prizes for his tropical fish as the baby is being wheeled in his hospital bassinette down a hallway, but nothing is mentioned about Baby B again.<ul><li> In the book, Baby B is revealed to be a character known as &#147;Greasy&#147; Johnson, head of Tadfield&#146;s other troublemaking &#147;gang&#148;, the Johnsonites. &#147;Greasy&#148; Johnson and Adam have an implied rivalry as heads of their respective &#147;gangs&#148;, intended to echo sibling rivalry since they were both born on the same day; Adam even &#147;compensates&#148; him for having been taken from his real family &amp; given to the unnamed, unseen Johnsons for adoption in order to bring Adam into the world by inserting an article about American football into one of his fish magazines that was supposed to &#147;change his life&#148;. However, &#147;Greasy&#148; and the Johnsonites are left completely out of the series, and therefore the tropical fish line, like the Elvis scene listed above, becomes something of a non-sequitur.</li></ul></li><li> In the book, there are three aliens that come out of the flying saucer.

The script book has a brief note from Gaiman stating that it works both ways, and Aziraphale <em>did</em> go to Crowley's rescue multiple times over the centuries - they just didn't show it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>:<ul><li> Excluding the whole "Biblical timeline being real" thing, Aziraphale and Crowley are seen wearing some anachronistic outfits during the montage that shows how their arrangement has worked across the ages, including both of them in 16th-century plate armour in Arthurian England. Crowley's AD 41 sunglasses, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">actually do have historic precedent</a> as the emperor Nero is said to have owned a pair of glasses set with gemstones.</li><li> The series keeps to Pepper's mother having conceived (and named) her while she was a member of a traditional hippy commune. It was already stretching it in the book when she was born in 1979, but it becomes this trope when the story now takes place in 2019 and Pepper thus has to have been born in 2008.

This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Shipping</a> trope is also invoked and lampshaded when the demon realizes that the angel is his best friend, and the angel likewise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelsInOvercoats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelsInOvercoats">Angels in Overcoats</a>: Aziraphale wears a nice cream one in his present-day outfit, Sandalphon has a tan one, and Gabriel wears a gray one in a few of his Earth disguises.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyes">Animal Eyes</a>: Crowley the demon quite literally has snake eyes, due to originally being the demonic serpent that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden.

He is visited by the executioner, who brags that Aziraphale will be his 999th "customer" and first Englishman. When Crowley frees Aziraphale, the angel switches clothes with the executioner. The executioner is then mistaken for a prisoner and taken to the guillotine. Neither angel nor demon are disturbed by this development and instead discuss what they should eat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>: Aziraphale tells the Metatron, "You are the voice of God in the same way a presidential spokesman is the voice of the president."

At one point, Ligur tells Hastur that he thinks Crowley is up to no good. Hastur shrugs and says that's all right, he's a demon, he's supposed to be up to no good.

Aziraphale tries to amend that by reminding him that Crowley used to be an angel once but he brushes it off.<ul><li> Later, when Aziraphale tells Crowley of his plan to contact the Almighty and have Her call off Armageddon, Crowley asks &#147;how can someone as clever as [Aziraphale] be so stupid?&#148; Aziraphale, looking incredibly wounded by his oldest friend&#146;s disdain, only responds with &#147;I forgive you&#148;.<ul><li> This could be taken on face value as forgiveness for Crowley calling his idea to contact God stupid, but some in fandom have offered the interpretation that this was an attempt to forgive Crowley more generally in Heaven&#146;s name, referring back to Crowley&#146;s assertion during their confrontation in the bandstand that Heaven will never forgive him his part in the rebellion and that his status as a demon makes him permanently beyond forgiveness (read: salvation).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeRangeChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeRangeChildren">Free-Range Children</a>: No one in Tadfield seems to have any issue with the Them hanging out in the woods and spending most of the day on their own, save for Mr. Tyler of the Tadfield neighborhood watch. Anathema also doesn't think anything of inviting Adam inside for a snack, nor does he think anything of accepting (except for the rumors that she's a witch, but even that doesn't seem to bother him much).

Gabriel placidly replies that there <em>are</em> no back channels, looking confused. She merely smiles and leaves him to contemplate the photos while she calls <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ligur</span>. Since she must have been meeting with him regularly herself over the centuries in order to cultivate a relationship in which they exchange intel, any pictures of her meeting a demon could be construed in the same way she wants the photos of Aziraphale and Crowley to be interpreted. But by telling Gabriel that she wants to investigate Aziraphale&#146;s possible treason through &#147;back channels&#148;, it&#146;s clear that was always her ready excuse for those meetings if they were uncovered.<ul><li> This is also technically how Crowley justified the &#147;Arrangement&#148; to Aziraphale: since their magic comes from the same source and neither Heaven nor Hell can tell the difference when it&#146;s used on humans, Aziraphale can perform temptations on Crowley&#146;s behalf and Crowley can do miracles on Aziraphale&#146;s. When they complete their routine &#147;paperwork&#148;, they can each claim to have done the work themselves even if the other did it, and neither Heaven nor Hell would be the wiser.</li><li> Crowley also takes credit for evil that humanity comes up with on its own this way: since Hell doesn&#146;t believe humans can come up with truly evil things to do to itself without Hellish intervention, Crowley knows they won&#146;t check up on whether he *actually* inspired any of the awful things he&#146;s taken credit for over time. If they did &amp; found he&#146;d been overstating his influence on his reports, he can always claim that since they&#146;re all demons, they&#146;re supposed to lie as a part of being evil.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>: The entire mess starts because of a series of misunderstandings surrounding the delivery of the Antichrist. In order:<ol><li>Arthur Young mistakes Crowley for a doctor and directs him to room 3 to help with Deirdre, not considering that he might be there to attend to the other woman giving birth in the very next room despite the ruckus that Harriet and the Secret Service would&#146;ve made when they came past him on their way in.</li><li>Crowley, distracted and disconcerted by the existence of the Antichrist and the pressure of his role in bringing him into the world, doesn&#146;t question Arthur Young&#146;s identity and assumes that he&#146;s the American ambassador despite the human&#146;s obvious British accent.</li><li>Because of the Youngs&#146; unexpected arrival a week early, the nuns that were expecting Crowley and prepared for the swap are split between Harriet Dowling and Deirdre Young. The only one left to greet Crowley and accept the infant Antichrist is Sister Mary, who was dismissed to the larder before the Youngs arrived and therefore didn&#146;t know there was another couple besides the Dowlings delivering a baby at the time.</li><li>The above leads Sister Mary to believe, just as Crowley does, that the Dowlings are the couple that was delivering in room 3, and therefore that is the room she goes to with the infant Antichrist. She misunderstands multiple verbal cues during her conversation with Arthur Young, including his obvious British accent, and never realizes that she&#146;s not talking to an American ambassador or that she's in the wrong room.</li><li>When Sister Theresa enters the room because she&#146;s realized that Sister Mary has the Antichrist in the wrong room, Mr. Young's presence forces them to eschew verbal communication in favor of <em>winks</em>. Sister Mary interprets Sister Theresa&#146;s wink as a congratulations on having executed the switch and request for confirmation of which child is the surplus baby, while Sister Theresa interprets Sister Mary&#146;s wink as a confirmation of which child is the Antichrist to be switched with the Dowlings&#146; baby in the next room.</li><li>End result, the Youngs end up with the Antichrist, the Dowlings end up with the Young baby, and the Dowling baby gets sent off for adoption.</li><li>Shortly after both sets of new parents leave and the third baby is handed over to his adoptive parents, Hastur takes it upon himself to burn down the convent, destroying all the records and inadvertently preventing anyone from discovering the error until it's too late.</li></ol></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>: One of the key themes of the series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aziraphale and Crowley's love for humanity drives them to try and stop the war; Them's friendship with Adam prevents him from being consumed by his power and gives them the strength to fight the four horseman; Adam's love for Tadfield stops Armageddon and his love for his adopted parents defeats Satan; Crowley and Aziraphale's friendship and love for each other saves their lives against Heaven &amp; Hell.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F-Strike</a>: Happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">three times</a>.<ul><li> Aziraphale goes to great lengths to never utter a swear, which makes his utterance of "Oh fuck!" when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he accidentally walks into his summoning circle</span> a good indication of how dire his situation is.</li><li> Crowley gets the second one when he realises Satan himself is about to make an appearance at the Tadfield airbase.<div class="indent"><strong>Crowley:</strong> This is Satan himself.

In the last episode, Crowley speculates that the <em>real</em> final battle will ultimately be between humanity and its supporters, and the forces of Heaven and Hell working together.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>: Agnes Nutter knew she was about to be burned at the stake... so she filled her skirt with gunpowder and roofing nails.

Anathema is shown growing up in a luxurious mansion on the beaches of Malibu because, as her mother explains, they figured out that the prophecy was given because buying shares in Apple&#146;s IPO allowed &#147;good fortune to tend [their] days&#148;.</li><li> She also, according to Aziraphale in the scene at the church with the Nazis, advised people not to buy Betamax in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">Trailers Always Spoil</a>: The full trailer shows several scenes people who've read the book know come near the end, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aziraphale's bookshop burning down</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Adam almost giving in to his Antichrist self</span>. Also the bit in the trailer where Aziraphale and Crowley toast "To the World" together <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that is the final actual scene of the series.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet">Trash the Set</a>: Repeatedly, and with fire. The TV Companion book reveals that the filmmakers had to construct from the ground up, then burn down, both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aziraphale's bookshop</span> and a life-sized replica of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Bentley</span>.

God&#146;s narration that &#147;it would be nice to think&#148; that the baby is adopted and has a good life, but since the nuns are Satanic (read: evil) and the baby&#146;s fate is never shown, the viewer could interpret that line as an implication that it would be naive fantasy to assume that outcome is what happened. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Book readers know perfectly well that&#146;s exactly what happened, as the eleven-year-old Baby B/Greasy Johnson shows up at multiple points in the story, but he was left completely out of the series after the baby swap in episode 1.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnflinchingWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnflinchingWalk">Unflinching Walk</a>: War strides away with explosions going off behind her at the end of her introductory scene, after successfully turning a peace talk into an imminent battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a>:<ul><li> Many of the things Agnes's neighbors cite as proof she's a witch are <em>helpful</em> things she did, like healing them.

Hastur&#146;s blighted head and the black ooze that comes from it after Warlock is revealed to not be the Antichrist are similarly overlooked by multiple humans. It's not clear if this is because Crowley and other demons with obvious demonic aspects are all maintaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, or if the situation in which these aspects have become noticeable are already so chaotic that no one is calm enough to say: wait a minute, what's wrong with your face/eyes?<ul><li> Likewise, his ranting about falling from Heaven, running away to Alpha Centauri/"off in the stars" and other unusual statements are either shrugged off as drunkenness or metaphor by anyone close enough to hear the conversations.<ul><li> They <em>certainly</em> notice the flaming Bentley though.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityLicensePlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityLicensePlate">Vanity License Plate</a>: Crowley and Young's license plates spell things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">when read backwards</a>. Crowley's is NAITRUC (Curtain), and Young's is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">SIDRAT</a> (TARDIS).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults">Volleying Insults</a>: A substantial amount of Crowley's and Aziraphale's interactions consists of this, with both declaring loudly how little they actually like the other and how evil/good/boring/petty/etc. the other is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">only to then proceed to help each other out in various ways that prove the exact opposite</a>. It drops noticeably as the series goes on, Armageddon keeps drawing nearer and the stakes continue to rise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallPinOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallPinOfLove">Wall Pin of Love</a>: When Aziraphale tries to compliment Crowley by saying he's "quite a nice person", Crowley grabs him by the lapels and shoves him into the nearby wall to snarl that demons are <em>not nice</em>. Instead of being intimidated, Aziraphale simply stares at Crowley's mouth while he rambles, until they're interrupted by Mary Loquacious, who identifies them as having an "intimate moment".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> The fate of the third, superfluous baby is never explicitly shown. While God provides two possibilities (either the nuns quietly disposed of him or had him discreetly adopted), a clear answer is never given. In the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was adopted, and after Armageddon ended Adam helped him out a little bit because he still remembered him from when they were babies</span>.</li><li> We never see just where Aziraphale sent the soldier that tries to stop him, Crowley, Shadwell, and Madame Tracy from getting into the airbase. In the book, he gets a short epilogue scene where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wakes up in his childhood bed at the family farm back in the U.S.</span></li><li> The U.S. Ambassador and his family are never seen again after Warlock turns out not to be the child that's supposed to start Armageddon after all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is A Non-Divine?</a>: At times it seems that Crowley and Aziraphale are the only people in Heaven or Hell who care about humans as anything other than pawns in the Great Plan. But even then, Aziraphale is not above tempting humans to sin on Crowley's behalf, and obviously Crowley is dedicated to doing so. Which means that, while they don't want humanity to be destroyed by a celestial war, they aren't suddenly fighting to keep humans from being sorted to one place or the other. They don't particularly care about humans being pawn in *that* game; they just neither of them want to see the chessboard and all its pieces blasted into nothingness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat">Who Will Bell the Cat?</a>: As Armageddon approaches, Crowley and Aziraphale are both aware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">killing the 11-year-old Antichrist</a> could stop the whole thing. Aziraphale isn't up for doing it himself because "<em>I'm</em> the nice one", and Crowley refuses to be personally responsible for "killing kids".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingShield">Wing Shield</a>: Aziraphale demonstrates his angelic niceness by using his wing to cover Crowley's head during a rainstorm outside the Garden of Eden. Crowley, who has perfectly functional wings of his own, does not return the favor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">The Witch Hunter</a>: The Witch-Finder Army. The only member of the army from the olden days that is seen or described in the series is Thou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer; others are mentioned during Shadwell's monologue after he believes he banished Aziraphale, but only their last names and they aren't given any of the context given in the books. By the time Shadwell meets Crowley in the sixties, he's essentially inherited what's left of the WFA's knowledge, artifacts, records and traditions from his cellmate, Narker, but he adheres to the forms Narker taught him without any real understanding of what they mean or imply. There's no indication that Shadwell has actually ever done anything to actively seek out witches, let alone set them on fire, since inheriting the WFA from Narker: he seems to do nothing more than cut out newspaper clippings and con both Crowley and Aziraphale into paying him an annual wage on the pretext of funding the payroll of an army that doesn't exist.<ul><li> Similarly, Newt is rather mildly horrified at the idea of actually subjecting anyone to the pin test, let alone using thumbscrews or setting people on fire. He's basically in the WFA for the company, especially after meeting and becoming fascinated by Shadwell. He's not even in it for the family connection, since he doesn't know about his ancestor being part of the WFA until Anathema tells him while he's at Jasmine Cottage.</li><li> In the end, the definition of "finding" a witch seems to have shifted for both Shadwell and Newt from "identifying a woman that the WFA rules say we have to set on fire because reasons" to "identifying a woman with whom we can spend the rest of our lives". In the book, Shadwell outright thinks to himself that his retirement with Madame Tracy and Newt's relationship with Anathema means that the WFA is finally officially disbanded.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeOldeButcheredeEnglishe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeOldeButcheredeEnglishe">Ye Olde Butcherede Englishe</a>: All of Agnes Nutter's prophecies are written in the stereotypical "ye"s and we even get to old spelling like "sayd".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>: Crowley enforces this on his plants in a ritual that almost seems to echo the expulsion of rebellious angels (including himself) from Heaven. Any plant that does not meet his standards is taken to the garbage disposal. This makes all the other plants terrified of him, and grow perfectly.<div class="indent"><strong>Gaiman's notes in the script:</strong> <em>The plants are terrified.
