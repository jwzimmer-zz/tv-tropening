However, by far the most famous version of the show is the British version, which was so popular that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEdition">Celebrity Edition</a> was made. Brazil also had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEdition">Celebrity Edition</a> but it wasn't by the same network that held the broadcasting rights to Big Brother and wasn't different enough to avoid being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Screwed by the Lawyers</a>. Said edition was known as "Casa dos Artistas" (House of the Artists). The 2007 version of <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> set the UK record for most complaints about a TV programme, mostly due to the Shilpa Shetty racism row.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The premise is simple: lock several "ordinary" people in house, ply them with alcohol (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">you won't see this aspect much anymore due to the disasters that followed</a>), and watch the results on omnipresent cameras. Viewers can watch the edited highlights in the evening, or watch it live on cable or the Internet. The public then proceed to vote them out every so often.</p><p>The US version notably abandoned the public-voting-out after the first season (the public kept voting out the trouble-makers, who the producers saw as "more interesting" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">and wanted to keep</a>) and went to a more <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>-like system where the house guests vote each other out (which was later adopted by the Canadian version). However, they must vote out one of two contestants nominated by a third contestant who won the "Head of Household" title that week. Therefore, there is less safety in the large, unconcealed alliances you see on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>. The change also meant that the show didn't have to manufacture drama purely by casting the looniest people alive.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A common twist is a "Big Brother goes evil" or "Hell" twist, where Big Brother is psychologically abusive to the houseguests or where they are put in a bad environment.</p><p>Homaged by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E12BadWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E12BadWolf">"Bad Wolf"</a>, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopian</a> future version where the contestants are disintegrated when they're voted out.

Both feature cameos by host Davina McCall. It also inspired the novel "Dead Famous" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenElton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenElton">Ben Elton</a>, which turns the concept into a murder mystery.</p><p>As a reminder to those who want to be on the show, keep in mind it is not a true escape from reality, just a vacation, and many things must be taken into consideration. People who participate in the game can and will be subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a> for the sake of entertainment. When people leave the house, they may find it affects their personal life in a good or negative way as well, because for many, this is their first experience with national television and potential stardom. Those who behave well will find themselves favored by the public and likely to go on to do great things, but for those who act insidiously, they may suffer the critical reception of the nation, predatory remarks in the media, or even workplace termination. Getting a big head on the show is often the worst mistake one can make, as the viewers have proven time and time again that they do <em>not</em> appreciate overly cocky, arrogant and trashy behavior when it exceeds the bounds of reason.</p><p>It's often actually turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Machinima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Machinima">Machinima</a>, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/SBBBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/SBBBrothers">SBB Brothers</a> for just one example.</p><p>Check out and help build the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BigBrother">character sheet.</a></p><p><strong>Not to be confused</strong> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a>'s classic work <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a>,</em> in which Big Brother represents the totalitarian Party that treats free thought as a crime. Its name is, however, based on the fact that in the book cameras are everywhere, with everyone being watched by "Big Brother", which is about all most people (think they) know about it. For information on that trope, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">Big Brother Is Watching</a>.

Even in versions where the public votes to evict, expect a few fan favorites to be voted out early.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation">Audience Participation</a>: Every version of the show tends to have some level of audience input. On the original Dutch format and the popular UK version, evictions (and ultimately, winners) are determined by an audience vote, whereas in the American version <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jm8r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0jm8r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jm8r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">from the second season onwards</span> and the ones that follow it, all evictions and winners are determined by the houseguests themselves. That being said, you'll often have an "America's Vote" poll to determine various factors within the game, most notably "America's Favorite Houseguest", who receives a cash prize in addition to the winner and runner-up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterTheDevilYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterTheDevilYouKnow">Better the Devil You Know</a>: A common strategy for players that are good but not great is to keep said players in the game even when they become a threat. The idea is that when they're in the game they're being targeted by everyone and therefore draw attention away from the other players, whereas if they're eliminated it's only a matter of time before somebody is forced to fill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPowerVacuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPowerVacuum">Evil Power Vacuum</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">Big Brother Is Watching</a>: Inverted.

Wet T-Shirt contest in Big Brother Czech, anyone?</li><li> Big Brother Brasil inserts more of this each year, to the point of suggesting oral sex under the couches. And there always will be a girl who "accidentally" exposes a critical area every now and then.</li><li> Averted in one season of Big Brother Australia; one contestant insisted on wearing a bikini while bathing. So much so that "Jemma in the shower" became somewhat of a IRL Meme.</li><li> The Dutch version contestants were smart enough to see this coming, and spent the first episode having a hot tub orgy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Really</a>.</li><li> In the ninth UK series, Dale and Stuart were given tasks seemingly for no reason other than to show off their torsos.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">Genre Blind</a>: Subverted in versions that follow the American format. Hail Mary attempts to save yourself in the game by convincing an HOH holding the Power of Veto that is targeting you for eviction to take you off and put someone else up often don't work, but many houseguests have continually tried doing this despite the fact that it would take some pretty <em>damning</em> knowledge about another contestant to convince the HOH to turn the target toward that other person to save you. Trying to convince someone else holding the POV to take you off the block instead of keeping the nominations the same has somewhat better odds of success, but not by much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a>: The 24/7 viewing system shows all the things happening in the Big Brother house, so people can deliberately find your characteristic flaws. That means, no one is totally perfect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">Gilded Cage</a>: With the house's homely design, 24/7 viewing system and you will never leave until you're out or you win, it's quite comparable like a luxury prison.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight">Hobbes Was Right</a>: More so in the American format than the original Dutch version, which incentives strategy and manipulation. While there are exceptions, generally the houseguests that do the best are the ones that are ruthless in their gameplay and manipulate others to further their own advancement. By contrast, houseguests who play nice and friendly better be good at competitions, or else they'll either be dominated by the controlling houseguests or find themselves in their crosshairs. Some houseguests try to strike a balance, being friendly while manipulating people, but it's usually for gameplay purposes; they don't want to make enemies and need allies to play the numbers game when it's time to evict.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAllusionTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAllusionTitle">Literary Allusion Title</a>: The name comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>: Given that many versions of Big Brother end up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long-Runners</a>, combined with the fact that almost every major country on earth has had its own version of the show, quite a formidable number of people have spent time inside the Big Brother house. Even within a single season of the show, there can be a large number of housemates to deal with. In most cases the number is kept reasonable (12-14 housemates), but other times all bets are off.<ul><li> While the US version held to the rule of 12-14 housemates for the longest time, recent seasons have seen 16 becoming the default number. <em>Big Brother 17</em> currently holds the record for most housemates on the US version of the show, with 17, appropriately.</li><li> The UK version of the show, on the other hand, has shown no qualms with stuffing as many people into the house as possible.

As of 2020, the American version is the longest-running one of them all, airing more than twenty seasons over two decades.</li><li> Seasons 5 and 6 of <em>Big Brother Germany</em> deserve a mention for being long-runners unto themselves: they both lasted for <em>one year</em> before a winner was finally crowned. It was estimated by Guinness that the 24/7 broadcast of the house for season 5 currently holds the record for longest uninterrupted live broadcast.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>: Frequent.

One made up of the "underdogs", the other made up of "populars". Notable examples are Team Richard vs The Plastics (series 7), B Block vs The Whisper Club (series 9), and The Insiders vs The Outsiders (series 13, ironically, The Outsiders were much more popular with the public).</li><li> In Big Brother 2004, the house featured Marco's Harem (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Marco</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">Michelle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit">Nadia</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Emma</a>) vs the Jungle Cats (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Victor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jason</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear">Ahmed</a> and honorary member Stuart). The two factions, for the most part, hated each other and had a massive difference of ideals - the Harem were camp, loud, and always up for a party, while the Cats were serious about the game, moody, but more mature than the harem. The conflict between these two came to a magnificent climax on the legendary Fight Night, on which Jason threatened to knock Marco's block off, Nadia slapped Jason, and Emma and Victor threw platters at each other, resulting in Emma being thrown out of the house.</li></ul></dd></dl></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>: One who fits the trope closest was Grace in series 7.

She had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> after hearing the audience loudly chanting "Get Grace Out!". It later became tradition for an unpopular housemate to have their name chanted in such a way, but at the time it was a shock to all the housemates that one of them could be so disliked by the public, not least Grace herself who sobbed that she had never been unpopular in her life.<ul><li> Helen Wood from BB15 and 16 embodied this trope TWICE! Her confrontational behaviour in BB15 caused her to receive multiple formal warnings for bullying and threatening other housemates. Viewers were ultimately shocked when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">won the show</span>. In BB16, Helen returned as a Time Warp housemate and displayed much of the same confrontational behaviour, arguing with Nikki Grahame and calling Brian Belo a 'paedophile' and a 'rapist' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leading him to walk out of the show</span>.

In a task he was fooled into thinking a phony talent agent was really interested in signing him, which saw him doing a photoshoot for a cheesy calender and saying that Ashleigh annoyed him and when he left the house he would rather be a player than in a relationship. Later he overheard Ashleigh complaining that he smelt of onions and implying that she fancied Conor more. Worst of all, he and Conor were in the White Room task and were told that if one of them pressed a button they would win &pound;50,000 but would have to leave the house immediately and the other would get a free pass to the final. Conor had said a few days before that getting to the final was the most important thing to him, but he pressed the button a split second before Luke S, leaving him crying and kicking the furniture in anger. It didn't end there either.

They had sex several times in the house, much to the disgust of both housemates and viewers. On one particular occasion, Steven was heard telling Kimberly to "open it" leading to numerous internet memes and jokes from presenter Emma Willis.

The First Five alliance was in clear control of the house, and everyone else in the house was either too scared or two incompetent to make any kind of move against them. It was clear that the group was going to eliminate everyone else in the house and make it to the final five if nothing in the situation changed, which makes for pretty boring television.

Godfrey and Jordan were on the block, with Jordan connected to Zach who held control over most of the house (he had Bruno, Willow, and Ashleigh; Ashleigh had Pilar and Kevin). In order to get rid of lynchpin Jordan and keep Godfrey (who had publicly declared his intentions of removing Zach the next week), SSB (Sarah, Sindy, and Britnee) teamed up with Bruno and Bobby even though the two had been going head to head for the past few weeks.

Godfrey talked very little game unless he had to (spending most of his time relaxing and flying under the radar), was on civil terms with every house guest and member of the jury, and though he made his targets clear he was always able to get someone else to get them out in order to avoid bloodying his hands.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignExchangeStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignExchangeStudent">Foreign Exchange</a>: In series 4, Big Brother arranged for one housemate to swap with a another from Big Brother Africa for a few days, which was running at the same time.

No, that wasn't a joke.
