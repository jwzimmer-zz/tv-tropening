Network</a>. It is similar in format to <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em> and it revolves around the lives and careers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WWEDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WWEDivas">WWE Divas</a>. The women the show focuses on are:</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a></em> - Nikki and Brie, twin sisters.

They do most things together but episodes explore the differences between them such as Nikki's body image issues and Brie's desire to move away. In 2014 Nikki became the first cast member to win the Divas' Championship while the show was airing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ae26');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ae26" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ae26');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A long standing rumour was that cast members couldn't hold the title due to the time difference of when episodes eventually air.</span> And upon the title's retirement in 2016, that makes her the only one too.

Like the twins, the show explores the differences between them - Trinity being more about the in-ring athleticism and Ariane being more about the glamour and character. Trinity has been removed and re-inserted from the cast several times, while Ariane was removed in Season 3 and got released in 2016.</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart">Natalya</a></em> - Nattie Neidhart, third generation Diva and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSister">Cool Big Sister</a> to the rest of the cast.

TJ's mother phones them and demands they stay at her house (where she would make TJ sleep on the couch and Nattie share her bed). TJ caves and goes to her house, while Nattie refuses and stays in the hotel. When his sister makes an appearance later in the episode, this trope happens to her instead.

There have been moments of antipathy between her and some of the other Divas since the show started, but those were relatively spread out and called for what they were, leading to more humanizing bonding moments (see the "Ariane outing Eva's past alcoholism" situation). In general, it seems that her arrogance of the first couple of episodes has given way to a more reasoned, relatable woman who's formed something of a bond with her more experienced coworkers.

Of course in this case it's quite justified since WWE's tests are designed to catch wrestlers out when they're using drugs on the road. And it's ultimately a subversion since Paige confesses it was just a joke - and any drug test Nattie takes would of course confirm that anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerVersusFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerVersusFamily">Career Versus Family</a>: Trinity alludes to this in the first episode.

This might get explained when you remember that a very expensive, drawn-out, and frustrating home renovation had a lot to do with Cena's marriage coming apart. It doesn't completely excuse his behavior (he seemed especially ungrateful when Nikki cooked for him and acted like he didn't want the kitchen to ever be used for cooking at all,) but you can at least understand where he's coming from if you realize he might not be wanting history to repeat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing">Corpsing</a>: Nattie and Ariane/Cameron get into an argument while out drinking.

Trinity's father comes to stay with her and Jon but oversteps his boundaries (and Trinity is reluctant to tell him). Eva also struggles with her father not approving of her relationship with Jonathan.

Ariane is told that she may just become a valet to Trinity and debates about whether or not to go back down to developmental for more training - and therefore losing her main roster spot.</li><li> Nikki is also worried about this - when Brie gets a singles push while she's injured.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>: The twins' father who split from their mother when they were fifteen.

The Funkadactyls Cameron and Naomi are called by their real names - Ariane and Trinity. Natalya is often just called Nattie onscreen anyway - and likewise 'Jojo' is just a nickname for Joseanne. The Bellas are referred to as 'The Bellas' as if it's their real name (though Bryan does use Brie's real last name Garcia when he proposes). Eva Marie's real name is Natalie but is called Eva by everyone (even by Jonathan towards her family) - though her family does say Natalie a couple of times in the season 1 finale. Summer Rae is also called by her ring name rather than her real name Danielle. Alicia, Paige and Rosa are also called by their ring names, though the former is referred to as "Fox" or "Foxy". Most other WWE workers get called by their ring names save for a few.</li><li> If you listen closely at one point during Paige's debut episode, Nikki calls her "Raya". Some of her friends call her by her real name of (Sa)raya-Jade Bevis.</li><li> In an episode with an Alicia Fox/Rosa argument, a suddenly serious Alicia refers to the latter as "Roucka", her last name. Occasionally Alicia refers to her as "Rou" for short.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> is likewise called by his ring name (likely due to <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

They refer to their Catholic faith when they find out Eva eloped with Jonathan. She retorts that they've been living unmarried with their girlfriends for years.</li><li> Brie likewise illustrates a double standard between Nikki and their brother. JJ accidentally texts a naked selfie of himself to Nikki. She's with their cousins at the time and shows everyone to have a good laugh. Brie and JJ try to explain to her why that is <em>not</em> okay. And to get revenge Brie uploads a very personal Valentine Nikki wrote to John to her instagram (against her will).</li><li> Fans have pointed out Paige's resentment of Eva due to her being a pretty face who does not know how to wrestle, despite being close friends with Rosa Mendes, who isn't the greatest wrestler herself despite being in the business <em>much longer</em> than Eva. Justified as Rosa is more or less a valet who, whenever she wrestles, is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">Jobber</a> while Eva is being groomed into a top spot <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4wsmk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4wsmk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4wsmk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Particularly the Bellas', who were at the time planning to leave.</span> within the Divas division.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male</a>: Averted.

As this came before her retirement in early 2017 (thus possibly making this her final appearance), it fits.<ul><li> Eva's final appearance in Season 6 is her being suspended for a Wellness Violation, effectively removing her from the 6-Woman tag match at Summerslam. She would then wait out the rest of her contract before officially leaving WWE (and the show).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen">Drama Queen</a>: Maryse comes back to WWE with a three-year-old grudge and desire to stir up trouble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a>: It's not uncommon for a Diva to appear in an episode before she's added to the main cast.

Starting with Season 2, they just show the title graphic.</li><li> Season 1 also referred to most of the cast by their real names instead of their ring names. Eva Marie was the only one called by her ring name. Pretty much everyone gets called by their ring names starting from Season 2. This is referenced with those who debuted in Season 1 - as Ariane's title graphic will say 'Ariane/Cameron' for instance.<ul><li> In early seasons Nikki's title graphic would show "Nikki." In later season, it would show "Nicole."</li></ul></li><li> Nattie was portrayed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> and a responsible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> in the first season. Starting in the second season, relationship drama with TJ escalated and she started having rivalries with the newer Divas - completely at odds with her portrayal in the early episodes.</li><li> Season 2 was the only season to have the incidents on the show used to set up matches on Raw the next night. Presumably due to the difficulties with the set-up - Raw is taped live and <em>Total Divas</em> tapes months in advance - this was phased out in Season 3.</li><li> Lana stayed in character when she appeared in Season 4, and she can be heard doing her Russian accent when Paige meets her in the bar.

She went the same colour as Eva - redhead.</li><li> Eva Marie also complains about Jojo trying to use singing to get on the show, accusing her of not really caring about being in WWE for the wrestling. In the first two episodes, Eva Marie says she doesn't want to train or spend time learning how to wrestle and tries to get on the roster as Fandango's dancing partner, and throughout season 1 she takes opportunities to get on the show as a valet and as a ring announcer rather than as a wrestler.</li><li> This is a reoccurring issue with Nikki. She is hurt over John hiding that he has a sex scene in his movie despite being guilty of hiding things from him herself. Also, she was pissed at Brie for interfering with her relationship with John. Only a few episodes later she's trying to interfere with Brie and Bryan's sex life.

When she's finally taken to a counselor, they perform an exercise where she describes what she sees in a mirror to a sketch artist, and then the counselor's co-worker does the same.

When JJ subsequently compliments John on his reaction to the news, Nikki gets upset at him for telling John whilst both of her siblings point out that Nikki had said she was going to tell John <em>and</em> that she had told him.<ul><li> Ariane has this attitude towards the new gear fiasco in episode 2.

The "Somethin-somethin'" is yet to be revealed.</li><li> Season 3 trailers featured a tense discussion between Mark Carrano and Ariane where he says "you won't be a Diva any more". Of course in the actual episode, it's a hypothetical discussion about if Ariane were to go back down to NXT and train.</li><li> Season 3 also showed Brie asking to borrow money from Nikki and John, making it seem like she was struggling financially. In the actual episode she only asked to borrow money to help start up a possible B&amp;B project.</li><li> Summer going on a date with Gary, a guy Rosa had been casually seeing, is hugely hyped up. A big deal is made of a clip of Rosa saying "I am this close to hitting her" and it's even used as a Cliff Hanger Twist Ending. Aside from one minor altercation between Rosa and Summer, it's immediately forgotten about - and Rosa has already moved onto dating someone else.</li><li> A really egregious example when it comes to TJ's photo shoot. Nattie is shown being a little uneasy about the sexy female models posing with her shirtless husband. Previews for the rest of the episode have Nattie seemingly saying "I need to shut this party down." Of course when the clip actually airs, what Nattie really says is that her old self would have shut the party down - and she learns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>: Daniel Bryan Danielson, of course.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>: Brie wanted to get a bus, after seeing Nikki's and John's bus and managed to talk Bryan in to it by getting the rest of the cast to join them.

The amount of 6-Diva tags make more sense when they show up as necessary stock footage in season 2.</li><li> When WWE did their annual "spring cleaning," a number of mass firings that occur every year right around <em>Wrestlemania,</em> one of the more surprising firings of 2014 was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Aksana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Aksana">Aksana</a>, who had had several matches recently on television and was involved somewhat in a storyline with the Divas Champion Paige. It was suspected at the time that Aksana was fired over Rosa Mendes (who was never a major player in the Divas Division to begin with, having never won a televised match by her own admission, and had made almost no appearances on TV for months,) because the producers at E! wanted Rosa for <em>Total Divas.</em> Later confirmed when she joined the cast for Season 3.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek">One-Hour Work Week</a>: It can sometimes come across this way, as the girls will more often be shown at home and having plenty of time to have lunch and socialise - despite being on the road for most of the year. Of course this is all down to editors only showing the times the girls do have time to do fun stuff - as showing the girls on planes and long car journeys isn't very exciting TV.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Averted with Nikki's boyfriend John Cena, Trinity's boyfriend-turned-husband Jon Fatu, and Eva's boyfriend-turned-husband Jonathan Coyle. Also Josie is the name of Eva Marie's mother and of Brie's pet dog. Played straight in the sense that Eva Marie's real name is Natalie. She is referred to by her stage name the entire time, presumably to avoid confusion with Natalya &#151; whose real name is also Natalie (though is always called Nattie).

He gets up and walks away from Nikki while answering a phone call from a woman. He closes his laptop and locks his phone whenever Nikki might see. And most damning of all, he lies about paying a visit to the gym when in reality he was nowhere near it. In the meantime, Nikki has passed her real estate agent's exam and was showing clients a high-end beachfront home in San Diego. After confronting John about her suspicions, she heads off to her new job thinking to resolve things later, but then John shows up at the property she's showing. He tells her, "There's no other way to say this. I went to see another woman. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her name is Sarah.

The show presents it in a way that we're supposed to take Nattie's side, but the facts speak for themselves:<ul><li> She abruptly dislikes Summer Rae for no real reason other than that she thinks Summer is being fake. While Summer does act like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>, half the time she's responding to a taunt from Nattie.

While TJ is admittedly a little clueless when it comes to being romantic, Nattie reacts to everything by blowing up at him.

What's odd is that WWE TV presents Tyson Kidd as the heel, playing the aloof husband to Natalya's good wife. On the show it seems like it's the other way around.</li><li> And after Paige plays a prank on her, making her think she's eaten a pot brownie. Bear in mind that once Paige realised how much Nattie was freaking out, she immediately confessed and apologised. She also said she would pay for the damage suffered to Nattie's car as a result.

Culminates when Summer makes an unannounced visit to Nattie's house, get the apologies out of the way, and then starts in on accusing Nattie, <em>in just the sweetest voice</em>, of being threatened by the new crop of Divas and of wasting years of her own career. When Nattie comes back with a dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a> of exactly why the rest of the women's locker room doesn't care for Summer and her antics, Summer slaps her right across the face.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>: Nattie is portrayed as this in Season 1, but that trait vanishes by Season 2.

When they're trying to choreograph some new dance moves for themselves, Trinity favours fancy looking dance steps - while Ariane wants to incorporate personality and sex appeal. Of course Trinity may be a trained dancer - but Ariane isn't and the routine has to have them both in sync.<ul><li> The show arguably has the cast divided into these two, with some girls being better wrestlers and others having more character. Nattie and Trinity would lean towards the Technician side - being gifted technical wrestlers and very athletic. JoJo would likely fall under Technician too, if one looks at clips of her training and snippets of matches; she is quite athletic. Divas with less ring experience but more character would include Ariane and Rosa. The Bellas would have begun the show as mainly Performers but notably improved their wrestling <em>a lot</em> to qualify for the Technician side too. Summer Rae is shown to have talent in the ring but is primarily known for her character and sex appeal - making her more of a Performer.</li><li> The newer Divas would avert this. Alicia Fox was brought in as a Performer but has wrestled long enough to be considered a Technician too. Paige meanwhile is a trained Technician from the British independents - but is popular mainly for her gimmick, making her a Performer as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeetotaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeetotaler">The Teetotaler</a>: Eva Marie doesn't drink, and we've seen a couple examples of it. First during the house warming party she and Jojo had for the rest of the cast, then when they where in Vegas for Nattie's bachelorette party; she hung out with Jojo, who was too young to drink. It's revealed in season two that she is a recovering alcoholic. Rosa is this of course, since she's also a recovering alcoholic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenTrio">Token Trio</a>: An all-female example.

Paige is probably a literal example - known for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RavenHairIvorySkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RavenHairIvorySkin">Raven Hair, Ivory Skin</a> against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlonde">Dark-Skinned Blonde</a> Caucasian girls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>:<ul><li> Eva Marie, particularly in the first few episodes. There is a whole list of infractions that would get almost any other wrestler in the company released if it weren't the show's resident crash test dummy doing them:<ul><li> In the pilot episode, her very first impression with WWE creative is to completely disregard their instructions on her hair color <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9egwe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9egwe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9egwe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She admittedly had a point. Going in, she has an already sexy and distinctive brown color with red highlights and was told to dye her hair blond, which would do absolutely nothing for her complexion. Instead, she went with Rhianna fire station red, an improvement over blond but still a downstep from her original color.</span> .</li><li> Next, she wanted to take a shortcut to get on camera by insinuating that she has a background in ballet and ballroom dancing in order to get an on-screen position as Fandango's escort/manager. A fair amount of planning goes into this until she has her audition and fails miserably, after not even bothering to use the time leading up to the audition to get a single dancing lesson. Fandango himself looks fairly disgusted with the whole affair, the creative staff is flabbergasted and has to find a replacement for the dancer role, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> herself takes Eva to task for wasting so many people's time. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10pu2n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10pu2n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10pu2n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Stephanie's on-screen anger is mostly staged, but Eva didn't know that at the time. Still, as the person in charge of the creative division, she had to have been pissed to some degree at Eva for causing such a distraction.</span></li><li> In an attempt to throw something against the wall to see if anything would stick, Eva was given a ring announcer's role for a match during Raw. Despite having most of a week to memorize a half dozen names and billed locations, she still mangles a lot of names, including "Ginger Mahal" in 3MB, which to him is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11nbn1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11nbn1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11nbn1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This makes sense. He is an entirely disposable mid-carder who might be dropped at some point and never be seen again, so every television appearance he has is valuable. So someone butchering his name, to him, is showing him a distinct lack of respect.</span></li></ul></li><li> Eva finds out she might have silicone leaks in her implants - and continues to wrestle. She doesn't finally take time off to get them removed until the Bellas call her out on it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">Trailers Always Spoil</a>: The first episode really tries to wait until the last minute when it comes to Eva's hair situation. They try to keep it a mystery as to whether or not she will go blonde. Except every single trailer showed Eva with her red hair. This also undermines the whole 'will the office like it?' mystery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a>: Bryan Danielson had to go through one while the show was airing. His father passed away, he suffered a career-ending injury and had to retire after a lengthy absence.

What's more is that Eva revealed in an interview that she had literally gotten her hair done the day before. The office had asked her to streak her hair - and then weren't happy, so they then asked her to go blonde.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGirls">Those Two Girls</a>: Three pairs of them, in fact.

She refuses to apologise to Sandra for going behind her back to get new gear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">The Unfair Sex</a>: The series likes to play up relationship woes whenever they appear, presenting them in a way that attempts to be sympathetic to the divas' side even if the issues are a bit more even than would warrant the one-sided view. However, because this is a reality show and not a scripted program with clear heroes and villains, it doesn't quite work so well.<ul><li> First we have Nikki and John Cena's relationship. Quite a few fans buy into Nikki's strife of wanting John to commit to marriage even though he's actually being forthcoming with his feelings on the matter.</li><li> Similarly, we have the aforementioned issues between Nattie and TJ. Aside from it coming across as drastically overblown in context, Nattie's myopia regarding their relationship problems became so clearly inconsiderate of her husband's side that it was eventually called out in-universe by Trinity sitting her down and reminding her not to take her frustrations out on the good-hearted man who loves her.</li><li> Then there's the situation between Paige and Emarosa vocalist Bradley Walden. Bradley wanted a relationship with Paige, but she was hot and cold about getting together with him to the point it frustrated him, and shortly after they fought about it it was revealed to be because she'd been hurt in a past relationship. Fox and Rosa convinced her to give him a chance and that he wouldn't be like the person that hurt her, at which point she accepted him. Shortly thereafter she immediately wanted to move in with him, guilting him into it unintentionally yet pushing on after he said yes despite his obvious reluctance. While visting his family, she then found out that he'd already been married in the past and was just as uncomfortable talking about it as he was hesitant in telling his parents of their plans to move in together. Instead of either Paige or the show realizing he didn't want to move too fast into something that could be a repeat of whatever his past marriage was, she threw a fit and accused him of being a whiner and the show has generally taken her side on this. How was this eventually followed up? She would explain the following season that he'd dumped her via text message, essentially writing him off the show as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> ex to the most popular Diva in WWE.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a>: Trinity for her crotch showing - "all my cookies are hanging out".

The see-through catsuit she's wearing rips in the middle of a scene. She also suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairstyleMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairstyleMalfunction">Hairstyle Malfunction</a> during another take.</li><li> Eva Marie gets warned that she's in danger of having one due to her shorts being too skimpy.

Although she's wearing flesh-coloured thong panties, she's hugely embarrassed.

Rosa suspects Alicia, but she says she didn't and they wonder which of the other girls did.

The latter thinks she's eaten a pot brownie by accident, and drug tests are about to happen. Nattie frets that she can't take the test - so she crashes the car. Admittedly it's just into a dumpster and the car is only barely scratched, but Ariane still rightfully calls Nattie out on how insane it was.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a>: The show seems to be mixing this in, making fans wonder what parts are staged and which are genuine.<ul><li> They also do this with the wrestling itself, as much as it's included. Sometimes it seems to act like wrestling is a real competitive sport (e.g. they oddly seem to treat the Daniel Bryan/Cena match like that outcome wasn't predetermined and like the match was "real"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12adgn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12adgn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12adgn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though it could be that the Bellas just didn't know who would be winning</span>), whereas sometimes it sticks more to the worked shoot line of, "Oh, no, wrestling is staged, but this thing that happened in the ring was real," (e.g. Nattie getting mad and actually shoving Naomi/Trinity in their match).
