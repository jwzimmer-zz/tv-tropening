It originally aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LOGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LOGO">LOGO</a> from 2009 to 2016, and then moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a> in 2017.</p><p>The bulk of each episode consists of a main challenge, usually some form of performance or fashion design, sometimes both. Then the queens participate in a themed runway show, where one is declared the winner of that week, while two others are announced to be up for elimination. The bottom two must then compete to stay on the show with a lip sync <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">for their lives</a></em>. These tend to result in wigs falling off, jumping splits, death drops, and the occasional kiss. Sometimes both queens survive the lip sync, but sometimes <em>neither</em> are saved. There was once even a <em>six-way</em> lip sync when one team performed especially bad as a unit. RuPaul's decisions are helped by a judge panel, with its current iteration made up of Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews and Carson Kressley (who alternate on the third judge seat), and celebrity guest judges.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There have been twelve regular seasons of the show, with the series renewed for the thirteenth season. There have also been five seasons of <em>All Stars</em>, featuring returning queens from previous seasons competing for the distinction of being inducted into the "Drag Race Hall of Fame". Additionally, an inaugural <em>Celebrity</em> edition premiered in 2020, with the prize money being donated to charity. A list and summary of all seasons can be found on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RuPaulsDragRace">Recap page</a>.</p><p><em>Drag Race</em> has spawned multiple spinoffs and related programming (see below) and a variety of foreign editions, although only one (<em>RuPaul's Drag Race UK</em>) features Ru as host. A Chilean version, <em>The Switch Drag Race: El arte del transformismo</em>, premiered in October 2015, while <em>Drag Race Thailand</em> premiered in February 2018. In July 2020, <em>Canada's Drag Race</em> premiered on Canada's Crave service, unique in that it has <em>three</em> hosts - US season 11 runner-up Brooke Lynn Hytes, actor Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, and fashion model Stacey McKenzie. Right on the heels of that version, in September 2020 it was the turn of <em>Drag Race Holland</em>, based in the Netherlands and hosted by fashion expert and former drag performer Fred van Leer, with model and actress Nikkie Plessen as a regular judge and alternating judges fashion designer Claes Iversen (who designed the season's grand prize dress), actress Sanne Wallis de Vries, and singer Roxeanne Hazes.

In spite of this, she proved time and time again why she deserved to be there, showing an incredible amount of nerve, wit, and talent all throughout the show, while still being unique in her display of freaky, genderfuck drag on the runway. She won four challenges during her season, a record that stood for many years, and remains one of the most popular queens of all time.</li><li> And Bianca Del Rio, who came onto the show an <em>incredibly</em> seasoned, veteran queen, but still responded to the critiques she received. She brought a high level of professionalism combined with a great sense of humor to every challenge, and holds the distinction of being the only queen to never place low in a challenge.</li><li> In All Stars 3, BenDeLaCreme is so much this trope that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes the first queen to win <em>five</em> challenges<em> in one season, breaking Sharon's record. Having proved herself to everyone, and no longer comfortable with the All Stars elimination format of the winning queens eliminating lower placing queens, she chooses to eliminate </em>herself,'' having accomplished all she wanted to do. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop">reactions</a> of everyone else say it all.</span></li><li> And not to mention, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RuPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RuPaul">RuPaul</a> herself, who has proven time and time again over the past two decades why she is known as <em>the</em> drag queen in American pop culture.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>: This wasn't the first time in Latin America where Johnny Torres hosted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">a reality show</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: Season 9's "Gayest Ball Ever" saw the five remaining queens construct a runway look based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VillagePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VillagePeople">Village People</a></em>, specifically the Cowboy, Construction Worker, Native American, Cop, and Leather Biker. As there were only five queens for this challenge, the sixth member of the Village People, the Military Man (a.k.a.

And both Roxxxy and Alaska's partners looked like they could be contestants themselves. In fact, Alaska's partner Nebraska went on to become an actual drag queen.<ul><li> Sarge, the show's ex-military camera operator, has the time of his life in drag during Season 9's makeover challenge.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePromiscuous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePromiscuous">All Gays Are Promiscuous</a>: Often invoked in the challenges, many of which revolve around the mostly naked pit crew.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">All of the Other Reindeer</a>: Often winds up happening to contestants who for whatever reason don't mesh with the others.<ul><li> Season 2's Mystique was a continual source of ridicule to the other queens for her general lack of polish and her weight. Even after she was eliminated, the queens continued to make fun of her. Tatianna received a similar amount of shade for "not being drag enough"&mdash;she was easily the fishiest girl in her season, but several queens made comments on her basic makeup and simple looks.</li><li> Season 3's Stacy Layne Matthews was constantly ostracized by the other queens for the same reasons as Mystique, exemplified by the queens not just saying they were more talented than her (which is par for the course for Drag Race), but by constantly and almost venomously stating in interviews that she did not deserve to be on the show in the first place. Raja, to her credit, tried to make it up to Stacy in the reunion.</li><li> Madame LaQueer's short stint in season 4 had her as this, being picked last for team challenges twice in a row, and once during an <em>Untucked</em> episode was referred to by the other queens as their season's Stacy Layne.</li><li> <em>All-Stars</em> Mimi Imfurst. Not a single one of the girls wanted to be paired with her during the team ups, and the partner she did get did not hide the fact she was miserable with the outcome. Not only that, the other queens had no problem telling Mimi to her face they did not consider her an All Star and that there were plenty of other queens that deserved her spot more than she did.</li><li> Season 5's Jinkx Monsoon got some of this since her style is much more comedic, but in her own words she tries to deal with it like "water off a duck's back".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: A rule has been implemented since Season 3 that during any "Lip-Sync for Your Life", a queen is no longer permitted to leave the stage during their performance. This was in response to several events, including Mimi Imfurst hefting India Ferrah <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry">over her shoulders</a>, and Carmen Carrera leaving the stage to kiss Guest judge Johnny Weir. In season 7, although the rule was still in effect, Kennedy Davenport performed a mid-air split landing in front of the stage, and successfully avoided elimination. This caused a fair bit of tension with the other queens, even if the fans were not aware of the rule change &mdash; it had never been made explicit on the show (although it <em>was</em> mentioned during the <em>21 and a Half Moments that made us Gag!</em> special).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>: It's not unusual for Mini Challenge or Maxi Challenge prizes to be unique fashion or gift certificates to clothing retailers. However, <em>Drag Race Holland</em> has made one of the grand prizes a couture dress by Claes Iverson, a fashion designer who has made garments for the current queen consort of the Netherlands Queen M&aacute;xima, valued at &#128;18,000 (over US$21,000 or over &pound;16,000).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26ryl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note26ryl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26ryl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This hasn't stopped fans of the original American show from deriding the apparently lower quality prize.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a>: The Reunion special for season 4 built up the whole "WHAT DID WILLAM DO" reveal so much and people seemed to be okay with the answer. That was until it has been pretty much said by everyone that this was indeed not the case. Apparently the reason no one has outright said what REALLY happened is due to a confidentiality agreement. Much later it was finally revealed that the <em>real</em> reason for the disqualification was that Willam had lied to the producers in order to get kicked off, since she had felt the show had done everything for her that it needed to and she had other conflicting scheduled gigs she wanted to attend (an off-Broadway performance to be specific). Presumably this left a <em>very</em> bad taste in the producers' mouths, hence why they've cut all ties with Willam.<ul><li> Willam has since gone on the record as saying the producers wanted to be rid of her for being a "troublemaker" on set by bringing up concerns about safety and the queens' wellbeing. How much of this is accurate and how much is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourGrapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourGrapes">Sour Grapes</a>, we may never know.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: After several weeks of Trinity complaining that the challenges haven't been her style, Bianca straight-up asks her, "What <em>do</em> you do successfully?"

The queens chosen aren't just fan favorites, but they each have a reason to want to redeem themselves: Tatianna, Phi Phi, Roxxxy, and Detox all came across as shady and bitchy during their seasons; Coco and Alyssa were defined by their feud and a string of embarrassing defeats; Alaska was defined by her relationships with others; Adore was constantly read for being unpolished; and while anyone from the much-hated Season 7 would qualify, Ginger's shadiness and Katya's anxiety stood out in particular.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever</a>: Phi Phi O'Hara, Sharon Needles, and Chad Michaels in the video for "Glamazon."

Me! I'm first!"). In fact, her tendency to be an Attention Whore is what got her eliminated from season 3 in the first place - in her lip sync with India Ferrah, Mimi became so desperate to hog the limelight that she forced India up onto her shoulders against her will. Mimi never really lived that one down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">Attractive Bent-Gender</a>: All of the contestants, naturally, but also some of the guys brought in for makeovers. Special mention goes to <a class="urllink" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QM-aRaU6Zmo/TZyOWymlxGI/AAAAAAACcfQ/N-sbkE2pom4/s1600/RPDRE11p2%252B8.jpg">Slava<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, from season three.

Those that aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">hilarious</a>, anyway.

The very beginning of Episode 6 dismantled this, having Ru ask why only three queens were there and the remaining two running onstage afterwards. The popular fan theory is that the show only had five <em>Handmaid's Tale</em> outfits, and Chad and Alaska quickly had to change out of them before the final two queens could enter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen">Bald Women</a>: Many drag queens shave their heads or keep their hair short while in boy mode so that wigs fit better, but several queens like Ongina, The Princess, and Sasha Velour don't wear wigs and actually have completely bald heads as part of their characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>:<ul><li> If you imply that Shangela has not worked for her achievements and/or she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarDaddy">Sugar Daddy</a>, you may get a drink in your face.</li><li> Likewise, don't say that Tatianna is just a pretty face.</li><li> Mentioning that Coco was the runner-up of the Miss Gay America pageant (having lost to Alyssa, before Alyssa lost the title again), and sometimes just Alyssa Edwards being catty in general was enough to cause Coco to go cuckoo.</li><li> Early in season 9, Eureka made a crass joke about eating disorders, prompting Sasha Velour to immediately get snippy with her, since she's dealt with an eating disorder before and she considers it nothing to joke about. This was a bit surprising coming from Sasha Velour, one of the most soft-spoken queens in the show's history.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a>: In Season 6's wedding makeover challenge, while the queens were making over the men into drag brides, the women were whisked away to be fitted for tuxedos from a designer that specializes in masculine suits for feminine body types.

She's all smiles and positive attitude to the other queens during season 9, right up to when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wins the fan vote for Miss Congeniality</span> in the reunion. No longer content to put up with what they now know to be a facade, the other queens start going off on Valentina for, amongst other things, doing nothing to calm her <em>very</em> rabid fanbase who've been trolling the queens on social media, not to mention completely ghosting Farrah, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">who thought they were friends,</a> after production.

The former included a nude illusion challenge and the latter involved shooting Ru's video for the song of the same name.<ul><li> Eureka's final line before leaving Season 9 was "You found it once and you'll find it again" a reference to the Greek translation of her name. On Season 10, her final runway consisted of a dress with the definition of "Eureka" printed on it. Eureka confirmed this was an encapsulation of the beginning and end of her time on <em>Drag Race</em>.</li><li> Season 12's first episode involved a rap challenge called "I'm That Bitch". The final challenge of that season was another singing challenge which included the repeated line "I'm still that bitch".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>:<ul><li> Jade Jolie had this problem. For most of the challenges, she was never the best or the worst, just safe. As a performer outside the show, she's a very skilled and energetic dancer, but on the show she was frequently drowned out by all the loud personalities. She currently holds the record across all seasons for the contestant who went the longest on the show without being either in the top or on the bottom, at four consecutive weeks.</li><li> Chad Michaels delivered perfection in her poise and style, almost to a fault. Near the end of Season 4, Michelle Visage even says she's growing bored of Chad because she always delivers the same flawless presentation, and that it's become predictable.</li><li> Season 9 is often derided as "boring" due to having a relative lack of conflict among the contestants. Many of the queens were making a conscious effort to be nice to each other and avoid getting the Bitch Edit and being <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Miss Vanjie! Miss...Vanjie.&#148;</li><li> Adore Delano's "Party!" was originally the catchphrase of Mayhem Miller, who wouldn't appear on the series until a full four seasons after Delano.</li></ul></li><li> Santino borrows Tim Gunn's "Make it work!" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em> (where Santino got his start) when he joins Ru for a workroom visit in season 7.</li><li> An interesting example is Ru's "she done already done had herses!", often pronounced as fast and garbled as possible. In the countdown episode to Season 7's finale, Ru revealed he stole it from a fast food worker at Krystal Burger in Atlanta in his younger years, who shouted it at a woman trying to take food from the counter that wasn't hers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFellowship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFellowship">Breaking the Fellowship</a>: Rolaskatox gets temporarily broken up after Alaska tries to get some distance from the other two (mostly to avoid being lumped in with them) but they get reformed later on. Eventually broken up for good by Detox getting sent home by Jinkx. Lampshaded in All Stars 2 when all three members are back and Alaska remarks that it doesn't mean the band is getting back together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>: Joslyn Fox idolized Courtney Act prior to season 6, but some harsh critiques and shade from the latter pretty much ended that during the show. Courtney later elaborated that she had no idea her Australian sense of humour sounded so harsh.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>: In general, the competition can reward queens who are successful enough to bring a large wardrobe, but only mildly.<ul><li> This approach backfired on Naysha Lopez, who was eliminated in the first episode of season 8 after saying, "I don't <em>do</em> drag on a dime." Her inexperience with making, rather than buying, her outfits caused her to produce a subpar runway that she also couldn't dance in when it came time to lipsync for her life.</li><li> Hilariously inverted with Bob the Drag Queen, whose chosen look fell apart at the last minute and so she walked the runway in a $25 Amazon.com bought Halloween costume.</li><li> Done literally when Alaska, following a bad performance in All-Stars 2, offered to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayPal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayPal">Pay Pal</a> the winning queen $30,000 not to eliminate her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>:<ul><li> During the Season 4 finale, Willam coined the phrase "RuPaulogize", and Ru immediately stated she was going to steal that line at some point. Come next season, one challenge involves the girls putting on a ballet entitled "No RuPaulogies".</li><li> Roxxxy Andrews, during Season 5's original song challenge, gets called out for saying "sequenced" instead of "sequined" in the song. She's Latina and honestly thought "sequenced" was the correct plural/adjective. Nonetheless, "sequenced" still made it into the final cut and has come back in subsequent seasons.<ul><li> This gets referenced again some All Stars 2, in which Roxxxy pronounced 'sash' (like a pageant sash) as 'shaw' or 'shawl'. When corrected by Michelle Visage, she looks horrified and says "oh god, this isn't another 'sequenced' moment, is it?"</li></ul></li><li> The premiere episode of season 8 featured the girls doing a photoshoot of past winners. Due to not being able to get Bianca to be a part of the photoshoot they instead had a circus clown in her place. Fast forward to episode 9 during the music video filming, Bianca comes in saying she's there to do the winners photoshoot. Mocked again in the finale, when RuPaul brings back the same clown to join the past winners on stage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>: Also called "Reading" or "Throwing Shade" (or sometimes "Throwing Dust"), its when a queen is completely honest in critiquing or just outright insulting another queen on something, which sometimes accidentally (or sometimes, purposely) leading to anger and hurt feelings. Being "Read to Filth" is considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> version of this. Some queens are admittedly a lot better at throwing shade (Bianca Del Rio for instance) than others. The expression "No T, No Shade" (If there wasn't some truth to it, it wouldn't insult) plays on this as well.<ul><li> To be more specific, "Reading" refers to up-front <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>, and "Throwing shade" is a more back-handed or disguised insult.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>: Michelle Visage to RuPaul, although Michelle loves every minute of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>:<ul><li> Before awarding the season 5 crown, RuPaul stops to joke that Coco Montrese had offered to fill in if the winner couldn't fulfill her duties. Coco taking over as Miss Gay America caused her friendship with Alyssa Edwards to collapse and was referenced constantly throughout the season.</li><li> When Jiggly Caliente has to make a parade float and runway outfit using the color orange, she references back to the first episode's challenge when she says she's gone from baked potato couture (having a dress covered in tin foil) to sweet potato couture.</li><li> In Season 2, Tatianna dealt with the critiques that she was just a pretty face in the competition, until she angrily refuses to be considered her season's Rebecca Glasscock.</li><li> In Season 3, Shangela's country look was likened to Season 2's Mystique's "Country Couture" failure.</li><li> In Season 4, Madame LaQueer's large body in tights was compared to Season 3's Stacy Layne Matthews, another big girl who liked wearing spandex.</li><li> In Season 5, Ru makes a joke at Alaska utilizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a>'s famous "eww", Alaska counters it with LaQueer's infamous imitation of the sound. Ru also makes good on her threat to steal Willam's "RuPaulogize" euphemism in titling her ballet challenge "No RuPaulogies".</li><li> In Season 6, during the first walkthrough as RuPaul comes up to greet her, Bianca Del Rio casually mentions that Ru can call her "Jiggly". Ru still uses last season queen Alaska's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catchphrase</a> of "Hiiiiiii" on occasion, as well as referencing the Alyssa/Jade "Backrolls?!" incident. Also, in the "Scream Queens" challenge, the movie's killer was based on Lil Poundcake, a very popular meme from Season 5.</li><li> In Season 6's Snatch Game, Trinity tries to change wigs mid-sketch as a gag. Bianca calls her out on it in the talking head, noting that Chad Michaels used the same gag in Season 4.</li><li> The season 6 finale features the Ornachia Dancers, a tribute to the headpiece worn by Vivacious in the opening episode.</li><li> In Season 7, Latrice Royale Cameos as her Tuckahoe Prison Guard character which won her a challenge in season 4.</li><li> The very first challenge of Season 8 had the queens tasked with recreating a look based on the design challenges from the entire run of the show, including Season 1's "Drag on a Dime", Season 2's "Gone with the Windows", Season 3's "The Queen Who Mopped Christmas", Season 4's "Rupocalypse Now!", Season 5's "Sugar Ball", Season 6's "Glitter Ball" and Season 7's "Hello, Kitty Girls!" among others. Fitting for a challenge that celebrated the 100th episode of the series.</li><li> In Season 8, Derrick Barry revealed that he was in a three-way relationship with Nebraska, Alaska's gay vet makeover from season 5.</li><li> Season 8 included the runway challenge "Night of 1,000 Madonnas" in which several contestants wore duplicative kimono outfits. The following season brought "Night of 1,000 Madonnas II" and there were still two sets of duplicate outfits.</li><li> In Season 8, the black and white runway show was inspired by Detox's black and white look from the season 5 crowning episode.</li><li> In All Stars 2, the two looks in one runway was inspired by Violet's fall look from the season 7 fashion show challenge. Also in that episode, Alaska's second look is based on Lil' Poundcake, her baby pageant creation from a season 5 mini-challenge.</li><li> During the season 9 finale, after Ru asks previous winner Bob to hand over the crown, Bob responds "I'd like to keep it on, please," an infamous line spoken by Valentina earlier that season.</li><li> All-Stars 3 challenged the queens to re-imagine an outfit that was poorly received in their original season.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a>:<ul><li> Many of the contestants fit this at one time or another (and a fair number of the guest judges, too), not to mention RuPaul himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysCamp">You'd expect anything less from a show about drag queens</a>?</li><li> Subverted once in a while as there have been some bisexual queens competing, most notably Scaredy Kat from UK Season 1.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canada, Eh?</a>: <em>Canada's Drag Race</em>, which premiered in July 2020, and wasted little time in playing up Canadian cultural references. The Werk Room doorway has a giant maple leaf around it.

Of course, it wasn't clear if she have actually won that in the spot, or if she was to receive it later. Also, Carmen Carrera casually wore the same model of glove Johnny Weir was using in the last episode as guest judge, when she kissed him. But it was never stated if it was his actual glove or even if she got the idea from seeing his.</li><li> A very minor one occurs in Season 9 that ends up having a major impact on the competition. During the main challenge of episode 2, which involved the queen performing a cheer routine, Eureka briefly mentions in the confessional that she could feel her knee pop after landing a split. Eureka hurting her knee isn't mentioned again for the rest of the episode, and seems to be nothing big... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until 3 episodes later, when Eureka ends up being eliminated for medical reasons regarding the knee injury she sustained during that challenge.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">Chekhov's Skill</a>: It's interesting that mere hours after a conversation between Yara Sofia and Carmen Carrera where we learn that Carmen is Puerto Rican and can speak Spanish, the two are forced to lip sync for their lives to the Spanish version of a song.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>: <em>RuPaul's Drag Race Holi-Slay Spectacular</em>, which was advertised as a Christmas-themed competition one-shot.

These clashes include:<ul><li> Pageant Queens vs Comedy Queens. The most frequent conflict, and the most frequently lampshaded. Pageant queens tend to look down on comedy queens as being unpolished and too silly for their own good, while comedy queens think the pageant girls take themselves way too seriously and are always gunning for a win.</li><li> Veteran Queens vs ing&eacute;nue Queens. Veteran queens will comment that it is unfair that the younger queens are using the competition as a sort of "drag charm school", when the veterans are already so polished and therefore deserve to win more. Conversely, younger queens will comment how veterans refuse to update their style and their more stifled view of drag isn't as fresh or exciting as what an ing&eacute;nue queen can bring to the table.</li><li> How convincing a queen should be as a woman is another hotly debated topic. "Fishy" queens try to look like a natural woman, "camp" queens are the classic larger-than-life caricature, and "genderfuck" queens go for androgyny.</li><li> Season 7 brought a new queen dynamic up for debate, with six previous seasons of <em>Drag Race</em> prior to this one, queens who started their career before the show and therefore had to do things the "old school" way (starting in clubs, finding a mentor/Drag Mother, etc.) vs. queens who started their careers after the show premiered, and therefore were able to use the show as an almost cheat sheet to get a jump start on their drag personas.</li><li> What makes Season 8 unique is that <em>every</em> contestant fills a specific drag niche (Bob is comedic, Dax is a cosplayer, Derrick is a celebrity impersonator, Naysha is a pageant winner, etc.), and almost all of them are at the top of their game. This makes elimination difficult for viewers because all 12 queens are beloved by different sects of the fandom.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing">Corpsing</a>: During the routines of Monet, Monique, and Manila during the Lady Bunny Roast in All Stars 4, Bunny can be seen trying not to laugh while she lays in her coffin.

There are a few instances in which certain contestants perform poorly on the lipsync, but in general the queens are extremely prepared to lipsync to the song of the week, even if they don't expect to be up for elimination.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, as various <em>Untucked</em> episodes have started showing, as we see that the contestants are given iPods with the lipsync songs on them prior to the final judgment.</li><li> Many of the queens employ sewing machines to fix up anything that could meet the challenge.</li><li> Many queens who are concerned that they are in the bottom and will be forced to lip synch will sew in an entirely different costume or hide a second wig, specifically to pull a dramatic reveal.</li><li> Averted in that at least one queen per season has no idea what celebrity to impersonate in Snatch Game, even though this challenge has existed since Season 2.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">Cringe Comedy</a>: Tends to happen on reality TV, but perhaps no more cringeworthy example on this show exists than season 11, when the infamously messy Silky Nutmeg Ganache is teamed with the inexperienced Soju for a design challenge. Every moment of them together in the Werk Room feels like a comedy of errors, starting with Silky's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> face (the first of several) when she realizes Soju can barely even walk in heels. Ru doesn't exactly help when he does the walkthrough and reminds Silky of her recent problem with her padding, and Silky offers excuse after excuse. Frankly, it's a miracle Silky survived this episode.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>:<ul><li> Alyssa Edwards, who is so focused on being a pageant queen that she doesn't do well in competitions involving comedy or impersonation. This eventually leads to her getting in the bottom twice and getting eliminated the second time in a lip sync with Coco.</li><li> Also inverted in the case of queens who have a more comedy/camp style, who frequently get reamed by the judges for not having much in the way of glamour. The queens who seem to do best tend to have a mix of the two abilities.</li><li> Season 7's Miss Fame is so focused on serving model beauty and stunning fashion that she stumbles in everything else, including her lipsyncing. Even when the runway theme was specifically "Ugliest Drag," her dress was appropriately hideous but her makeup, hair, and accessories were flawless like always, meaning she was <em>still</em> beautiful, leading to her elimination.</li><li> Season 8's Derrick Berry is one of the most famous celebrity impersonators in the country, but unlike other impersonators who have appeared on the show, Derrick had difficulty showing more than Britney Spears. Chad Michaels and Coco Montrese both produced a diverse set of looks in their seasons that didn't rely on their chosen celeb (Cher and Janet Jackson respectively).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a>:<ul><li> Though not an official crossover, <em>Drag Race</em> shares a decent part of its viewership with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em>, and viewers of both will recognize Santino Rice (runner up of season 2) and several guest judges who have appeared on both shows.

When questioned about it Yara also claims it's a fairly standard comedic bit in Puerto Rico.</li><li> In season 4's presidential campaign's challenge, Phi Phi O'Hara played Sarah Palin caricature that referred to the two remaining black contestants as "the help".

The "twist" part is lost when Ru does it again for Season 5. Come Season 6, however, she adds tension back to the final challenge by doing it with four queens and eliminating one.<ul><li> In the All Stars 3 finale, Ru suddenly announces that the top 2 is going to be determined with a vote by the six eliminated queens. Despite everyone expecting Shangela (who, after <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLa">De La</a>'s self-elimination, was the frontrunner) to win, the queens vote for Trixie and Kennedy in the final pair.

Yara and Alexis have the "synergy" requirement down, being good friends who work and communicate well together, which nabs them some early praise and a few wins. However, it becomes clear that the team is only as strong as its weaker asset, and Alexis' limitations end up holding them both back, leading to their elimination in the second-to-last team challenge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>: This sometimes happens in the Lipsynch, say if one queen is a dancer and the other isn't, if the song is more one queen's style than the other's, or if one of them is wearing an outfit that constricts her movement.<ul><li> In later seasons, there's often a queen who gets dubbed the "lip sync assassin" after nailing one or more spectacular lip sync victories. One notable example is Peppermint from season 9, who actually mimed cocking and shooting a shotgun at her opponent to the beats in Madonna's <em>Music</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Curse</a>: A few actions are jokingly referred as "cursed" by the fanbase, since they systematically result in low placement and/or elimination for the queen who did them:<ul><li> Doing the robot dance in a lipsync for your life. To date, the only survivors of the curse are Peppermint in season 9 and Heidi N Closet in season 12.</li><li> Playing Beyonc&eacute; in the Snatch Game. Tyra Sanchez (season 2) managed to be safe, but Asia O'Hara (season 10) placed low and Kenya Michaels (season 4) was eliminated.</li><li> For the makeover, doing disco-inspired or black-and-white outfits. Victims of the former are Jaidynn Diore Fierce, Kameron Michaels, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, Jackie Cox and Heidi N Closet; of the latter, Adore Delano, Alaska (in All Stars 2), Shea Coule&eacute;, Manila Luzon (in All Stars 4) and Gigi Goode. With the exception of Gigi, all of them ended up in the bottom, with Jaidynn and Manila getting eliminated.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding">Dance Party Ending</a>: The end of every episode, though in later seasons it tends to get truncated by the intro to <em>Untucked</em> when broadcast on TV.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkhorseVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkhorseVictory">Darkhorse Victory</a>: The "lipsync for the crown" format, which began in season 9 after a season with some especially infamous lipsyncs, allowed the season's darkhorses to have a better chance at winning the crown, with some truly gag-worthy results.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In season 9, Sasha Velour won two challenges, but both were team wins with Shea Coule&eacute;, who won four challenges and was often considered a frontrunner. Come the finale, Sasha, who'd never lipsynced before on the show (since she'd never been in the bottom), turned out to be an <em>incredible</em> lipsyncer who provided lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spectacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spectacle">Spectacle</a>, easily beating Shea, then taking down the season's lipsync assassin, Peppermint, to win the crown and shock the world. Sasha is the first season winner without the most challenge wins.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yvie Oddly had only <em>one</em> challenge win in the season, shared with Scarlet Envy of all people, but it's worthy of note that she placed near the top for several challenges and she only spent one time in the bottom. Still, once we hit the final four, she was the one with the least wins, but her intensity combined with her impressive flexibility made her an incredibly captivating lipsyncer, notably wowing the crowd with her mirrored headdress during her showdown with Brooke Lynn Hytes. It wins her the crown.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: Raven, Manila Luzon, Bianca Del Rio, Kennedy Davenport, Katya and Pandora Boxx are the standout examples.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Defrosting Ice Queen</a>: Raven, who was often criticized for being too cold, showed a warmer side in the Golden Gals challenge, when she bonded with her appointed "drag mother," an elderly man who lived through the gay rights movement. She even carried him off the stage at the end of their lipsync presentation when he seemed to be exhausted. She also starts forming strong bonds with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> despite claiming she's not there to make friends. A prime example is her lip sync with Jujubee in All Stars where both are clearly emotionally distraught.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">Deliberately Monochrome</a>: Detox's outfit for the season 5 reunion accomplished this effect through makeup and clothing, making her look like she stepped out of a black and white movie. It was quite impressive especially next to the other girls. Max Malanaphy's aesthetic also draws heavily on this.<ul><li> Season 8 included a Black and White Movie Realness runway challenge based on Detox' look.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">Department of Redundancy Department</a>:<ul><li> Alyssa is famous for this, such as, "Bitch sit your ass down and shut the hell up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch">bitch</a>!", "Coco was the one backstabbing me behind my back", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">and also,</a> "Girl look how orange you fucking look, girl!"<ul><li> Alyssa's drag daughter Laganja gave us "did you not or did you not come for me?"</li></ul></li><li> As said by Delta Work: "I'm terrified and scared as shit."</li><li> Ru herself became guilty of this in later seasons by introducing new features to the show that were almost identical to existing features:<ul><li> Season 8 saw the creation of the "Shade Tree", a room where the queens can go to confess negative feelings they have about the other girls... forgetting about that little reality show feature called <em>the confessional</em>, which was specifically created <em>so that people could share their honest opinions about others</em>. Unsurprisingly, the Shade Tree was only used once throughout the entire season, and was never mentioned again.</li></ul></li><li> Then Season 9 featured a lovely new wax statue of Rupaul in the workroom. A few episodes pass and Ru mentions that the statue also contains a hidden camera which may catch any shady comments the queens make if they aren't careful. Except this is the same room where <em>a full camera crew films the girls at all times anyways!</em> What do they expect the hidden camera to catch that the main cameras didn't catch anyways?</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">The Determinator</a>:<ul><li> Alaska shows shades of this, since she has auditioned for the show multiple times before finally getting in for the fifth season (which boyfriend Sharon Needles may or may not have had something to do with).</li><li> Season 11's Yvie Oddly, in spades. Not even Ehlers-Danlos syndrome stops this queen from delivering on stage, and her incredible flexibility as a result makes her a very memorable performer, even though it hurts her (and will likely leave her physically incapacitated later in life). At one point she twists her ankle, and she just turns it into a comedic runway look like it ain't no thing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisapprovingLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisapprovingLook">Disapproving Look</a>:<ul><li> They're drag queens, so plenty of them give this off, though Violet Chachki's "stink face" is worthy of note. Bianca Del Rio doled that face out like Halloween candy.</li><li> The judges of course don't have to be the least bit shy about this, especially Michelle Visage, who's a notoriously tough customer. She plays it up in the season 7 episode when Merle Ginsberg makes a surprise return.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryRollins">Henry Rollins</a> was a guest judge in season 2, to judge the queens singing a rock song.

Many a judge (including main judge Michelle Visage) has quipped that until a queen shows that weakness they can't really root for them.<ul><li> This arguably cost Season 4's Chad Michaels to lose to Sharon Needles as Michelle Visage would call Chad <em>too</em> perfect and poised to be engaging. Come All-Stars, however, they twist this around and decide that Chad's perfection <em>is</em> her weakness, which ultimately seemed to make her more endearing to the judges.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen">Drag Queen</a>: All of the competitors, naturally.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressesTheSame">Dresses the Same</a>:<ul><li> In the first episode of season 3 Phoenix and India Ferrah wore very similar outfits and hairstyles when arriving at the competition. They proceeded to glare daggers at each other.</li><li> Season 4's 'Platinum and Gold' runway had The Princess in a silver hooded catsuit ... that looks incredibly like RuPaul's silver hooded gown. RuPaul can't help but playfully cry out "She stole my look!" while The Princess struts down the runway.</li><li> Also expect this whenever there's a challenge that involves making a runway look and two queens wind up with similar ideas, complete with accusing each other of copying.</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in Season 8's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> runway. <strong>FOUR</strong> girls came out with the kimono from "Nothing Really Matters". The look on Michelle's face was priceless. Since this was one of Madge's more unusual looks, it's likely that each girl thought they were being unique by going with it, which backfired hard. And on the spinoff show <em>Fashion Photo Ruview</em>, Raja got noticeably more and more pissed off with each look.<ul><li> And the Madonna challenge returned in Season 9 and there were <em>still</em> two sets of duplicate outfits.</li></ul></li><li> Leads to an awkward moment in Season 8 when Robbie Turner walks out to the photoshoot with the previous season's winners and sees that Jinkx Monsoon is in almost the exact same wig. Since the two are both based out of Seattle and know each other it's very likely they bought it from the same place.</li><li> It looked like UK Season 1 would have a repeat of Kimonogate when the runway theme was Bond Girls and both The Vivienne and Sum Ting Wong wore a hooded ensemble inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceJones">Grace Jones</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">May Day</a>.

In the end, Divina allowed Baga to have free reign over the character, something she ended up regretting.</li><li> All-Stars 5 saw India Ferrah once again end up in this situation, this time with Miz Cracker, who wore a similarly colored blue dress with blonde accessories.

From fixing costumes and helping fit wigs, to shaping their bodies into a more womanly form, it has a multitude of uses in the art of drag. A mini-challenge in Season 3 was actually dedicated to it, in which the queens had to use various styles of duct tape and simple, black leotards to make fashionable outfits.</li><li> <span style="display:none">invoked</span><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a>:<ul><li> Delta Work's comedy routine in Season 3, at one point she starts talking about how she doesn't want to lose weight because she is afraid of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">raped on the street</a>. Cut to the audience, you can literally see their smiles disappear. It should be noted Delta was eliminated for her failed comedy routine.<ul><li> A similar thing happened to Laganja Estranga in Season 6's stand-up comedy challenge, when her jokes towards the senior citizens in the audience came off more like mean-spirited insults.

However this was more a split reaction, half the judges were offended and called out this trope, others, however, understood where Phi Phi was coming from and what she was <em>trying</em> to do, but that her delivery just made it seem insulting.</li><li> Invoked by Ru. During one season 7 challenge mocking Ru's large catalog of products, Ginger Minj lampshades Drag U's failure. Ru immediately interrupts her, offended, as he found doing the show and helping women very meaningful.

But considering Ginger's team would go on to win the challenge, it's possible Ru was just toying with her</li><li> Invoked by Trinity during a runway when she overheard Santino talking in an exaggerated lisp assuming he was making fun of the way she spoke while wearing her dental flipper, and was genuinely hurt that he would make fun of something she was obviously struggling with. This trope was averted, however, as in an <em>Untucked</em> first RuPaul has an audience aside where she explains Santino <em>wasn't</em> making fun of Trinity, he was making fun of the way she herself was speaking, which she was ok with.</li><li> While mock-interviewing Cher's mother, Georgia Holt, Joslyn brought up a sensitive subject in mentioning that as one point Georgia had considered giving her child up for abortion and asking her stance on Pro-Life/Pro-Choice now. Though slightly averted in the sense that she brought it up as a serious topic and not as a joke, on the main stage Michelle Visage scolded her outright for talking about things that just should <em>not</em> be talked about. This brought some accusations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a>, as the documentary she was being interviewed about (<em>Dear Mom, Love Cher</em>) includes discussion about that exact subject and was not brought up as out of the blue as it appeared. The issue was further complicated when it was revealed that Georgia being very vocally pro-life had been included in the information that the queens were given, giving the impression that the topic was open for discussion.</li><li> More of a meta-example but RuPaul herself has come under quite a lot of criticism for re-appropriating slurs that are used against transgender people <em>and</em> drag queens, and making those slurs into something funny and mockable. Many people believe that Ru is transphobic. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catchphrase</a> "You've Got She-Mail" and her songs <em>"Tranny-Chaser"</em> and <em>"Responsitrannity"</em> are examples of this. Things finally escalated over the line into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a> (according to many people) in Season 6 when a mini-challenge called "Female or She-Male" asked contestants to guess if an extreme close-up photo was of a biological woman or a "psychological woman" i.e. a drag queen and <em>not</em> a transsexual. Fan outcry became so bad that the episode in question has been pulled and the she-mail sound clip has been removed from future episodes completely. Even well after Season 6, the show is still quite noticeably walking on eggshells regarding the transgender issue.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E - M&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a>:<ul><li> In Season 1's recap episode, Ru shows a montage of rejected auditionees who would go on to appear in later seasons: Pandora Boxxx, Nicole Paige Brooks, Sahara Davenport, Raven, Alaska (who would also appear in the Season 3 casting special and in the audience in Season 4 before finally getting in the show for Season 5), and Detox (who, like Alaska, also reappeared in Season 3 before finally being chosen for Season 5).</li><li> In addition to Alaska and Detox, the Season 3 casting special also features Mrs Kasha Davis, Jasmine Masters, Katya, Dax Exclamationpoint, and Thorgy Thor - who will all go on to be contestants in later seasons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> in the first episode of Season 5 where the queens pass various people who will serve as guest judges while on a bus touring Hollywood, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">though it's fairly obvious that they're green screened in</a>.</li><li> Ivy Winters' unique style of dressmaking starred on the show before she did, as she had created many of Manila Luzon's praised runway outfits.

Later seasons are more open to androgyny, and runway critiques are mostly limited to the outfit itself and the queen's presentation of it.</li><li> Season Two introduced the beloved Snatch Game, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em> parody featuring celebrity impersonations by the queens. The problem is that none of the queens were sure how irreverent they were intended to be. That episode of <em>Untucked</em> features a lot of chatting about certain queens <em>disrespecting</em> their chosen celebrity, when nobody cares about that in later seasons, to say the least.</li><li> The show was always a drag competition that owed a lot to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel">America's Next Top Model</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em>, but in the first few seasons it was also something of a general reality TV parody, for example featuring challenges based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearFactor">Fear Factor</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal">Deal or No Deal</a></em>.</li><li> The first <em>All Stars</em> season is only half the usual length and features the queens competing as set pairs until the finale, where they split up into individual competitors. In each episode, the bottom two teams are up for elimination and battle it out in a tag-team lip sync. Other than having past competitors on, <em>All Stars 2</em> and <em>3</em> have more in common with each other than with the first season: both feature individual competition as in the normal seasons and use the "Lip Sync for Your Legacy" twist, where the judges set both the top two and bottom two and the tops lip sync to determine which of the bottoms to eliminate. <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> also feature a talent show as the first maxi challenge.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatThat">Eat That</a>: The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeChicken">Chicken or What</a>?" mini-challenge, where in addition to chicken, the queens also had to eat bull testicles, frog legs, and deep fried cow brains.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase">Elimination Catchphrase</a>: "Now, sashay... away."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>: Serena ChaCha was obnoxious enough to unite every other Season 5 queen against her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnragedByIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnragedByIdiocy">Enraged by Idiocy</a>: When Phi Phi O'Hara, Jiggly Caliente, and Kenya Michaels turn ugly during Season 4's Snatch Game, Latrice Royale gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">royally fed up with their bullshit</a>, calling them out on their unprofessional behavior.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Entitled Bastard</a>: One of the (many) complaints leveled against Shangela, she was quick to ask for help due to her own inexperience in drag, but when another queen asked for her help she would claim that she had to focus on her own work in the competition.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>: From the moment the queens walk through the door, they are given a prime moment to establish themselves and set themselves apart from the pack.

The button could only be used once by any pair in the entire run of the show, however.

The latter devoted a lot of focus to the clique warfare between the "Heathers" and "boogers" whereas Season 4 does away with that and draws attention to issues faced by the drag and LGBTQ communities, such as bullying and the tough lives of the queens. Main challenges such as Hope Floats (for Pride Week) and Frock the Vote (done in conjunction with the It Gets Better Project) really hammer this home.</li><li> Zig-zagged with <em>Untucked</em>. Half of <em>Untucked</em> is the queens sharing heartwarming stories and forming "a sisterhood" with each other, while the other half is the screaming matches and fights that take place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">almost every episode.</a> One fight between Sharon Needles and Phi Phi O'Hara was so heated they fought through RuPaul's message to head to the Gold Bar.

Sharon Needles has said in an interview that although she still loves the program, in her opinion it has taken the art form of drag, which used to be mature and underground, and turned it into something more "PG-13".</li><li> The final three of Season 6 (Adore Delano, Bianca Del Rio, and Courtney Act) showed the very first time in six seasons that all three finalists seemed to be nice people who genuinely enjoyed each other's company. This is a stark contrast to the previous five seasons, where the final three almost always included The Scrappy of the season, the Designated Villain, and/or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">bitter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rivalry</a> between the queens.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeopleAreSurreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeopleAreSurreal">Little People Are Surreal</a>:<ul><li> The killer in both versions of the fake horror movie from season 6 is a little person for no adequately explained reason, though it was apparently a reference to Lil' Poundcake from season 5.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Completely averted</a> in Season 8 during the make-over challenge which featured the cast of <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women:_LA">Little Women: LA<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>. Their situation is treated as nothing but sympathetic and serious, and is never used for a cheap laugh. Many of the queens spend the episode bonding with their partners and relating how being accepted due to one's size is very much like seeking acceptance for being gay, since both are something that are beyond a person's control.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>: The queens are not allowed to impersonate fictional characters in the Snatch Game, but they <em>can</em> impersonate the character's actress and base their performance on that one character. For instance, Stacy Lane Matthews played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Monique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Monique">Monique</a> but was essentially the mother from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Precious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Precious">Precious</a></em>, and BenDeLaCreme was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaggieSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaggieSmith">Maggie Smith</a>...as Countess Violet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingYourHead">Losing Your Head</a>: The horror challenge in Season 6 included the role of a disembodied head.

It was only then she realized she should have been offended by their critique.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a>:<ul><li> Despite Latrice Royale stating that it's not used as much as the queens would like to claim, it is said to happen (just like any reality show). For example, Season 5's Jinkx Monsoon/Roxxxy Andrews dynamic had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Jinkx-the-bullied-odd-duck as the hero</a>, and Roxxxy as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntagonist">close-minded-bully villain</a>. All of the queens involved &mdash; including Jinkx herself &mdash; have said that she wasn't the meek victim she was portrayed to be, and although Roxxxy did snap at Jinkx (and Alaska), she constantly apologized for it.</li><li> The commercial-break trailers do this all the damn time. Statements are taken out of context or paired with different reaction shots to, for instance, make a sarcastic or joking comment seem like a genuine, deliberate insult. One <em>Untucked</em> segment in season 4 even seemed tailor-made for this treatment, with clips showing Dida Ritz flying off the handle...when in reality, the queens were asked to imitate other queens, and Dida was imitating Phi Phi's infamous "Party City" tantrum.</li><li> RuPaul and Michelle <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rupaulpodcast.com/episodes/2014/12/17/episode-19-dont-blame-it-on-the-edit">have claimed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the editing is to help the queens look better.</li><li> Willam actually called out a rather erroneous use of this trope used at the Season 4 reunion/finale. During the "What did Willam do??!" segment he revealed the reason he got kicked off was because of a contract-breaking conjugal visit from his husband, which was followed by the camera cutting to a man in the audience, presumably Willam's partner. However, the whole excuse was a lie and Willam's husband actually refused to be any part of it, so the camera cut was actually to just some random old guy who Willam didn't even know.</li><li> Shangela's famous "sugar daddy" rant in <em>Untucked</em> season 3 is bleeped to sound a bit worse than it actually was. In the censored version she closes the rant with "you [bleep] bitch", but in the uncensored version there's no "fucking" or any other extra word&mdash;it's simply "you bitch".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a>:<ul><li> Raja. Even before appearing on the show she had a drag mother relationship with a couple of the other competitors, putting Delta in shows and helping Shangela to dress for the Season 2 reunion.</li><li> In season 4, Chad Michaels, who spends most of one <em>Untucked</em> episode alternately comforting Sharon Needles and reminding her teammates from the challenge that Jiggly Caliente's feelings should taken into consideration. Chad even stands up to a big, burly DILF and in the <em>Untucked</em> episode cautions, "you don't come for [attack] my people, not while I'm around."</li><li> We also have Latrice Royale, who takes on something of a drag mother role to Lashauwn Beyond, whom she knew from back home, and called Jiggly out in the interests of helping her grow as a person.</li><li> Bianca became this in season 6, especially to Adore and Trinity.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy">Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy</a>: In Season 1, the queens had to give glamorous makeovers to a group of tomboyish female martial artists who had never worn makeup or high heels in their lives.

Jade Jolie got her name by combining the name of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a> character and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>. Jinkx Monsoon's name comes from the fact that if "there's a one in a million chance of something bad happening it's going to happen to her" and Edie Monsoon from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>. Alyssa Edwards got her first name from Alyssa Milano.</li><li> Detox's full name is Detox Icunt.

Phi Phi addressed this on social media and it turned out the two black queens both <em>laughed</em> at her joke, and their "dour" faces were just neutral expressions from other parts of the segment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>: A major one in season 10. When the judges point out to Miss Blair St. Claire that her dainty and cutesy outfits are becoming somewhat one-note, she reveals she's obsessed with surrounding herself with pretty things because she feels dirty after being raped at a college party.<ul><li> Another one in Season 12, where we go from Jackie giving an emotional speech to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a> in response to his question about what it means to be both queer and Middle Eastern and the importance of her runway look, to the same guest judge asking Gigi about their tuck and how it is maintained.

Bianca Del Rio has said that Sharon Needles and Willam were very bitchy to her when she opened for a Drag Race show, claiming Bianca didn't deserve to be there since (at the time) she had never been on the show. Adore Delano has also said that Penny Tration acted very stuck up towards her (despite the fact they were both the most popular of the Facebook-voted queens for Season 5, Penny only just barely winning over Adore).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGameplayElimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGameplayElimination">Non-Gameplay Elimination</a>:<ul><li> Happened most infamously with Willam during Season 4, who was ejected from the game for rule-breaking. No reason was given for her elimination at the time other than "She broke the rules," leading to the "What happened to Willam?" controversy that wasn't answered until the Season 4 finale. However, several queens later said that the reason given for Willam's disqualification on the show (conjugal visits with her husband) was not the actual reason she was kicked off. Several years later it turned out Willam invented that story because she <em>wanted</em> to leave the show, not getting along with the producers and feeling the show had done all it could for her career.</li><li> Adore ended up voluntarily leaving the show during the second episode of All Stars 2 after receiving extremely harsh critiques during the first episode and realizing she wasn't in the right place mentally to be on the show.</li><li> During Season 9, Eureka was asked to leave the competition for medical reasons due to a knee injury she had sustained a few episodes prior. This ended up being a happier example than the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGameplayElimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGameplayElimination">Non-Gameplay Elimination</a>, though, as Eureka was given an open invitation from Ru to return and compete in Season 10 if she wished to (which she took up and made it to the Top 4).</li><li> All Stars 3 had BenDeLaCreme choosing to eliminate herself halfway through by blacking out a name on the elimination lipstick tube and writing her own name in. She felt that the other girls in the competition had more to gain from winning than she did.</li><li> Just as Season 12 started airing, several men came out and revealed that Sherry Pie had catfished them, posing as a New York casting director to get them to perform sexual acts on camera. Once this came to light, World of Wonder officially pronounced Sherry disqualified from the competition: she wasn't invited to the finale filmed later that spring, her challenge winnings were donated to the Trevor Project, and she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">edited out of the show as much as possible</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenBotheringWithTheAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenBotheringWithTheAccent">Not Even Bothering with the Accent</a>: When Aiden Zhane impersonates the British Patricia Quinn for Snatch Game, she forgets to use a British accent and ends up sticking with her American accent for the entire thing. Michelle immediately clocks her on this during the judging.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not So Above It All</a>: Ru is a friendly and playful host, but also exudes a constant air of professionalism &mdash; until season 10, where she starts giggling uncontrollably every time she's reminded of Vanessa Vanjie Mateo's famous exit. Michelle Visage takes particular delight in breaking her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">N-Word Privileges</a>:<ul><li> The term "she-male" is often considered offensive, but punnishly reclaimed to introduce the first segment: "Girl, you got She Mail!"</li><li> In Season 3, the other queens question Manila Luzon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">N-Word Privileges</a> in regards to some of her Asian stereotype schtick.</li><li> Later that episode, Stacy dresses as Mo'Nique's character from <em>Precious</em>. While Stacy is black, she is very light-skinned (and only brings up her Native American heritage in a later episode), so she decided to dress in borderline blackface. This went unmentioned by the other queens.</li><li> In season 4, we end up with a discussion of the line between racially charged, off-color humor and offensiveness when, acting as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a>-esque character in the "Frock the Vote" challenge, Phi Phi O'Hara refers to Latrice Royale and DiDa Ritz as "the help".</li><li> Another example of something going unquestioned: in the runway presentation for season three's "America" challenge, Raja comes to the stage in an outfit inspired by Cher and Janis Joplin, which features a Native American war bonnet. While Raja is a PoC, she's Indonesian, not Native American, and while some commenters in the fandom have commented on this and whether or not it went over the good taste line with regards to cultural appropriation, the judges and other competitors did not. She actually received high praise for the outfit. Raja generally enjoys imitating other cultures in her drag.</li><li> Sharon Needles (white) skirts the same line in a season four mini-challenge, when she designs a pair of shoes (inspired by an Absolut Berri Sour cocktail), and claims that she wanted to represent "the plight of American Indians." It doesn't win the mini-challenge, but also attracts no comments. In real life outside the competition her tendency towards this has caused some backlash.</li><li> A term that is thrown around quite a bit is the term "tranny" &#151; a slur aimed at both trans* people and drag queens that is used quite often and casually on the show.</li><li> Happened again in season 6 with the use of the term "shemale" in the "female or shemale" mini challenge, where the racers had to guess if the extreme close up on screen was a cis woman or a famous drag queen. "Shemale" has also been used on the show playfully in the "You've got She-Mail" intro to mini challenges, and in the wake of this the show and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LOGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LOGO">LOGO</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/04/14/rupauls-drag-race-logo-tv-apologize-transphobic-slur">have announced that they will avoid using that term in the future<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, removed the episode featuring that challenge and replace the "You've Got She-Mail" challenge intro soundbite.</li><li> Avoiding this dilemma is most likely why, when Season 8 did a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>-themed makeover challenge involving the cast of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleWomenOfLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleWomenOfLA">Little Women Of LA</a></em>, at no point are they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">ever referred to as "munchkins"</a>. Likewise, one of the women discusses the <em>other</em> m-word, "midget". One would have hoped that most people would know by now that that's an outdated slur against little people, but she still hears it from time to time and points out that it technically doesn't specify "small person", but "small <em>thing</em>".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>: Starting with Season 7, every season has had a challenge involving a large group lip sync performance. This was done to help out queens like Coco and Trinity K. Benet, whose main strength was their lip syncing abilities and struggled to win challenges on the show since the only time queens lip sync is when they're up for elimination.<ul><li> The final challenge of Season 11 (writing, recording and performing a verse to RuPaul's song) had Vanjie and Brooke in the bottom two (when in previous seasons no one was eliminated, or the weakest queen was simply eliminated without a lipsync) but no winner was declared, even when many people thought Yvie was the best performer of the week. In Season 12 the final challenge gets upgraded to a "regular" challenge, with a clear winner and a bottom two lipsyncing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>: Drag queens rarely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchAlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchAlike">date each other</a>, but there have been a few such couples within the show: Sharon Needles &amp; Alaska, and Manila Luzon &amp; Sahara Davenport before her death. Pandora Boxx and Darienne Lake dated long before the show. Season 11 featured the first onscreen romance between Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Brooke Lynn Hytes; however, they broke up at some point between the shooting of the last episode and the reunion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>:<ul><li> The guaranteed reaction whenever Ru appears in the workroom halfway through a challenge and announces "a little twist."</li><li> Willam when Ru reveals that the mini challenge that week would be a lie detector test, since she was supposedly getting visits from her husband behind the producers' backs. The test wasn't about that (it was about pairing the queens off based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositesAttract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositesAttract">who was the least compatible</a>).</li><li> An epic one from Alaska after seeing how terribly her chosen Marine walks in heels.<ul><li> And a moderate one from Jaida while watching her superfan partner try to do the same.</li></ul></li><li> The heavier queens in Season 3 when Ru announced that the mini challenge one week was nude photos.</li><li> Bianca decides to play Judge Judy for the Snatch Game challenge, then has this reaction upon learning that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy">Judge Judy</a></em> is RuPaul's favorite TV show.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid">Old Maid</a>: Pretty much the opinion of any queen over the age of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Gasp!</a></em> 35 is that they are a relic of the drag community, and may even be treated with joking to casual disdain from the younger queens in the competition.<ul><li> Raja and Bianca Del Rio are perfect examples of this, both of them were only 37 during their respective seasons, but were often the butt of jokes that would make a viewer guess they were well over 50 instead. Interestingly, Bianca wasn't even the <em>second</em> oldest in her season (Vivacious and Darienne were both older than her) but she had the most authentic "grumpy old lady" attitude.<div class="indent"><strong>Manila Luzon:</strong> <em>[regarding Raja]</em> I'm first runner-up, so if Raja dies of old age then maybe I'll get the crown.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Adore Delano:</strong> <em>[regarding Bianca Del Rio]</em> She's everything I want to be when I'm 57. <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>]</em> Oh my god she's going to kill me!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bianca Del Rio:</strong> <em>[to Darienne Lake]</em> For the record, I get called the old one.

(Ben is 31 while Gia is 23, so the age difference isn't that much, but Gia was very shallow and judged her competitors on their appearance alone.)<div class="indent"><strong>Gia Gunn:</strong> I feel like you must be the motherly figure. <br><strong>BenDeLaCreme:</strong> <em>[offended]</em> Motherly... you called me old, alright.</div></li><li> Kandy Ho flat out asked Tempest DuJour her age and then made disdainful comments about her style. Tempest is naturally offended.<div class="indent"><strong>Kandy Ho:</strong> So... how old <em>are</em> you? <br><strong>Tempest DuJour:</strong> How old am I?

Themes so far have been: wet and sexy poses with the Pit Crew, on the hood of a car; a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em>-inspired shoot (featuring a large fan, a dramatic piece of fabric, a cannon between the competitors' legs, and the Pit Crew); a Christmas card photo (taken on a wintry backdrop, while the competitors bounce on a trampoline, are bombarded with fake snow, and/or play with a gag candy cane); "Apocalyptic couture" (taken while getting spun around and covered in neon-colored paint); "Hollywood Splash" (posing gracefully while submerged in a glass tank full of water); Season 6 had half the queens experience a drop shot (photographing the queens as they dive from a ledge into a padded pit), while the other half have a sexy pillow fight action-shot with the Pit Crew; a group photo with previous winners for Season 8; Season 11 had every queen paired with a different Drag Race alumna; in the first UK Season the queens posed with their "severed" head; and in the first Canadian season the queens scaled a replica mountain and posed with a flag before getting hit with the industrial fan.<ul><li> Oddly enough, Seasons 7, 9 and 12 did not do this. They instead had two runways (Seasons 7 and 12 had three, actually, with a spring fashion and fall fashion runway for the mini-challenge along with the main runway; 9 had two main runways, hometown and Lady Gaga).</li><li> Neither did Season 10, which had the queens dance and strike poses on a large, X-shaped stage (X being the Roman numeral for 10) surrounded by past contestants.</li></ul></li><li> The first episode also involves making a new, original drag outfit out of whatever random things RuPaul can throw at her queens. The materials they had to work with were: assorted thrift store clothes and accessories (Seasons 1 and 10); curtains (Season 2); Christmas-themed (Season 3); apocalyptic themed (Season 4); random garbage (Season 5); and a nude illusion (Season 7). Season 6 had each queen work with materials themed to a specific TV series (for the first half of the premiere) or party style (for the second half); in Season 8 each of them had to replicate a design challenge from a previous season; in Season 11 each one was assigned materials inspired by a past contestant; and Canada season 1 had each contestant assigned materials with Canadian themes (with punny drag names).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note57y0z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note57y0z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note57y0z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Examples: Yukon Gold Digger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Man of Green Gables</a>, Calgary Glampede, Quebefroid, Muskokurrrr</span><ul><li> Again, Seasons 9, 12 and UK 1 did not do this at all, with two pageant-like runways for 9 and UK 1 and two group performances for the two Season 12 premieres.</li></ul></li><li> There will always be some kind of acting-related challenge. So far, the list has included: scripted challenges often parodying other films or TV series; shooting commercials for different products; fake trailers for films or TV series; newscasts and talk show improv; a ballet about RuPaul's life; parodies of Shakespeare, John Waters or Ru herself; presidential debates; and lipsyncing to previous seasons' <em>Untucked</em> dramas.</li><li> There will always be some group challenge, or several, especially towards the beginning of the season when the number of competitors is still high.</li><li> From season two forward: THE SNATCH GAME (the queens impersonate celebrities on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a>-style game show); and the "throwing shade" mini-challenge (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">The library is OPEN!</a>).</li><li> From season two forward: some kind of music and/or live performance-related challenge. Season two had the queens dress as rockstars to sing RuPaul's song "Ladyboy" to a live audience; season three had the queens perform stand-up comedy routines in one episode, then record different versions of RuPaul's song "Superstar" and lipsynch their versions; season four's "frenemies" challenge involved the queens singing, "Better Than You," and putting together a live nightclub act; season five had the queens write and sing a charity single then roast RuPaul; season six had a live-sung musical and a stand up comedy routine; season seven had the queens present and receive at a fake awards show; season eight had them write and perform live a new wave song; season nine had another roast (this time dedicated to Michelle Visage); season ten had them host a Drag Con panel and another musical; season eleven had a magic show; season twelve had a group number in the two premieres, a musical and a stand-up show.<ul><li> Starting from All Stars 2, in the first episode the queens showcase their abilities in a talent show. All Stars 2 also had a stand up challenge in pairs, and All Stars 4 had the roast of Lady Bunny (under the pretense of it being her funerary eulogy).</li></ul></li><li> An episode where someone who isn't a drag queen gets made over to be the queens' drag sister/mother/daughter/other relation.<ul><li> Season one: cis female fighters</li><li> Season two: older gay men who didn't do drag</li><li> Season three: "Jocks In Frocks": heterosexual male jocks</li><li> Season four: "DILFs (Dads I'd Like To Frock)": macho heterosexual fathers</li><li> Season five: "Super Troopers": gay military vets</li><li> Season six: bridegrooms into drag brides (and the queens themselves as the mothers of the brides) while the real brides were given tuxedos; Ru herself presided over the subsequent mass wedding.</li><li> Season seven: eliminated queens from earlier in the season, for a "conjoined twins" look</li><li> Season eight: the cast of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleWomenOfLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleWomenOfLA">Little Women Of LA</a></em>, with looks inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em></li><li> Season nine: members of the show's crew</li><li> Season ten: social media stars</li><li> Season eleven: eliminated queens (though, unlike season seven, the eliminated queen in the winning pair did not return in the competition)</li><li> Season twelve: female superfans of the show</li><li> All Stars 2 and UK 1: queens' relatives</li><li> All Stars 4: "Best Judies": queens' best friends/significant others</li><li> Canada 1: gay refugees granted asylum in Canada through the efforts of the Rainbow Railroad charity</li></ul></li><li> The "Halfway Curse". Halfway through each season, Ru will announce that winning a challenge will no longer grant immunity from elimination the following week. Once this announcement is made, there <em>will</em> come a time where a queen who won the previous challenge will be sent home the next week.<ul><li> This changed from Season 6 onwards, though, when Ru announced in the premiere that there would be <em>no immunity at all</em> granted to challenge winners. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> below.</li></ul></li><li> This trope is subverted slightly in the case of the Balls. They're irregular but they often happen nearing the final four or five of the competition, where the queens are assigned to do three themed runways (two in Season 7). Since Season 10, these balls have been occurring earlier in the season.</li><li> Everybody Loves Puppets: From Season 4 to 9, the top 4/5 queens had to imitate a fellow competitor using a hand puppet for a mini challenge, including putting it in drag. It was absent in seasons 10 and 11, but brought back in 12 and featured in both UK 1 and Canada 1.</li><li> The finale of every season features the top three competitors performing in some new RuPaul music video, one gets eliminated based on that challenge, and then the top two lipsynch against each other for the crown. Usually, at the beginning of these episodes it's Michelle Visage, not Ru, who enters the workroom and introduces the challenge.<ul><li> This was changed from Season 4 onward due to previous winners being leaked. Instead, Ru will make all three finalists lipsynch for their lives, then lets viewers weigh in before making her decision in an episode filmed shortly before its airdate. Since the rest of the season is filmed in late summer/early fall, this means the queens have to wait <em>months</em> before knowing who won.</li><li> Changed again starting from All Stars 2/Season 9. Each queen in the top 4/5 writes and records a verse for a new RuPaul song, then performs it live with full choreography. In regular seasons, the top 4 then proceeds to the finale where they have to lip-sync for the crown in a tournament bracket fashion.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a>: During Season 5, Alyssa Edwards's and Coco Montrese's falling out over the Miss Gay America Pageant had to be given the spotlight <em>at least</em> once per episode, usually more during any challenge where the two were forced to work together. The only exception in this is the episode for the final challenge, and that's only because it had been a whole episode since the last of the pair had been eliminated.<ul><li> Consider "Miss Vanjie" to be said at least once every episode in Season 10.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneJudgeToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneJudgeToRuleThemAll">One Judge to Rule Them All</a>: Although RuPaul takes into consideration all of the critiques of her judges, and of the Drag Race fans during the final elimination, she has said several times over that every decision on the show is hers and hers alone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Semi-averted when Season 7 gives us two queens partly named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a>'s alter-ego Sasha Fierce: Sasha Belle and Jaidynn Dior Fierce.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Only Known by Their Nickname</a>: The queens are only ever referred to regularly by their drag personas, in and out of drag.

Coco and Alyssa have <em>long</em> put their feud behind them and got along just fine before Coco's elimination (for that matter, this was implied as far back as the Season 5 finale), and "Rolaskatox" is now just "Rotox" because Alaska has drifted away from Roxxxy and Detox and would rather just do her own thing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTVShowMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTVShowMansion">Reality TV Show Mansion</a>: Averted.

She ends up doing Celia Cruz but falls flat, leading to her elimination.</li><li> When Jiggly Caliente was complaining that she didn't know how to sew at all, Lashauwn Beyond's response was, "This is not the first season," and that she can't use that as an excuse because she should have been aware sewing challenges are a staple of the show.<ul><li> In the Season 6 opener, Adore Delano can't sew either, and Ru herself expresses bewilderment at how sewing is a lost art among younger drag queens.</li></ul></li><li> Whenever a queen in the later seasons complains about the acting/comedic challenges.

All the other queens expect her to try to sabotage Bianca Del Rio (a professional comedian) by putting her on first. Instead, she puts Bianca on <em>last</em> and puts <em>herself</em> in the worst spot of all, right before Bianca. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bianca, predictably, kills the challenge and wins the week while Joslyn is directly called out by the judges for this blunder and forced to lip sync.</span></li><li> During interviews and her commentary on the season 7 premiere with Alaska, Bianca points out that if a queen can't sing, dance, act, do comedy, or sew in some capacity, they really had no business being there in the first place.</li><li> This is the reason Naysha Lopez was the first queen eliminated on Season 8: she didn't know how to sew and the main challenge was to create one. But because she's a high-budget pageant queen, she relied mainly on <em>buying</em> her dresses and her inability to make a presentable outfit resulted in her landing in the bottom two and getting eliminated due to Laila turning in a slightly better lip sync performance.</li><li> Charlie Hides, whose act involves live singing, does not lip sync and professes to be proud of not lip synching &mdash; and nevertheless entered a competition that regularly features lip synching. Apparently the plan was to always be good enough to stay out of the Lip Sync For Your Life bracket; that didn't work out, and Charlie was sent home, after intentionally not trying during her lip sync.</li><li> If a queen doesn't even know how to lip sync or the words to the song, they're definitely going home. Like Charlie Hides before her, part of the reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Valentina</span> gets sent home was she didn't know the words to the song she was lip synching to and wore a mask to cover up this glaring error.

The judges weren't impressed, although that was because it looked like a man's tuxedo instead of being cinched in to create a feminine silhouette.</li><li> In the Season 5 "Draggle Rock" challenge (teams have to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedKidsShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedKidsShow">Subverted Kids Show</a>), Alaska dresses as the male farmer "Buffalo Bill".

While it visibly puzzled the judges it didn't land her in the bottom either.</li><li> The one situation in which portraying a man is accepted is during the Snatch Game, especially when the chosen male celebrity is flamboyant and/or over the top.

This led to Ru <em>stopping the lip sync</em> for the first time in the history of the show, telling Valentina to take off the mask, and restarting the lip sync. At this point it became apparent why she chose to keep the mask on: she didn't know the words to the song.

She was already in an uphill battle since the Destiny's Child-inspired challenge was not her style, and she wasn't getting along with group leader Akashia, who ignored her ideas and made her sew the outfits since Akashia didn't know what else to do with her.

Any fan with a keen eye can easily pick out outfits the queens are wearing, and it can spoil some of the bottom two lipsynchs since if the queen on the bottom was in one of the those clips wearing an outfit she hasn't worn yet, she's obviously going to be sticking around until she wears it.<ul><li> For example, in Season 6 the <em>Untucked</em> intro shows Adore Delano wearing her "White Diamonds Tutu", an outfit she would not end up wearing until the <em>penultimate</em> episode!</li><li> In the Season 13 premiere it appears that half of the cast will be eliminated after just one lip-sync, and in their entrance looks to boot.

Despite initial fears of a simple rehash, the show has garnered a strong following both at home and abroad &mdash; mostly due to the difference in British versus American drag. British drag has its roots in more raw, less glamorous venues (pubs, working-men's clubs, etc), and lacks the look-based pageant/ballroom culture of the US drag scene, which lends the UK iteration a tone that is a little grittier, more humour-based, and full of outrageously shocking language. And since there's no big cash prize, the queens are more able to have fun and not outgun each other like their American counterparts. Ru has clearly leaned into the British setting in a big way, and along with a newly badged, Queen's Guards themed "Brit-Crew", he has tasked the queens with a multitude of British-themed challenges and main-stage looks: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFairLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFairLady">Day at the Races</a>," "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Draggy</a>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">Bond Girl Glamorama</a>," and of course, <strong>THE</strong> Queen herself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II.</a> When Ru quizzes The Vivienne on the subject, she perfectly sums up all of the above: <em>"I want to go to the pub on a Sunday, get a pint, and have someone like Baga make me laugh."</em><ul><li> Further clarified by UK judge Graham Norton: <em>"I think what makes the British Drag scene special is how funny it is. It doesn&#146;t just have a sense of humour, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">it has a sense of humour about itself</a>. I think that&#146;s a real difference that you get watching the other versions. No matter how dramatic or tense it is the British Queens are still having a laugh."</em></li></ul></li><li> <em>Canada's Drag Race</em>, the Canadian version of the show began in 2020. Like the UK version above, the show maintains the same overall premise, but with its own twists. The Canadian iteration is further removed from the original than the UK version, as for one, Ru is absent from the judging panel and only appears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a> via video message to deliver the weekly challenges. The judges are made up of <em>Drag Race US</em> (but Canadian) alumna Brooke Lynn Hytes as the lead judge, alongside fashion model Stacey McKenzie, actor Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman and a weekly guest judge. In tone, the series is fairly similar to the US version, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">levels of hysteria are toned down somewhat</a>, and due to Canada being a francophonic nation there is also a liberal smattering of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLooksSexierIfFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLooksSexierIfFrench">French chic</a> via the Qu&eacute;becoise queens.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Transgender</a>: While most of the queens identify as men out of drag, some contestants are women: Sonique, Monica Beverly Hills, Carmen Carrera, Stacy Lane Matthews, Kenya Michaels, Gia Gunn, Peppermint, and Jiggly Caliente. Additionally, a significant number of queens are non-binary &mdash; Jinkx Monsoon, Raja Gemini, Violet Chachki, Kelly Mantle and Courtney Act have spoken about not being cisgender. <em>Canada's Drag Race</em> gives us Ilona Verley, an Indigenous queen who identifies as two-spirit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: Several queens know each other from before the show and have this type of bond with each other.<ul><li> Shannel and Chad Michaels, for instance, have known each other for over 15 years.</li><li> Raven and Jujubee also describe themselves this way, which makes it excruciating for them both when they're forced to lip sync against each other in the penultimate All Stars episode.</li><li> Alyssa Edwards, Laganja Estranga and Shangela are a drag family, The Haus of Edwards. Vivienne Pinay and Gia Gunn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">eventually join them</a> after bonding with them during the show.</li><li> Ru also invokes this idea after Roxxxy Andrews breaks down on the stage after recounting how her mother abandoned her, saying that as gay people they get to create their own families.</li><li> Pretty much every season, usually in an <em>Untucked</em> episode or the behind the scenes special in the first season, there'll be at least one point where the remaining queens say they're like sisters and have formed a bond, even if they're still competing and may fight with each other at times. A lot of the queens who have met through the show have gone on to regularly work together and perform in shows with each other after their stint on <em>Drag Race.</em></li><li> The Final 3 of Season 6&mdash;Bianca, Adore, and Courtney&mdash;all form a close friendship that lacks the rivalry/drama of all the other Top 3's. They remain close friends who enjoy working together when they get the chance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> when Ru says that Coco's rendition of a ventriloquist puppet should be "More Pinocchio, less the doll from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a></em>."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValleyMakeup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValleyMakeup">Uncanny Valley Makeup</a>:<ul><li> One challenge in season 5 involves the queens having to put on their makeup in the dark.

However, there are a few exceptions:<ul><li> One of the grand prizes offered to the winner used to be a headlining spot on the Drag Race tour. While this seems like a good prize in theory, being on the tour takes up a good chunk of the winner's time in the year where they are most popular (the year following their season, when they're still fresh in the audience's mind), while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunnerUpTakesItALl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunnerUpTakesItALl">runners-up are free to go on and take more high-profile gigs</a>.</li><li> There are also cases where the prize offered to the challenge winners end up being useless based on their circumstances:<ul><li> During Season 7, Pearl won a weekend trip to New York City for one of her challenge wins... except she lives in NYC to begin with.</li><li> Sasha Velour won a year's supply of haircare products...despite being bald.</li></ul></li><li> There's also the fact that winning the mini-challenge of an episode often means being named team captain or some other position of authority for the main challenge. If her team does poorly, she'll be the first one thrown under the bus and is more likely than her team-members to end up having to lipsynch.</li><li> <em>Drag Race UK</em> removes the extravagant challenge prizes, with the winning queen instead recieving a "Ru Peter Badge", a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter">Blue Peter Badges</a>. This is even lampshaded after Baga Chipz wins one, after which she proudly declares that she will sell it on the internet in 5 years. The reason for this is because this version of the show airs on the tax-payer funded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">BBC</a>, which prohibits expensive prizes on its game shows.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a>: Every season there's at least one contestant &mdash; usually from Puerto Rico &mdash; with a flawed grasp of English and an extremely thick accent, meaning the other queens have no idea what she's saying half the time, and due to the language/culture barrier, certain jokes and references might fly over her head. Yara Sofia was well aware of this and actually used it as a joke in several challenges. And as her friend Alexis points out, Yara is frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a> <em>even in Spanish</em>.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EloquentInMyNativeTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EloquentInMyNativeTongue">Eloquent in My Native Tongue</a>: Upon elimination, the unintelligible queen of the season will give an eloquent and perfectly clear farewell speech in Spanish in her last interview. The two exceptions are Season 1's Nina Flowers, since she made it to the Final 2 and Season 6's April Carrion, who can smoothly switch between Spanish and English.</li><li> In season 6, Trinity K. Bonet is criticized for her enunciation, due to the false teeth she wears in drag.</li></ul></li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

When Robbie Turner comes out in a Cowardly Lion-inspired outfit in Season 8, Ru says "okay nobody mention Cecil" to the other judges. A reference to the controversial killing of Cecil the Lion in July of 2015, which was still a hot topic when the show was filming late summer 2015, but was old news by the time the episode aired the following Spring.<ul><li> Another example came in Season 12, when in the episode "World's Worst", to prove they are gay, the fruits are asked by Ross which team won the Super Bowl that year (being 2019 when it was filmed) to which they answer "The Patriots!" yet by the time it aired in March 2020, the Kansas City Chiefs had already won the Super Bowl.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe">Unlimited Wardrobe</a>:<ul><li> Nearly everyone, but Ru especially.</li><li> In season 11, Vanessa Vanjie Mateo subverted this by having a seemingly limitless supply of <em>swimsuits.</em> Michelle got sick of that runway look really quickly, but Vanjie just <em>kept wearing swimsuits</em> until Michelle could barely even stand to give the same critique anymore. Vanjie eventually got the hint.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a>:<ul><li> "Fish" or "Fishy" for convincingly faking a woman. Unusual to the mainstream, anyway. It's been gay slang (especially among Blacks and Latinos) for decades. An unsuccessful fish, by the way, is a "trout".</li><li> Also the term "Ruphemism", which is basically an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a> popularized by RuPaul herself.</li><li> The Ruphemism "Peanut Butter" refers to a gorgeous set of legs, as in "smooth and easy to spread". Jinkx Monsoon makes up her own euphemism during a read, "Crunchy (peanut butter)", in regards to a queen who has obvious face stubble under her makeup.</li><li> "Reading" a queen means you're poking fun at or insulting a queen based on their looks or talents, whereas "Reading for/to filth" is a more severe and less humorous version (at least for the recipient) of this term.</li><li> "Kai-kai", for when two queens have sex, technically referring specifically to sex in drag. Not to be confused with "kiki", which means to socialize and make small talk with a queen.</li><li> Asian drag queens on the show are often called "ladyboys" after Thailand's notorious transgender prostitute culture (even if they're not Thai), and also the RuPaul song.</li><li> "Serving realness". In usage, queens will use this to summarize their look; for example she might be "serving country realness". Since it's just a look put on by a drag queen, it isn't <em>actually</em> "real", but it's as real as possible.</li><li> Raja, when hosting Fashion Photo Ruview, refers to feet as biscuits and shoes as biscuit-baskets, especially if she dislikes them; the term is likeliest to come up when a queen wears open-toed shoes with tights.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>: More of a meta example, RuPaul has said time and time again that she would rather see her queens go too far and have to be pulled back, than to not go far enough and play it safe. She even mentions this trope by name during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a> challenge, where she wanted to see her queens "turn it up to eleven!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a>: The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GSqonKf5p0">teaser<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for Season 6 has the queens do several actions which refer to drag and gay lingo.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9s6r7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9s6r7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9s6r7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"serving fish", "realness", "spilling the tea", "working it", "turning looks", "throwing shade", "reading"</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>: Several queens who know each other before the show have this dynamic. Raja and Manila from season 3 are one of the more obvious examples, with Manila making potshots at Raja's age and Raja firing right back. After Raja is crowned the season's winner Manila got in one last zing by saying that at least if Raja died of old age she could take over the crown as the runner up. Bianca also has this dynamic with <em>everyone</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">Vocal Dissonance</a>:<ul><li> Jade Jolie and Willam both have extremely soft and feminine voices that work really well while in drag, but become this while in boy mode. When Jade portrays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> in the Snatch Game challenge, the judges say that it's a perfect match.</li><li> Inversely, several queens have deep male voices that they make no attempt to disguise when in drag. Rebecca Glasscock, Tyra Sanchez, Bianca Del Rio and Raja come to mind. Ironically, all of them were often praised for their feminine presentation (Tyra, Bianca and Raja won their respective seasons and Rebecca made the Final Three in hers), though the judges often lampshaded Tyra's contrabass voice.</li><li> Intentionally invoked by Detox in the perfume commercial challenge, where she starts out using her usual feminine voice and switches to a deep masculine voice when saying the name of the perfume, <strong>Heroine</strong>.</li><li> Jinkx's singing voice is pure fish.</li><li> Guest judge Esther Dean would be a rare non-drag example. As a songwriter she mostly works behind the scenes, so if you're primarily familiar with her as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbian</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchPerfect">Pitch Perfect</a></em>, it can be a little jarring to hear her natural speaking voice, which is very high-pitched and girlish.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a>:<ul><li> During the runway presentation, Ru likes to ask the queens who they think should be sent home, knowing full well it will lead to backstage drama for <em>Untucked</em>.</li><li> Ru also also likes to try doing this during the Reunions, like in Season 5 when she asks Jade Jolie about the "backrolls" incident involving Alyssa Edwards, hoping to stir up drama. When Jade doesn't take the bait and just states sweetly that she thinks Alyssa is fabulous, Ru abruptly ends the interview and moves things along.</li><li> Was quite obvious during the Season 7 Snatch Game, when both Miss Fame and Violet Chachki wanted to do Donatella Versace, with Miss Fame stepping back and letting Violet have it. Ru came into the workroom and pretty much strong-armed Fame into going back to doing Versace, then turns right around and convinces Violet to <em>not</em> do Versace for the exact same reasons Ru told Fame to not change her pick. Violet even says outright in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam">Confession Cam</a> that Ru was just trying to stir the pot between them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunction</a>: It's gonna happen from time to time.<ul><li> Heidi N Closet's first runway walk in season 12 sees her lose her gigantic hat, and have to keep on walking as if nothing happened. She later loses her <em>wig</em> during a lipsync, and again she just puts it right back on and keeps performing.</li><li> Played with elsewhere in season 12. During a lip-sync, Rock M Sakura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit">Impractically Fancy Outfit</a>, complete with rigid panniers, gives her little room to move so she attempts to tear it apart, but the actual malfunction is that the dress is <em>too well built</em> and she keeps trying to fully tear the skirt off only for it to continually hang on by a thread. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It leads to her going home earlier than anyone expected.</span></li><li> In the first episode of <em>Canada's Drag Race</em> alone, we see Rita Baga pop her tuck and Juice Boxx getting her jewelry caught in her tights, <em>during her entrance.</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe">We Hardly Knew Ye</a>:<ul><li> The first queen eliminated each season, especially since the first challenge usually involves designing an outfit out of unconventional materials. Anyone who watches <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em> knows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceASeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceASeason">random scraps challenge</a> is difficult even for experienced designers, let alone performers who might not make their own costumes or even know how to sew. As a result, many talented queens have been eliminated due to being unable to overcome this one hurdle, leaving many fans wondering <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>. Averted by Shangela, who famously returned in Season 3 and All Stars 3; Naysha Lopez, who was brought back within Season 8; and Season 10 where Vanjie's elimination statement quickly became an internet meme.</li><li> The second queen eliminated arguably has it worse. Whereas the first is remembered simply by being the first and will have everyone debating whether or not they went home too soon, and the third lasts just long enough to gain a following (or notoriety), the second queen is almost always met with indifference. So far only Tammie Brown and Vivacious (by way of her headpiece Ornacia) have managed to buck this trend.</li><li> Season 9 attempts to prevent this by making the first episode non-elimination, meaning that even the first out got at least two episodes to shine. Season 12 takes this a step further and makes the first <em>two</em> episodes non-elimination, and splits the cast up between the two so that each of the queens gets more exposure amongst a smaller cast for their first episode.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">We Used to Be Friends</a>: Coco and Alyssa, who refer to the fallout from the Miss Gay America pageant as ending their friendship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: Snatch Game is this on a meta level, as it has a tendency to flip the script and change the trajectory of the season. Quite often, a middle-of-the-road or even struggling queen will emerge as a serious competitor (Pandora Boxx, Jinkx Monsoon, BenDeLaCreme, Kennedy Davenport) and a queen who was doing well until then &mdash; sometimes even a frontrunner &mdash; will end up going home (Kenya Michaels, Lineysha Sparx, Max, Acid Betty).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> It's Season 4. Sharon Needles and Phi Phi O'Hara have just had an epic lip sync battle in matching angel and devil outfits to fight for their place in the competition. The world stands poised, waiting to see which of the two rivals will go home and which will continue on. Suddenly, Ru opens her mouth and reveals her decision: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Willam, will you please step forward..."</span></li><li> "Vivienne Pinay... Honey Mahogany... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I'm sending you both home.</span>" Especially notable for the copious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop">Jaw Drops</a> that happened after it.</li><li> When Ru announced at the start of Season 6 that there would be no immunity this season. That is, winning a challenge one week won't protect a queen from being in the bottom two the next.<ul><li> The sting was later taken out of this when BenDeLaCreme was spared from elimination after a particularly bad week due to her previous successes.</li></ul></li><li> Cynthia Lee Fontaine vs. Farrah Moan, in season 9, is an average lip sync, until Ru's decision: "Eureka, would you please step forward?" Eureka, on crutches from hurting her knee in an earlier challenge, obliges, and Ru reveals that given what she's heard about Eureka's knee from the doctor, she can't, in good conscience, allow her to keep competing. Everyone is horrified, but to soften the blow, Ru drops another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>, and extends an open invitation to Eureka for <em>next</em> season, which she accepts.</li><li> Later in season 9, Ru stops production during the lip sync between Nina Bo'nina Brown and Valentina because Valentina's been wearing a veil throughout the performance:<div class="indent"><strong>Ru</strong>: Valentina. This is a lip sync for your life, we need to see your lips. Take that thing off of your mouth. <br><strong>Valentina</strong>: I'd like to keep it on, please.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">Wham Shot</a>:<ul><li> A common runway tactic involves a queen initially hiding part of their outfit before suddenly revealing it to (hopefully) shock and impress the judges with what they were covering. Examples include Detox turning around to reveal that her dress didn't cover her butt, and any queen who makes use of a tearaway.</li><li> During a lip sync against Alyssa Edwards, Roxxxy Andrews infamously pulled off her wig only to reveal she was wearing <em>another</em> wig underneath it. Both Ru and Michelle were left astounded, and Alaska ended up making fun of this moment in a later challenge.</li><li> During her season 9 semi-final lip sync, perennial underdog Sasha Velour first tears the petals from a rose, then removes one then the other glove, creating small showers of rose petals. At a climactic moment, she removes her wig and a huge volume of rose petals cascade down, in one of the most famous reveals in the show's herstory. And that's how Sasha eliminated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the season's frontrunner, Shea Coul&eacute;e.</span></li><li> All Stars 3, Episode 6: BenDeLaCreme begins to pull out the lipstick with the name of the queen she chose to eliminate... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and reveals her own name written in on the lipstick tube. Combine with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> of "I'm going home".</span></li><li> There's another Wham Shot that turns the same season's finale on its head, when Morgan McMichaels reveals which of the final four contestants the eliminated queens chose to be in the final two, and pulls out the lipsticks: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kennedy Davenport, and Trixie Mattel. To the surprise of many (<em>especially</em> Trixie) the jury chose to unceremoniously eliminate the season's clear frontrunner, Shangela.</span></li><li> Season 11's final two, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yvie Oddly and Brooke Lynn Hytes,</span> go head to head in the last lipsync of the season.

Michelle: "They're 'Rolodex' to me.") ganging up on Jinkx when they're in the top four.</li><li> Visage called out her queens again after <em>All Stars</em> after she got to watch exactly how they were treating Mimi Imfurst backstage, she said she was disappointed in Pandora for given up on her partner, and appalled at how the other queens could outright bully one of their own.</li><li> Michelle even expressed her disapproval towards Ru when she named Adore and Laganja as the winners of the makeup commercial challenge, since Michelle (and most viewers) thought Bianca and Trinity had the superior commercial.<ul><li> And for a double dose of this trope, immediately after Michelle's quip, both Laganja and guest judge Leah Remini call Michelle out on her bad attitude about the win, Leah even pushing Michelle and playfully calling her a "nasty bitch".</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellCastingAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellCastingAgency">What The Hell, Casting Agency?</a>: The other queens' in-universe reaction to team captain Adore's casting choices in Season 6's Scream Queens challenge, such as casting April as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbian</a> despite not being the least bit butch, or not casting Vivacious as the mother even though she was the oldest one in the group.

Despite claiming the tears were real, the other queens (namely Sharon Needles and Phi Phi O'Hara) called them out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrocodileTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrocodileTears">Crocodile Tears</a>.</li><li> The other queens would accuse Jinkx Monsoon of this when she complained about her critiques on the runway, since she always seemed to perform well in the challenges (she was constantly in the top three). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Possible aversion</a>, as Jinkx has stated that her insecurities were genuine, and not a ploy to play the other girls.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">Writing Around Trademarks</a>: Forced on New York girls Brita Filter and Jan Sport when they both ended up on season 12 together, resulting in them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">dropping the second halves of their drag names</a> to be just "Brita" and "Jan". Both of them play up the names they had to change when they enter the Werk Room, with Brita downing a cocktail glass full of water and Jan coming in dressed as a cheerleader with a sequined backpack.

While most of the competitors initially tried to camp it up, Dan kept criticizing them and their proposals as if they were legitimate candidates. Several queens were flustered by this and turned in sub-par performances.</li><li> During Season 5's perfume challenge, Aubrey O'Day would constantly criticize the queens while they tried to perform in their commercials when she felt they were being too campy or silly (acting like the queens were actually making real perfume ads). The comedy queens seemed to just ignore her and did their own thing, but the more serious queens appeared shaken by this and ended up turning in less than stellar commercials as a result.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook">Wrote the Book</a>: In one episode, Michelle Visage is introduced by Ru saying that when it comes to being a diva, Michelle wrote the book.

An example would be Phi Phi O'Hara's "Dog Park Realness", that got high marks despite looking like an Anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> with a pink-glittered pooper scooper. (Santino even calls Phi Phi's look out on its lack of "realness", but Rose McGowan tells him she has no interest in anything real, and in the end, the outfit still receives positive feedback overall.)<ul><li> The term realness itself goes back to the ballroom scene and originally meant that someone could pass for straight/cisgender to non-queer people.
