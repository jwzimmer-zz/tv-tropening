On the plus side, this fact also lets someone put it back on the box to render it harmless... if they knew that the box is made of leather, which is technically skin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>:<ul><li> Mrs. Frederic hasn't aged a day for at least a century or so, thanks to her connection to the Warehouse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The finale shows that Claudia gets it too.</span></li><li> The Count De Saint-Germain, his wife, and her son apparently gained similar immortality through the Philosopher's Stone, with the added benefit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that takes care of things like poison or broken necks.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I.

Not only does he control the Warehouse, but he's spent 500 years turning it into his own personal laboratory/house of horrors where human experimentation is the go-to method of testing pretty much anything.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: Seems to be the standard operating procedure for the Regents (who outrank and can overrule the agents).<ul><li> At least one of them (Theodora Stanton) works as a cafe waitress.</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Arty:</strong> This waitress is a Regent?!? <br><strong>Benedict Valda:</strong> John Adams was a farmer. Abraham Lincoln was a small-town lawyer. Plato, Socrates were teachers. Jesus was a carpenter. To equate judgement and wisdom with occupation is at best ... insulting. <br><strong>Arty:</strong> Yeah, I... err... That's not... What I meant... <br><strong>Benedict Valda:</strong> I know what you meant. Who would <em>you</em> have control the warehouse? Kings? Popes? Politicians? (<em>scoffs</em>) There'd be nothing left of it.</div><ul><li> Another one, Pete's mother is an elementary school teacher.

H.G. Wells betrays the team, the kind of thing Pete's vibes should have picked up on as they have before.

In "Regrets", she tries to change a light bulb by using a magnetic artifact to scale the Warehouse's steel girders. Subverted when it is revealed that each time the artifact comes into contact with something metal, the power doubles, threatening to collapse the entire Warehouse. Played straight with a snowglobe that releases quick-freezing snow (she uses it to cool drinks in "Breakdown") and Benjamin Franklin's electricity-amplifying ring (which she uses to turn her hand into a flashlight in "13.1"). One of the things she plays with most frequently are the Teslas; she constantly innovates on it, making a mini-Tesla, a Tesla grenade and rifle, even a fake ID Tesla which shoots when it's rubbed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalAssassin">Musical Assassin</a>: Pretty much any musical instrument, recording, or studio equipment (like the Studio 54 Disco ball, seen in "Duped") in the Warehouse is most likely the tool of such a person.<ul><li> Napoleon's violin, featured in "Personal Effects", can incite an entire town to violence if its user plays a G# note, according to Artie.

After Artie finds this out, he tells about how close he came to the same catastrophe, in his case by 17 seconds.</li><li> In the first episode of Season 3, Pete tells Jinks about a time he tried on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s hat and was overcome with the desire to "free" Mrs. Frederic.

Myka immediately demands details but Artie shuffles them out the door. We may never know the truth...</li><li> In "Endless", there are flashbacks to each agent's "defining moment" during their tenure. All of them are scenes we haven't seen before, and Myka and Steve's moments involve this trope.

Artifacts are stored in a way that they won't activate, away from ones they'd clash with, and the super dangerous ones are quarantined. The agents know not to touch them, and the Warehouse itself is isolated enough that civilians won't wander into it.</li><li> "Fractures" features the most inexcusably unsafe gas station ever. The villain of the episode is able to casually spray gasoline everywhere (you can only do this with a diesel pump, which she is not using), and the shutoff valve is a ridiculously hard to turn wheel, instead of the very simple and faster button which all modern stations use.</li><li> In "Second Chance", Myka mentions the OSHA along with a few other agencies when she threatens a steel mill owner known for his unscrupulous business practices.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">No Party Like a Donner Party</a>: In "Insatiable", a glass jar used by the Donner party shows up as an artifact.

By all logic just keeping the place as clean as it is should take a force of hundreds, much less keeping all the unique technologies they use in working order and the periodic attempts by the artifacts to escape under control. In the beginning of the series the entire maintenance crew, mechanical division, IT division, mission control, and field agent force is...

She never visibly breaks any laws of physics; she's just very good at suddenly being in the same place you are, at the moment you least expect it. Her exits are usually mundane, but at one point she leaves through an open doorway and somehow vanishes in the five seconds it takes Artie to walk over and look through it. Her usage of this is in fact so much a part of her character that Artie and Steve believe that something is seriously wrong when she <em>doesn't</em> do it.</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Artie:</strong> How does she <em>do</em> that?</div><ul><li> In "Breakdown", there's a wide shot of Artie sitting outside a restaurant.

Called attention to in that Taka, a non-regent agent seen in "Beyond Our Control", is shown walking into the very same room that Valda just teleported into.</li><li> Artie seems to be learning the trick too in the season 3 finale when he busts Claudia trying to hack the Atlas-66 file.<div class="indent"> <strong>Claudia:</strong> Did you just Mrs. Frederic me?</div></li><li> Mrs. Frederic does this again in "The Ones You Love" with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jinks</span>.

Claudia's worst fear is revealed to be that she's still in the asylum, about to be given electroshock therapy, and that the Warehouse was all a delusion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenThingsSpinScienceHappens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenThingsSpinScienceHappens">When Things Spin, Science Happens</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a> in "Where and When."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference">Whole Plot Reference</a>: "The Greatest Gift" to the titular story, the basis of "It's a Wonderful Life."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">Who Wants to Live Forever?</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Countess Saint-Germaine's motivation.

The way he engineered his own capture was pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman,</a> but how he dealt with individual artifacts, (i.e., he benefited whether or not he managed to acquire them) was more Xanatos.</li><li> And not only that, but he manages to disguise his <em>real</em> plan with <em>successful</em> Gambits, in increasingly awesome acts.</li><li> In Season 3 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sykes pulls off one to destroy the Warehouse. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Marcus</a> fires Black Barty's cannon at the Warehouse, which Artie says could destroy it.
