And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of Don's new girlfriend at the end of that episode is highly reminiscent of the reveal at the end of the pilot that he's married with a family.</li><li> When Don is in the doldrums and drinking in a seedy bar after a failed attempt to reconcile with Sally in "In Care Of," Don Cherry's "Band Of Gold," the first song that played in the series premiere, is heard in the background to remind how far down America and Don's life has taken a tumble since the start of the decade.</li><li> In series finale "Person to Person", Don tries to comfort Stephanie, who is wracked with guilt over abandoning her child, by telling her to move forward.

References are frequently made toward future real-life events.<ul><li> In one of the first, there's a discussion of the virtues of one of the 1960 presidential candidates, describing him as a "young, handsome, Navy hero." Most of the audience think they're talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F.

The irony of this is that the episode takes place in August 1962: Patterson's next two fights, in September 1962 and July 1963, were both brutal first-round knockout losses to Sonny Liston.</li><li> The clueless call forwards to Vietnam are possibly the saddest, for instance with Joan's husband Greg deciding to become an Army surgeon and citing that he'll have job security in years to come, especially if this Vietnam thing is "still going on." Don, writing in his journal, hopes that Vietnam won't become another Korea.</li><li> Joan's speech in "The Summer Man" to Rizzo, Bill, and Joey telling them that when they're over in Vietnam next year, and they're being shot at and dying, they'll beg for someone (i.e. her) to make their lives easier.</li><li> In Season 4 SCDP added Honda cars to their portfolio, a "motorcycle with doors" in 1965 which is now a full-line marque with a high reputation and little dependence on low-profit fleet sales. Contrast that to the agency's "jewel in the crown" Lucky Strike: in 1960 a market leader and one of the best-known brands in the country, in 2010 a ghost brand in a product segment over 80% of the population wants nothing to do with.</li><li> There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">Call-Forward</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in Season 2 about Martinson Coffee and their concern that young people aren't going to drink coffee in the future.</li><li> In "The Flood", this is mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke">Historical In-Joke</a> when Peggy's realtor promises her that the Second Avenue Subway would increase the value of the apartment she was trying to buy.

(Construction started in 2007 and the first phase of the line, 96th Street to 63rd Street, opened on January 1, 2017.)</li><li> In "The Strategy", a McCann exec says of Burger Chef that "It's not McDonald's.

He sees opportunities in "the Negro market" (as Don calls it) that no one else at the firm does. Socially, he turns from a naive, ignorant WASP kid in a suit who cheats on his wife into a savvy businessman, a genuine liberal, and a devoted husband. But just when it looks like Pete has really evolved as a person, in season 5 he takes a giant step backward, becoming profoundly unhappy with life with his beautiful wife and new baby, patronizing hookers, screwing neighborhood housewives, getting his ass beat by Lane Pryce, etc. Eventually Pete's suburban ennui winds up getting him separated from his gorgeous, awesome wife.</li><li> Joan starts off as a Libby-like figure, and becomes much more sympathetic later on when we find out that she's wasted the prime of her life as a mistress for her boss and ended up being raped by her fianc&eacute; right before their wedding. She later finds out that her "big catch" is an incompetent surgeon who ends up getting unofficially blacklisted from working as a surgeon in New York. He then joins the Army right as the Vietnam War is about to heat up in order to continue pursuing his career dream, even though Joan would be content if he would just become a regular doctor. Finally, in "Mystery Date", Joan dumps her husband and makes it clear to him that she remembers the rape and that it was a mistake to marry him. It's a huge growth moment for the character.<ul><li> Likewise, in the pilot episode, Joan makes clear to Peggy that the goal of the women in the office is to find a husband who can buy them a house away from the city, herself included. By the end of the series, Joan has turned down proposals from Bob Benson, Roger Sterling, and Richard Burghoff and is starting her own business.</li></ul></li><li> At first, Ken Cosgrove is basically a fratboy, consistently crude and immature, constantly hitting on women in the most brazen way possible. Oh, and he has <em>tremendous</em> false modesty about his literary achievements when <em>The Atlantic</em> publishes his short story. When he shows up again at SCDP, he is far more mature &mdash; probably the most mature of the junior people who aren't Peggy &mdash; keeping a strict wall between personal and professional and actually being <em>embarrassed</em> by his fiction (which, admittedly, are <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Betty is usually not a very good or caring mom, but in this episode she's nothing but sweet and supportive and explains to Sally that she's become a woman and that it only means that everything is working normally.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief">Five Stages of Grief</a>: In "The Milk And Honey Route", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Betty is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.</span> Henry is in denial, trying to use his political connections to find a cure, while Betty goes straight to acceptance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a>: This is how we learn Don's whole backstory.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">Flat "What"</a>: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsJSRP7cZVo">Don has a penchant for these<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><ul><li> Peggy has two of these when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stan confesses that he's in love with her</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird">Flipping the Bird</a>: Stan does this to Peggy in "To Have and to Hold" after finding out that she used information he told her in confidence to get an advantage at work.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: Ted Chaough is built as the anti-Draper in Season 6; an unbroken creative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">ace</a> (he even flies planes) who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantHoldHisLiquor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantHoldHisLiquor">Can't Hold His Liquor</a> if he tries to keep up with Don and an overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> friend of his friends who is set to correct his mistakes before they spiral out of control.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> In season three, Sterling Cooper successfully woos the city of New York for the Madison Square Garden project, only to be shot down by Putnam, Powell, &amp; Lowe.

The merger allows the agency to win the Chevy contract, but it creates massive stresses among the partners, with Cutler being on the verge of taking control of the agency.</li><li> Opening a California office brings in a lot of new business and Pete and Ted get away from the problems they have in New York. However, the separation only increases the tension in the agency and both Pete and Ted end up miserable.</li><li> Taking out a newspaper ad to attack one of their competitors after their employees are caught racially abusing some civil rights protesters gets SCDP some favorable publicity... and roughly two dozen African-Americans showing up looking for employment, forcing the already struggling agency to hire one as a secretary just so they don't look like hypocrites.

His relationships with his mistresses are unsympathetic and Betty is devastated when she finds out.</li><li> Roger's cheating on Mona is pretty terrible &mdash; even though very few people disapprove of his relationship with Joan, his affair with Jane is cringeworthy. After marrying Jane, he impregnates Joan but fails to rekindle their old relationship.</li><li> Pete only cheats on Trudy three times in the first four seasons, which is such a low tally by the standards of this show that if not for one of them being all-important to the plot, we might never have noticed. He almost doubles that tally in season 5, though.</li><li> Harry cheating on his wife <em>once</em>, under the influence of alcohol and an office party, results in him getting kicked out of the house. They're back together by early the following season, but considering that a year and a half lapsed between "Nixon v. Kennedy" and "The Benefactor," we don't know how long it took for Jennifer to forgive Harry. He cheats again in season five, and this time seems a lot less hesitant to do so and a lot less guilty about it afterwards.</li><li> As mentioned above, Joan is married to Greg when she cheats on him with Roger. This is treated somewhat sympathetically because of Greg's previous rape of Joan and while Roger may be a jerk, he's been shown to care for her greatly. Then, in Season Five, she divorces Greg, but is still technically married to him when she sleeps with Herb Rennet, the head of Jaguar, to land SCDP the account.</li><li> Betty's one night stand in "Meditations in an Emergency" and flirtation with Henry Francis throughout season 3 are treated sympathetically. Of course, Betty has it coming from another direction entirely...</li><li> Don's affair with Sylvia comes across very negatively. But when Peggy seduces a married man (Ted Chaough), it's treated much more sympathetically, to the point where Peggy is outraged when Chaough goes back to his wife.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodbyeCruelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodbyeCruelWorld">Goodbye, Cruel World!</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">rather fitting one</a> for Lane Pryce:</span><div class="indent"><strong>Roger</strong>: A resignation letter.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining times Pete is kicked is when he picks a fight with Lane, likely thinking he'd be too mild mannered to respond. Lane, tired of putting up with Pete, socks him a couple good ones in the nose, humiliating him in front of everyone.<ul><li> Don himself has some pretty low points, especially in season 6.

Rachel starts falling in love with him, but breaks it off when Don offers to run away with her without any consideration for his wife or kids.</li><li> Joan Holloway and Roger Sterling have a long and passionate love affair. He is one of the bosses in their advertising agency and married with a teen daughter while she is a single secretary (who more or less runs the office as an unofficial office manager). Some people know, for example Roger's older business partner Mr. Cooper tells Joan she should not waste her youth, but most are oblivious to the relationship. They break up when Joan gets engaged. Roger continues to have a soft spot for Joan. They later have a baby together after they sleep together once, and Roger tries to tag along.</li><li> Roger starts a romance with Jane, Don's new hot secretary. Roger gets divorced and marries Jane very soon after. It was a great surprise for everyone in the office.</li><li> In season 2, Don Draper has an ugly affair with Bobbie Barrett, a wife and manager to an obnoxious comedian Jimmy. The relationship started as professional but they soon begin sleeping together. Jimmy strongly suspects they slept together, and Don's copy writer Peggy also finds out about the affair. Don ends their relationship after he learns she's been gossiping about him.</li><li> Don Draper, still married to Betty, romantically pursues Susan Ferrell, his daughter's young idealistic teacher. She resists &mdash; at first. Later she is sorry they can't date publicly for fear that they would be seen. Susan's brother visits her when they are together and figures out something is off. Don breaks it off when his marriage starts crumbling.</li><li> Don starts sleeping with Faye Miller. She is a marketing researcher hired by SCDP, and probably the healthiest of Don's post-divorce relationships. They kept it secret from all people in the office, and not many knew about it because Faye left the job when SCDP lost their tobacco account.</li><li> Megan starts at SCDP as Don's new secretary, they sleep together and very soon Don decides to marry her, as he was infatuated with her model looks, magical-nanny abilities and desire to work in advertising as a copy writer. Many people are so surprised when he announces the engagement that they don't even know who Megan is.</li><li> Ted Chaough has an affair with Peggy, his head writer. He wants to leave his wife for her, but breaks it off very soon and leaves Mannhatten. He insists he loves her deeply, but Penny is very hurt by his treatment of her.</li><li> Pete (married to Trudy) has an affair with a young depressed housewife. Her husband eventually finds out and he and Pete have a fight on a train.</li><li> Don Draper sleeps with Sylvia Rosen, an older but beautiful housewife of a doctor who live in the same building as Don and his wife Megan.

She has an affair with Paul Kinsey, but ends it because he bragged about her, a one-night stand with Harry Crane, and has a lengthy affair (covering a period of years) with professional partner Roger Sterling. Although Joan and Roger's relationship is loving, she implies later that she viewed sex as her purpose, as she feels intense guilt for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lane's suicide</span> because she feels she could have stopped it if she slept with him. However, Joan actually goes out of her way to tell her partners that she doesn't intend for them to leave their wives.</li><li> Don starts off as a subversion (he genuinely believes he can run away with Rachel in Season 1 and loses interest in Midge when he realizes she's in love with someone else).

Don epitomizes this trope, but pretty much all male staff in the corporate world, outside most of creative, are always seen in suits of different cuts.

For one, they started off as young women with a rather childlike 50s state of dress with their brown hair in ponytails and with a relationship with a father/mentor figure, the name "Margaret", parents that want them married, having sacrificed motherhood for a more fulfilling adult life, and slightly Joan wanting them to pick up some style tips from her; the resemblance ends there with Peggy having a more direct approach (especially later on) towards things she's entitled to (the directness impressing Roger) and having been trying to make peace with having her baby taken away, Roger also shares his working life with Peggy and has a night of bonding before they move on to McCann Erickson, Peggy lacks the relationship Margaret has with her father because he died before her 13th birthday, she didn't go down the traditional path her family wanted for her, and she develops a medium between the counter culture and the more traditional adult life set by her era albeit one that doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">place her in the home</a>; Margaret was Daddy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> who looked like a miniature of her Mother, got married after high school, has a strained relationship with her father, did the job her parents expected her to do (get married), yet later leaves her husband and young son for a hippie commune and becomes "Marigold".</li><li> Peggy to Joan: hard-working, they both lost their fathers and were raised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">critical</a> mothers in a lower-middle class environment, both worked their way out of the secretarial pool while dealing with the misogyny of their workplaces, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">both lied about their sexual history to their boyfriends</a>, rarely seen with genuine female office friendships, were impregnated by one of the SC&amp;P partners, both are smokers with a sharp wit and intellect to match, and both end the series with their careers on top and with their stars rising.<ul><li> Peggy grew up in a devout Catholic environment in Brooklyn with her mother and sister, witnessed her father die, went to secretarial school after high school, experiments with the counter culture, she works in a more creative field (also one that is more open-minded about women in positions other than secretary), both have depended on the Men giving the thumbs up to advance, and tries not to play up her sensuality at work and dresses more simply. She also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets a guy (Stan) who loves her for who she is and isn't threatened by her strength and talents but appreciates them</span>, was separated from her baby, and is on the fast track to become Creative Director (if Pete's predictions, good chance, are correct).</li><li> Joan was raised by a mother who raised her to be "admired" by men and likely saw her father leave the family, she had two failed marriages, went to college and moved to New York from Spokane, is more conventional in attitude than Peggy, works as a partner and under accounts, dresses sexily and uses her womanly wiles to get things done, takes great pride in being "the most gorgeous" woman in the office, raised her baby under the guise of being conceived by her and Greg, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> breaks off with yet another man that wants to keep her as a woman of leisure and not work, and starts her own production agency</span>.</li></ul></li><li> Rachel Menken and Betty Draper in the 1st season: well-educated, both lost their mothers, came from very comfortable backgrounds, Daddy's little princesses, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> soon die from cancer</span>, and involved with Don. But Rachel grew up motherless and quite lonely, is Jewish, urban, fights for her familys' business and what she's entitled to, is more open and kinder, relies on her intelligence rather than looks, and finally got the husband and children she's always wanted without sacrificing her career.

But while Betty tries to look perfect and is tearing up inside, Francine acknowledges more of her own insecurities and how imperfect her life is; Betty was a glamorous model in Manhattan who spent a year in Italy while Francine was a schoolteacher somewhere less glamorous. Francine is more honest and aggressive, has a healthier relationship with her children for the most part, confronts her husband and stays married to him, and later becomes a working mom when she attempts a real estate exam and starts her own travel agency. Betty maintains that facade, is very cold to her children, divorces Don and marries another man quickly, and voices skepticism about being a working mother and wife before starting on a Masters in Psychology.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesGotLegs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesGotLegs">She's Got Legs</a>: Megan does a sexy song and dance for Don while wearing a very short miniskirt and fishnet stockings at his surprise party.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">Ship Sinking</a>:<ul><li> Don and Joan after Don fires Jaguar without consulting anyone.</li><li> For Pete and Peggy in the season two finale.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>:<ul><li> Don kisses Joan square on the mouth when he wins the Clio in "Waldorf Stories."</li><li> After Joan gets served with divorce papers in "Christmas Waltz", Don takes her out on the town.

Most of the main characters are either corporate executives or corporate executives' wives, for God's sake! More specifically, Matthew Weiner is interested in using the "visual vocabulary" of the early Sixties, which had the slightest tendency to over-shiny things, but on account of the realistic depiction, it provides a bit of dissonance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">Slipping a Mickey</a>: Don falls victim to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">Outlaw Couple</a> of thieves in a hotel room ("Seven Twenty-Three").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy">Slouch of Villainy</a>:<ul><li> Though Roger Sterling is not much of a villain, his remarkable assholism is often underscored by his postures when he's using a chair or a couch.</li><li> The credits, art box DVDs, and promotional materials feature images and scenes of Don reclined on a couch in a decidedly antiheroic, jaded way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a>:<ul><li> The men are free to romp, so long as they're discreet, and other men don't particularly care, but if a woman steps one toe over the line, she's torn apart.

Pete actually seems to respect her <em>more</em>. They had to, since the partners &#150; with the exception of Don &mdash; were the ones who coerced her into doing it. Joan's visibly uncomfortable with the whole thing before and during the act, but only accepted it because of the financial security for her and her son (she got a partnership of the company and a voting equity stake in the partnership out of it).</li><li> In "Severance".

Don is the Lord: he makes partner in Season 1, and is officially at the top of his field; he wants to be great, but he now has so much to lose (and he loses a lot). Cooper is the Prophet, satisfied with his life (except for that operation), wanting only to secure his legacy in the form of leaving a healthy firm. Roger is in the middle of transitioning from Lord to Prophet: at first uncomfortable with his increasing irrelevance, he gradually settles in to a role as "Professor Emeritus of Accounts" and leaves the heavy lifting to Pete and Ken.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThreeFacesOfEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThreeFacesOfEve">The Three Faces of Eve</a>: Deconstructed with the main female characters from Season 1 to 4:<ul><li> Betty appears to be the Wife, literally Don's wife and the mother of his children. However, it is immediately obvious that she is unstable, deeply unhappy, and unsuited to the role of motherhood.

By season 2, she fits the surprising mould of The Seductress much more closely, as she has had a baby with the married Pete out of wedlock. Then, by Season 4, she has become the most stable and professional woman in the cast, and thus fits the role of the Wife much more easily, despite being single and constantly unlucky in love.</li><li> Joan is initially the Seductress, Roger's hotblooded and sexual mistress, but even midway through Season 1 it is clear that she is in fact much more like the Wife, as a stable, constant, and intelligent influence upon Sterling Cooper, and especially Roger and Don.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">Threatening Shark</a>: Both of Pete's parents die at sea and within the respective episodes for each death someone makes sure to point that it was possible, nay, probable that they were eaten by sharks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex">Three-Way Sex</a>: Don, Megan, and Megan's friend Amy in Season 7's "The Runaways &mdash; at Megan's insistence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a>: In-universe with two different minorities. The sarcastic "equal opportunity employer" ad in Season 5 premiere "A Little Kiss" basically forces lily-white SCDP to integrate, and in "Tea Leaves" Dawn the secretary has been hired as their first black employee. In the same episode, SCDP hires a Jewish copywriter, which Roger thinks makes the business seem more "modern". (In the first season Sterling Cooper had to pluck some random Jewish employee out of the mailroom when meeting with the Jewish owners of Menken's department store.)<ul><li> Dawn is basically the Token Minority in a meta-sense as well, given her lack of storyline (apart from that one scene with Peggy) and the continuing whiteness of the rest of the cast. She does get some background characterization, which is more than we can say about the other secretaries (except, of course, for the ones who are no longer secretaries). Also, by Season 7, she is also joined by another black secretary.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise">Tomato Surprise</a>: The ending of the very first episode.

Joan takes great pride in looking sexy and feminine: curve hugging clothing, elaborate yet work-appropriate up-dos, perfect make-up, and the beginning of the series has her aiming for more traditional feminine goals and shows her shakingly harnessing her power as a partner. Peggy, while not the traditional image of the tomboy, dresses in a manner that more or less mimics menswear (when it's not schoolgirl or simple dresses) and is short haired with some basic makeup. She takes charge more at work and one time asked Dawn "Do you think I act like a man?" only to be told by the latter that it might be necessary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>:<ul><li> Peggy in Season 2, she gets Freddy Rumsen's office (much to Harry "I'm Head of Television!"

He purposely sabotages a deal with Honda when his colleagues go behind him for the good of their company and has an emotional talk about it with Joan later on who tells him to leave it behind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyChild">Trophy Child</a>: Don and Betty Draper seem to be the living embodiment of the wholesome 1960s nuclear family with a professional dad, a stay at home mom, and two perfect kids, one girl and one boy. However, the Drapers are more in love with the idea of marriage and children than their actual spouse and kids. Neither spends much time with their children and the emphasis is placed on the children looking immaculate and behaving well at all times. Once Don and Betty have their third child and divorce, the kids are used at chess pieces to punish each other with most of the child care falling to nannies and respective step-parents. In one episode, both Don and Betty and their respective spouses spend most of the episode thinking the other is taking care of the kids while the kids are actually in Don's apartment with a house burglar who is pretending to be an old friend of Don's while actually robbing the place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife">Trophy Wife</a>: Jane Siegel Sterling is a perfect example.

When Don comes back, she's one of the few members of the creative team to antagonize Don by telling him they've been functioning just fine since his absence. Most of this hostility stems from resentment toward Don for breaking her and Ted up, even though Ted was the one who truly instigated the breakup out of unwillingness to break up his family.
