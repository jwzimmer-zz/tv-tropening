It also moved on from a fairly straightforward forensics approach to more high-tech approaches that aren't necessarily possible in real life, requiring some degree of suspension of disbelief from the viewer. <em>CSI</em> runs into the Road of Trials (Part of Hero's Journey) many time throughout the series. <em>CSI</em> as a forensic/mystery show continued for many years, holding on very strongly and getting more interesting with time.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">influenced a great many subsequent programs</a>, particularly in the early 2000s to the early 2010s, where police procedurals involving large casts of characters, often focused around a specific type of crime/evidence/investigation methods were for a while a large mainstay of TV programming. Most directly, it inspired its producer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryBruckheimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryBruckheimer">Jerry Bruckheimer</a>, to try and replicate this success with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> (both in the same verse). It also followed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>'s "franchise" footsteps, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Yeeeeeeeaaaahh!</a></em>), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber">CSI: Cyber</a></em>. There are 797 total episodes of <em>CSI</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber">CSI: Cyber</a></em>, not including books, comic books, and video games related to the franchise. Please note, however, that it is not the oldest of the current crop of forensic shows, a title held by British show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SilentWitness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SilentWitness">Silent Witness</a></em>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Gil Grissom's frequent one-liners right before the opening credits or an ad break are a well known example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuipToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuipToBlack">Quip to Black</a>, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">Horatio Caine's</a> versions are perhaps the best known - mostly due to the heaping layer of cheese added to them.

As a result, the uninformed juror will assume that what they see on the show is happening <em>as it actually occurs</em>, as opposed to being fabricated and accelerated for television. It's also sometimes created difficulties in crime-fighting, since the show shining the limelight on forensic techniques (aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a> notwithstanding) has prompted higher-end criminals to take steps to minimize what forensic evidence they leave behind (e.g. wearing gloves to avoid fingerprints).</p><p>The show aired a total of 15 seasons before being cancelled in May 2015. A two-hour movie to conclude the show's run aired on September 27, 2015, which brought back original stars William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger.</p><p>CBS has been discussing a 20th anniversary revival run of the series, but it&#146;s currently unknown whether it will happen or what effect the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 may have on any plans.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This show provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">Abnormal Ammo</a>: One episode had bullets made of frozen ground beef.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">Absentee Actor</a>: William Petersen's absence in a series of episodes brought in Liev Schreiber as Petersen took a break from <em>CSI</em> while he starred in a play called <em>Dublin Carol</em>, a twist on Dickens' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> in Providence, R.I. The episode "Gum Drops" was changed when Petersen left town due to a death in the family. The focuses of the episode changed from Grissom to Nick being certain Cassie was alive. "Genetic Disorder" was changed from a Nick-centric episode to a Greg-centric one when George Eads left town for his father's funeral.<ul><li> On "Gum Drops", given what Nick himself had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">been through</a> and how he could empathize with her plight, this change was probably an improvement. "Genetic Disorder" becoming Greg-centric can be seen as an improvement as well, as it shows how much Greg has matured as a person and as an investigator over the past decade. He ultimately refuses to jump to conclusions, waits to get official results, and calls other characters out for assuming Doc Robbins is guilty of something (Hodges and Brass). Compare this to a season 1 episode where Greg actually does jump to a conclusion about a couple, and he is found wrong about it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">Accidental Hero</a>: Witnesses who unknowingly obtain or provide useful evidence have made life infinitely easier for the CSIs on multiple occasions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">Accidental Murder</a>: One episode features an accident <em>made to look like</em> a murder.

At least, that's what Dominic <em>thinks</em> is happening. In truth, between his knowledge and his quirky behavior, the team considers him the prime suspect and Dominic goes along, even drawing how the bomb must have been set up, oblivious to how he's implicating himself. When a public defender tries to end a talk, Dominic just brushes her off as "they're being good to me." The team, meanwhile, come to the idea that Dominic is actually playing a twisted game of openly confessing without evidence to play them.<ul><li> It gets to the point where, after a conversation Dominic clearly doesn't realize is actually an interrogation, Grissom openly says he can't tell if the guy is a mastermind playing them or "just crazy."</li><li> The answer comes when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dominic dies stopping a bomb from going off in a school and the team realize he really was a hero trying to help them out.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid">You Need to Get Laid</a>: When Nick jokingly tells his nerdy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LabRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LabRat">Lab Rat</a> coworkers they need to get a girlfriend, it backfires both times.

Yeah...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou">A Winner Is You</a>: After you beat a case with 100% completion, you usually just get Grissom telling you, that doesn't happen often, and that he's very impressed. If you don't get 100%, he just berates you and tells you to try better next time. To be fair though, it is <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">in character</a> for Grissom to give you such a bare minimum evaluation. In the games made after William Petersen's departure Catherine gives you a more glowing evaluation, making you feel like you really accomplished something. However, she pretty much says the same thing regardless if you get 100% or not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackTracking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackTracking">Back Tracking</a>: The amount of times you have to keep going back to a crime scene, or a suspect's place (just to gather more evidence, or get more information) is a little ridiculous and unrealistic, especially when compared to the TV show. The game designers sort of lampshade it though sometimes by having the suspects get <em>really</em> agitated with you everytime you come back to get more info, or look for more evidence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: Each CSI game comes with 5 cases. For every 5th case, a suspect from an earlier case who was later deemed innocent shows back up again, and usually turns out to be heavily involved with the current case, or is the actual murderer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics">Character Tics</a>: Some suspects have these, and they become essential to the case later. One female suspect in one game keeps fidgeting with her fingernails during questioning. It's later revealed because she broke a fake nail, and the broken piece turns up on the victim's dead body.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: The very first CSI game had poor graphics, and the characters just barely resemble the actors from the TV show. The cases were much shorter, and in the first two games, Greg did all DNA, print, and chemical matches for you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>: Practically a <em>fleet</em> of police officers and undercover agents in the game <em>Fatal Conspiracy</em>.</li></ul><p></p><hr>
