He talks about how he's getting old and wonders if it's time to just go out gracefully on a win. The others are disappointed but say they'll respect his choice.

Subverted in "The Father of Jewels", where Sean's plan to con his father relies on his father having this and double-crossing him when he realises the size of their potential haul - except he doesn't, leading to Sean's plan falling apart and a furious Emma taking over.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>: Billy vanishes without explanation between seasons 4 and 5.

Oftentimes it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConWithinACon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConWithinACon">The Con Within a Con</a>, but the structure and payoffs of the group's scams varied enormously over the seasons.

Danny expresses some uncertainty, reminding them that he got shot last time they did one (Series 1 Episode 2).</li><li> Series 3 Episode 5 has the team trying to fool a newspaper into believing an old urban myth about the Royal family. Danny warns them 'I ain't nicking the crown jewels again!' referring to when they did just that in Series 2 Episode 6. This is also referenced in the following episode but is less of a 'nod' and more an explicit explanation of it in order to impress someone.</li><li> Season 8 episode 2 is full of them, including Ash's speech about what great grifters they are, which is mostly a list of previous plotlines; also former recurring character Cyclops puts in his first appearance since season five, and at the end Mickey (jokingly) moots a con involving a fake Mondrian painting, which the original crew already did in season one (he even suggests they use the same forger again).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a>: Granted, this show asks viewers to suspend disbelief on a routine basis - but in "Law and Corruption" flashbacks show that while dropping off goods in a police station for an imprisoned Albert to use as part of their plan, a disguised Stacie just happened to overhear York bragging to his sidekick about the bug in the crew's apartment that they'd never have known about otherwise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>: Mickey considers Britford one, and is able to win at the end of the day by gambling on her not trusting their mark with unnecessary information. Mickey himself occasionally has shades of this, almost rejecting Emma and Sean from the team because he'd had no say in recruiting them (Albert had engineered their meeting), but generally trusts his team.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a>: Albert.

This always ended badly for them. D.I. Fisk in "Curiosity Caught the Kat" is a typical example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>: Deconstructed when Sean and Emma's dad returns. Initially, Sean is convinced that he's just like all the other scumbag marks and sets out to con him accordingly - except it swiftly proves he isn't, and the whole con nearly goes up in flames because Mr. Kennedy never even dreamed of double-crossing his "partner" for the money. When the siblings confront him, he turns out to be a sad case - a genuinely decent man who made a horrible mistake he could never take back when he walked out on them, even though he did try and find them. The group eventually take what they feel Sean and Emma are owed for his never being there, but pointedly don't ruin him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a>: In "A Bollywood Dream", after the current mark realises that he's the target of a scam because the scenario was <em>too</em> perfect moments before he loses his short-term memory in an accident, the group decide to re-do the con making it a bit more imperfect as they acknowledge that a man who seeks perfection would know how hard it is to achieve. With this in mind, they adjust their scam to make the characters involved less prestigious- Mickey's director has a less notable reputation, Stacie's actress studied at a minor college rather than a more prestigious one- while keeping a focus on their original agenda.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogWasTheMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogWasTheMastermind">The Dog Was the Mastermind</a>: In the episode "Conning the Artists" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the honour killing was all an elaborate cover for a con a 10 year old girl came up with so her and her brother could escape their landlord/boss who the team had conned that very week.

After he hands over the cash, the guy looks out the window at what he thinks he's just bought: the London Eye.

They arrange for it to be found by a cleaning lady who gets a big reward. The team's real goal is to sell four perfect replicas of the Diamond to four different buyers. Each one is told the "recovered" Diamond is a fake to soothe the public and they're purchasing the real thing. Each one of them buys the story, allowing the gang to make a fortune.</li><li> The shining example is when Ash temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">Cannot Tell a Lie</a>, and is directly asked by the mark if there's any reason he shouldn't commit his money.

It works too.</li><li> When dealing with 'dieticians' Dean and Dana Deville, the team knew that any scam on the Devilles would have to be carefully planned as the couple were basically scammers themselves. As a result, while they initially made contact as 'art acquisition experts' who would help the Devilles acquire a rare Faberge egg, the larger con was to convince them that they could lead the Devilles to a radical new weight-loss drug. With Ash posing as Mickey's driver, he turned up for each weekly meeting in a progressively smaller fatsuit until he was at his real weight, subsequently claiming to the Devilles that his wife worked for a pharmaceutical company and he stole a product that she was testing. According to 'Philips', the company itself was almost a year away from official human trials, his wife left him before he started using the formula so hadn't seen the change, and he had finished the last of the bottle a couple of days before the current conversation, giving the Devilles incentive to rob the company themselves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>: A minor one, but the first episodes of season 5 heavily imply there's 5 years between Emma and Sean, stating that they've been on the streets since Sean was 9 and Emma 14.

However, instead of Danny turning into Mickey and Billy being a clone of First-Series-Danny, Danny remained as he was and therefore was a very different leader to Mickey, and Billy was a lot less of a cocky newbie, being the only person who seriously respected Danny as a leader and not even dreaming of trying to challenge his position like Danny did to Mickey so many times.</li><li> Then in Series 5, The Danny/Billy role is taken by Sean and Stacie is replaced by Emma, but again both were considerably different characters to their predecessors. In contrast to Danny and Billy who were very enthusiastic about grifting and wanted to build their experience as much as possible, Sean was still having doubts as to whether he even wanted to be a grifter, and when he made a big mistake during his first big con with the gang, offered to leave so as not to ruin Emma's chances. Emma's personality was also quite different to Stacie's, being a lot more sensitive and slightly less flirty (when out of character).</li><li> For a mark example, both Anthony Reeves from the season one finale and Edmund Richardson from the season 6 premier are vocally classist jerks who are hated by the public for getting golden parachutes after ruining their depositors.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong">That Came Out Wrong</a>: This exchange between Emma and Mickey:<div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> How would you like it if I drooled over you?</div><div class="indent">(significant look from Mickey)</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma</strong>: Forget I asked that.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">Throw the Dog a Bone</a>: At the end of "Eat Yourself Slender", Eddie gets a girlfriend.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Stands Still</a>: Frequently used in the earlier seasons, as this will happen in the middle of a scam for a variety of reasons - usually so the team can explain what is happening.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverAsLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverAsLovers">Undercover as Lovers</a>:<ul><li> Sean and Emma give this vibe in their first episode.
