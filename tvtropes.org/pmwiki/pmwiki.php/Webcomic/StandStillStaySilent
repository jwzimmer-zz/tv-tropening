Onni relocating to Mora and eventually giving the "do not leave your space" memo to Reynir makes that idea unlikely to happen... until Chapter 13, when they need help from Onni during the night and Reynir sends his fylgja over to speak through it while staying safely in his space himself.</li><li> In a beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> moment, a single flower is found growing by Emil and Lalli in the middle of the snow, under a pane of glass.

Between the fact that neither cousin seemed surprised upon that first mention and the word 'again' being used, it was pretty clear that this was not the first time Onni and Lalli have been hunted by it. The only confirmed sign of its interference in Adventure I was near the end of that arc's very last chapter; 'It' happens to come close to finding Lalli while the latter is in the spirit sea with no idea where his safe area is, and Lalli gets so focused on not getting noticed by 'It' that he fails to notice that he's swimming towards another danger.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowWereTooBusyCryingOverYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowWereTooBusyCryingOverYou">Not Now, We're Too Busy Crying over You</a>: When the presumed-dead Emil and Lalli make it to the extraction spot that the rest of the crew has reached the previous day, the following things happen in exactly that order:<ul><li> Mikkel opens the door of the barracks to let them in and is so happy to see them that he gives them a big hug here and there.</li><li> Emil asks about the possibility of having a bath, well within hearing range of anyone inside the building.</li><li> Sigrun complains about the cold air getting inside the building because it's distracting her from her mourning over Emil and Lalli.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a>:<ul><li> In Chapter 4, observe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Mikkel</a>'s "please don't, I implore you" expression when Sigrun considers going to Copenhagen at night.

Bypassing this is the reason Trond had to blackmail the merchant ship that was carrying Reynir into doing it in the first place.</li><li> Once Reynir is found in the food crate, Mikkel correctly guesses that the crew will have to keep Reynir before it gets confirmed via official channels, because he knows just arranging for the quarantine ship would take several weeks, and the expedition is intended to last just a few months.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanPunk">Ocean Punk</a>: The Known World has taken that direction compared to the present day:<ul><li> The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingTheSteaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingTheSteaks">Raising the Steaks</a> only concerns mammals makes travel by boat relatively safe compared to travel by land, while air travel was foregone entirely.</li><li> The biggest patch of troll-free land is Iceland, Denmark is now a single small island, the surviving Norwegians live on the country's coasts and Finland's survivors are mostly found in the Saimaa lake system.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddShapedPanel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddShapedPanel">Odd-Shaped Panel</a>: Dreamworld panels are drawn with curvy frames instead of the straight lines of the real-world ones.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>: Minna's trouble with left-right orientation, combined with a tendency to forget small details in the design of recurring characters and objects, leave plenty of space for things getting drawn differently over spans ranging from different chapters to different panels on the same page.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffScreenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffScreenRomance">Offscreen Romance</a>:<ul><li> In the Norway portion of the prologue, the group of four friends that would go on to become Trond's parents and Sigrun's great-grandparents show no signs of being romantically involved.

His prologue ancestor is basically named "&Aacute;rni, Reynir's son", while Reynir himself is "Reynir, &Aacute;rni's son".</li><li> Before the family tree was revealed, the only other main character relative to get an actual portrait aside from the mysterious Hotakainen grandmother was Mikkel's twin brother, who shares the name of their prologue ancestor.</li><li> &Oacute;lafur is the name of both one of Reynir's brothers and the cook on the merchant ship that he was riding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyElectricSheepAreCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyElectricSheepAreCheap">Only Electric Sheep Are Cheap</a>: Inverted. A spare part for a mechanical vehicle can cost as much as a healthy work horse, resulting in mechanical vehicles being used only by the military while civilians go around in horse-drawn carriages.

Emil and Lalli sort of bond over their shared hatred of the bed belts. Later in the night, Lalli hands Emil his belt and tangles himself in his own right before sudden movement of the train projects anyone not strapped to their bed (read: Emil) out of it.</li><li> Sigrun may know when to back down from a fight, but she's also walked into troll nests and killed grosslings, considers a suicide mission to be a relaxing vacation, and through it all has been absolutely fearless. <a class="urllink" href="http://sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=483">So the first time she's shown to be downright terrified<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it's clear that the crew is in <em>serious</em> trouble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven">Turned Up to Eleven</a> the first time we see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Lalli</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=627">look completely terrified<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

After the events of Chapter 13, Lalli is in such need for comfort that, while not directly seeking it out, he picks up Kitty and hugs her when she comes to him.

As such, having the main characters exist at all required one or two generations of people simply being born, finding a mate, and having children of their own between the prologue and the main timeframe. With the cast consisting of six different families taken together, this creates plenty of such characters. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=629">A family tree published after Chapter 12 fills most of the gaps<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<ul><li> Onni, Tuuri and Lalli's grandfather seems to be intentionally this. He's the only person without a last name on the tree and Minna has confirmed it was as literal a one-night stand as one can be, which makes the guy come across as literally existing only to sire a pair of twin boys to Ensi.</li><li> One of the more noticeable pairs is Emil's parents, due to him being Torbj&ouml;rn's nephew.</li><li> Reynir's parents are very likely to have used the same genetical material donor or pair of donors for all four of their older children, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=292">considering how similar they look to each other<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Whoever that person or pair of people is, Reynir owes them the existence of his siblings.</li><li> Most adult prologue characters are either already married or have their future spouse appear in the same segment. The only exception to this is &Aacute;rni Reynisson. Since he's Reynir's great-grandfather, him eventually meeting a woman and starting a family with her is a given.</li><li> The member of the Nordic Concil who lost his glasses and voted "yes" to the expedition's funding because he didn't know what he was voting for. The funding application was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecidedByOneVote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecidedByOneVote">Decided by One Vote</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UntranslatedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UntranslatedTitle">Untranslated Title</a>: The French translation sticks with the original title. Due to French having no direct equivalent to "stand still", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> was translated to the equivalent of "stay immobile and silent". The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeTitle">Alliterative Title</a> would have also been lost if it had been translated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">Unusually Uninteresting Sight</a>:<ul><li> Lalli didn't react at all to Reynir showing up in the food crate.

Mikkel may have started wondering by the end of Chapter 10 (and sleeping through its second half would indeed count as concerning), as Reynir is sharing a mattress with Lalli out in the open, instead of Lalli sleeping under Tuuri's bunk as usual. The author comments say that Mikkel was the one who insisted on these sleeping arrangements.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanRuins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanRuins">Urban Ruins</a>: The variant that's at the crossroads between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinsOfTheModernAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinsOfTheModernAge">Ruins of the Modern Age</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostCity">Ghost City</a>.
