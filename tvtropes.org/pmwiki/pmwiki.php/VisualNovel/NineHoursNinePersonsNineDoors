If you play the game competently the entire time, you don't need to change your dialogue choices so much as line up the correct sequence of doors. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All the choices you're offered while searching for Snake will have absolutely no bearing on the ending you receive, but if you don't know that, then the paths <em>will</em> seem hidden. The fact that the game greys out previously-used choices doesn't help, as it implicitly suggests that your prior choices were wrong.</span></li><li> The fact that even if you choose all of the correct doors and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">give Clover the bookmark</span>, you still won't reach the True Ending if you didn't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">learn about Ice-9 or didn't talk to Seven about it when he mentioned EDT.</span> It really doesn't seem to have any relevance.</li><li> At the actual choosing of doors, there's only one split where one choice doesn't stand out very well as being the "most logical"&mdash;the 7-8 split. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">4 is more logical than 5 because given which characters have already refused to go through the #5 door and which ones have volunteered, the only way to make the groups even in size would be to send June and Junpei through the #4 door with Santa and Lotus&mdash;and given the perceived danger, keeping the groups even seems wisest. It's the right choice. At the 6-1-2 split, the pairs that choose the #1 and #2 doors have digital roots of 5 and 6 respectively and could therefore go through their chosen doors with the addition of Junpei's 5, but the pair that chooses Door #6 has a digital root of 9; the group as a whole has a digital root of 7, so sending groups through the #1 and #6 doors is the only way to make sure everyone goes through a door. Combining these two truths makes Door #1 the "most logical" choice... and again, it's <em>the correct one</em>. The only hint for choosing Door #7 is that you've already explored a room with Lotus, and thus need to go with Seven. Likewise, the path for the Safe Ending involves going through #5 with Seven and Snake, and thus going with Lotus (Door #8) at the next split. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">This all really makes more sense in hindsight</a>.</span></li><li> Also, the final puzzle in the torture room. Two switches each on two separate screens, each with three potential positions, and all four switches must be in the proper position to proceed. Unlike most times, there's no clue in the room as to what the proper configuration is, and because of the screen separation, you could have both switches on your current screen in the right position and not even know it because the switches on the other screen are wrong. This is mitigated in <em>The Nonary Games</em> re-release, where they give you a hint for the correct configuration.</li><li> The final puzzle in <em>The Nonary Games</em> updates the Sudoku puzzle to include hexadecimal letters. Though numerous hints are given regarding how the puzzle works, after a certain point, you will be prompted to simply reset the puzzle upon failing.

Exit doors in some puzzle rooms also appear to work this way.

It has 4 stages, which all share the same mechanics and rules: there are 2 numbered areas and you have to use all balls to match one digital root or the other (each one allowing 3-5 balls), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">which seems an awful lot like players entering numbered doors</a>.

If you try to do so in the 4th stage, which has only 5 balls, you will never solve it. Why is this fair? Because the rules never said that you had to fill both areas. They just stated that each area can contain 3-5 balls.

If you examine the bed three times, Akane will notice the tall bed frame and tell Junpei that they don't have to worry about falling off, since she "tosses and turns when she sleeps". While it is a harmless statement in English, the original phrase in the Japanese version is "negaeri o utsu" (lit. "to strike sleep turns"), also meaning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"to betray", i.e. not only to turn in one's sleep, but also to "turn on somebody"</span>, packing a clever mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> into an arguable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun">Accidental Pun</a>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In Japanese Akane and Aoi mean "red" and "blue", respectively. When code names are chosen, Akane's is "Murasaki" which means "purple" and is derived from the number 6 due to some Japanese wordplay. This also ties into the ending where the voodoo doll is thought by Junpei to be a "budou doll", "budou" meaning "grape". As a result they end up naming it "Murasaki" or "purple". There are consequently numerous instances of the colors red and blue being used throughout the game along with a few cases of combining to form purple.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTranscendsSpacetime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTranscendsSpacetime">Love Transcends Spacetime</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junpei did not previously have a strong connection to the morphogenetic field, but still managed to awaken his potential to send and receive through the field to transmit the information needed to save Akane in the past simply through his bond with her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuminescentBlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuminescentBlush">Luminescent Blush</a>: June is prone to getting these, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">especially when alone with Junpei</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation">Lucky Translation</a>: Akane's Japanese alias is Murasaki (purple, from the 6th color of the rainbow and her clothes), has nothing to do with June, her alias and the sixth month in English. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which makes Junpei's comment about as a child 'not seeing her after June' (the season), foreshadowing.)</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicSquarePuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicSquarePuzzle">Magic Square Puzzle</a>: There's a 3x3 square that must be filled with the numbered pins you find in the Cargo room.
