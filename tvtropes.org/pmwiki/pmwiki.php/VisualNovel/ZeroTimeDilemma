Also, as in <em>999</em> and <em>VLR</em>, you can fast-forward through dialogue you've already seen.</li><li> In one scene, C-Team needs to roll 1 on three dice simultaneously. While the first few attempts at this are truly random, the game will, after the player has reloaded a few times, rig the result to the desired outcome, rather than force the player through even more attempts with a 1/216 chance of success.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: The demo shown during GDC showcased the new moral dilemma mechanics, which forces the player to make decisions that risk the lives of the participants. According to the developers, the outcome of some of these scenarios are randomized, meaning any of the characters could die regardless of their status in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em>.

Delta planned to release Radical-6 in order to stop an unknown religious fanatic from instigating a Class <em>3</em> apocalypse, rationalizing the death of 6 billion people with the survival of 2 billion.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>:<ul><li> 6.

The X Door's hexadecimal value has a digital root of 6, which is the number of passwords needed to open it. This is also the total number of people eventually killed in Zero's story about the snail. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eric's mother, both of Akane's parents, a taxi driver, a top surgeon, and Sean.</span></li><li> Most of the game implies the Arc Number is 9, but near the end of the game, you find out the Arc Number this time around is 10. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because there are 10 participants this time around, not 9.</span> The most obvious use is that there is no Nonary Game this time around.

In previous games, the puzzles would always end with the exit door to the room being opened and the players immediately leaving. In this game, once the "YOU FOUND IT!" victory screen appears, it's very rarely done with the exit door opening. In most cases, a new contraption appears that leads to a Decision. In the case of the Transporter Room, the door leading out isn't even locked, with the focus instead being on the operation of the Transporter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>:<ul><li> Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">ludicrously violent injuries</a> featured in the game are biologically questionable.

If you do, however, Eric says "That's clearly impossible!" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since Eric is referring to a different Q than the player is.</span></li><li> In First Come First Saved-Q, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can clearly see a shadow of a fourth person in certain angles.

That's where Delta is sitting.</span></li><li> In one route, Eric bends down to ask Gab a question. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except the angle is too high. Eric is actually asking Delta, hence why he uses the term "old man".</span></li><li> In several timelines, C and D team will muse about how horrible it is that Q is dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Multiple characters lament over the realization that Q probably didn't know what was going on, due to his handicaps ("he couldn't see or hear").

For example, in the ending you get for shooting Mira in "Triangle", Mira audibly shoots <em>twice</em>- once for Sean and once for Delta. The only exception is when Eric kills Sean with a grenade, which could have easily killed Delta as well.</span></li><li> In "Coincide", Eric audibly calls out that Q is suspicious, and in general really distrusts him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is because Sean isn't on the X-Pass board at all, which suddenly gives a lot more justification to Eric being suspicious of Sean.</span></li><li> The X-Passes relate to each character's past or identity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> So why are Q's passwords completely different and don't match him at all?

All of this led to Brother having to deal with the grief of losing his friend, and set up the events of both <em>VLR</em> and this game.

For starters, even knowing about Delta at all requires you to play through at least one other timeline, and even once you know that he even exists, there's absolutely nothing to indicate that it would even be possible to kill him other than a vague error message if you try to enter "Q". Even <em>then</em>, most players would likely try to enter "Sean" and get a generic error, which would lead them to conclude that the original error was a mistranslation or something and thus drop that line of thought entirely.

Behind one door will be a prize, behind the others are nothing. The player selects a door, then the host will pick one more door, then discard the other door(s) The discarded doors cannot have the prize behind them, so it's either the door the player initially picked, or the door the host has selected. While logically, one might think that the odds are now 50/50 between the doors, statistically, you are more likely to get the prize if you switch to the other door.</span>. You are given 10 doors, one of which has a gas mask that you need to not be killed by the poisonous gas filtering into the room. After the Monty Hall problem is explained in game, you go through it. Now a savvy videogame player (or one who paid attention to the explanation given moments earlier) might think that success is guaranteed if you choose the "right" option. However, like the Russian roulette game elsewhere in the game, the location of the mask is is truly random, and it is possible to pick the statistically more probable answer and still get an empty locker, leading to the group's death. After all, the Monty Hall problem only increases your chance of getting the prize, not guarantees it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a>: Free the Soul, introduced in the previous game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The current Zero is their leader, Brother, and he has constructed the shelter as a SHIFTer training ground to stop a terrorist threat that will end the world.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brother's true motivations, as revealed in this game, throw his entire characterization in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em> into question.
