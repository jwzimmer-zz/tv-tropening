It is the second game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa">Danganronpa</a></em> franchise following the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganronpaZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganronpaZero">Danganronpa Zero</a></em> books.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Much like its predecessor, the game begins with a new student starting their first day at Hope's Peak Academy, an elite private school that only accepts the best of the best <em>of the best</em>, no matter how eclectic their field. Hajime Hinata, the new guy, has always admired the school and is eagerly looking forward to attending... that is, until he arrives at the school for his first day and suddenly falls unconscious.</p><p>When he wakes up, Hajime finds himself trapped in a classroom with fifteen other new "Ultimate" students. They are greeted by a strange rabbit-like doll called "Usami", who promptly announces that they'll be going on a field trip. With a wave of her wand, the walls to the classroom fall apart to reveal that they have all been stranded on the tropical resort island of Jabberwock. Under Usami's instructions, the students <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">must bond with each other</a> to gain the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Hope Fragments</a>" needed to leave the island.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>All of this is sadly for naught when Monokuma suddenly shows up and violently usurps control of the island from Usami. He then reinstates the same "School Life of Mutual Killing" rules from the first game, meaning that the only way off the island is for one of the students to commit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime">perfect murder</a> and sacrifice the other students so that they alone can leave. While the flow of the game remains largely unchanged, the dynamics of certain mini-games have been drastically changed and new ones have been added to the mix as well: for example, some segments of Non-Stop Debate task you with finding the right statement to <em>agree</em> with, and other classmates can now interrupt <em>you</em> with an objection, leading to a Rebuttal Showdown where you literally cut through their arguments until you finish them with a "Truth Blade".</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>After completing the game, an alternate story called <em>Island Mode</em> is unlocked where Usami strikes first against Monokuma when he appears and manages to beat him as a result, preventing him from taking over. The field trip goes exactly as planned, giving you plenty of time to bond with your fellow classmates in peace.</p><p>A localized version was released on September 2nd, 2014 for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita">Play Station Vita</a>. This version was later ported to PC via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> in April 2016. It was also released worldwide bundled with the first game as <em>Danganronpa 1&#12539;2 Reload</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> in 2017.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This game provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceOfEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceOfEvidence">Absence of Evidence</a>:<ul><li> Used to corner the first culprit. Teruteru claims to have been in the dining room with the others, but made no mention of Mikan tripping. This being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Teruteru</a>, the fact that he can't recall it is very suspicious indeed, combined with the fact that his voice was heard during the blackout...</li><li> Also used in the fourth trial. The murderer dropped a hammer at the crime scene to make it appear to be the murder weapon, but the fact that it doesn't have any oil on it proves that the murder weapon must have been something else.</li><li> Used in a somewhat roundabout way in the fifth trial, as well, where the cause of death is suspiciously absent from the Monokuma File. An element absent from the Monokuma File was pivotal to the last two cases, so Hajime realizes the case must be more complicated than it first appears &mdash; and indeed, it is.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Mikan implies that she was beaten at home as well as at school, which is how she became the Ultimate Nurse in the first place.<ul><li> Kazuichi rather casually mentions his father beat him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for skipping a school field trip.</a> The way he says it implies that it happened a lot growing up.</li><li> Fuyuhiko's parents used to try to kill each other on a regular basis and he sometimes got caught in the crossfire.

This person is heavily implied to be Junko. Throughout the game it is also heavily indicated that Nagito has romantic feelings for Hajime. In fact, in one of his free time events, he seems to be about to tell Hajime he loves him, only to ultimately back out and cover it up by claiming he is in love with "the hope that sleeps inside" Hajime rather than Hajime himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">Amnesiac Dissonance</a>: Between the surviving students' current personalities and their previous identity as Ultimate Despair.

Whether this is platonic or romantic depends on your personal interpretation.<div class="indent"><strong>Fuyuhiko:</strong> I... I never wanted a tool! I just wanted you! Only you! [...] Wh-Why!? Why couldn&#146;t you understand!? We&#146;ve always been together, ever since we were kids! [...] Please, Peko! Don&#146;t go...! I need you! <em>Don&#146;t leave me!</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">Anti Poop-Socking</a>: Each trial has an interval where the player is prompted to save their game. This helps break up the experience as completing a trial plus the aftermath can take well over an hour or more.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>: To an even higher propensity than the first game. Almost <em>every single murder</em> has a justifiable motive, or the villain otherwise has an understandable reason for committing the crime. Teruteru genuinely believed that Nagito was going to kill Byakuya and acted to save him, and only failed to admit it when he realized he could get out of this situation to see his ailing mother before she died. Peko only acted on Fuyuhiko's implicit orders to kill Mahiru for him, and positioned herself as a "tool for the blackened" rather than the blackened themselves in order to let Fuyuhiko escape the island. Unfortunately, Fuyuhiko <em>doesn't</em> view her as just a tool and Peko dies trying to protect him. Mikan is driven insane by the Despair Virus and regresses to her Ultimate Despair persona, and her sheer demeanor shift and brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> delivered to the class for failing to stop her being victimized makes it a hard pill to swallow. While Gundham plays up his villainy, it's heavily implied that he only killed Nekomaru to prevent the group from starving to death, makes very little resistance when he's accused of being the blackened, and it's also implied that <em>Nekomaru agreed to fight Gundham to the death</em>, making it one of the only murders in the entire series that has the consent of the victim.

This is commented on in Chapter 4 when Nagito discovers records of the first game's events.<ul><li> In Chapter 1, there is a failed murder attempt using a knife stolen from a kitchen, and the Ultimate Lucky Student is the first suspect. The culprit also tries to talk their way out of getting punished as they both believe their murders are justified. Both execution cutscenes also begin with the agitated culprit being dragged out of the courtroom by the throat. Furthermore, the first victim is someone important from the story's narrative (Sayaka is the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">deuteragonist</a> while the Ultimate Imposter is presented as Byakuya Togami from the first game). The culprits on the other hand were mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicReliefCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicReliefCharacters">comedic relief characters</a> who got unlucky (Leon was targeted by Sayaka and had to react, while Teruteru overheard that Nagito was going to attempt to kill someone).</li><li> In Chapter 2, the victim is bludgeoned to death with a single blow. There are hints that a serial killer is responsible but that turns out to be untrue. Plus, the Panic Talk Action (equivalent to the Bullet Time Battle of the first game) isn't against the murderer, but someone trying to defend them. More subtly, the first murder of the first game has a baseball player use a sword to attack the victim, while this case has a swordswoman use a baseball bat to attack. Also, the dark pasts of both the victim and the culprit have been revealed in the case.</li><li> In Chapter 3, there is a double murder, and the first body found is actually the second to be killed. This victim is also someone who was deeply affected by losing their newfound friend in the previous chapter. The game also hints that two people are responsible (like the first game) but in this case it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>. Also involves someone recovering their memories. It is also the only killing that was cold-blooded murder, with no sympathetic or noble elements to it (although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> puts a different light on Mikan's case).</li><li> In Chapter 4, it is initially unclear on whether it is suicide or murder. The victim is the largest and strongest person in the class. The final words of the perpetrator motivate the students to keep living. Also, the culprit notes that there was a possibility of them being killed by their target instead, which would have led to a <em>very</em> confusing case ... just like with Sayaka Maizono in the first game. Furthermore, both cases have been committed in an act of sacrifice.</li><li> In Chapter 5, the murder is staged with the goal of having a specific target (or in this case, targets) executed by the trial. The victim's death also involves the Spear of Gungnir, and the initially suspected cause of death is not what killed them. Also both chapters feature a cutscene with a bomb that blows a character across the room (but doesn't kill them).</li><li> Chapter 5 also has a lot of parallels with Chapter 4 from DR1. Both deaths were initially engineered by the victims, and someone who isn't the blackened tries (and fails) to make the students lose the game and have everyone executed. The victim has several wounds that would have killed them before everything happened if not for their massive willpower (and luck), and it also comes off as a twist that the cause of death is poisoning. And as a little extra detail, both (ab)Normal Days/Daily Life sequences feature someone getting slapped for tormenting the future victim.&#65279;</li></ul></li><li> "Or, in other words... that one of us is a serial killer? That sounds like a plot twist from some kind of weird game or something..." referencing Toko's split personality as Genocide Jack.</li><li> The password the students were looking for ended up being 11037.</li><li> Nagito's suicide - stabbing himself, tying himself up, poisoning himself, and spearing himself, all inside a locked room setup - mirrors most of the DR1 deaths: Sayaka was stabbed, Chihiro was tied up, Sakura was poisoned inside of a locked room, and Mukuro was speared; additionally, numerous stab wounds on his thighs bring to mind Genocide Jack's habit of carving marks upon her leg. Seeing how he knows how the murder victims died, as he tells Hajime in Chapter 4, this is likely very intentional on his part.</li><li> At the end of the game, Hajime appears to converse with Chiaki's spirit.

When they show their will to live deteriorating after the very first assignment, Gundham sets all the clocks in the Funhouse back 2 hours to 5:30 AM sharp while everyone is sleeping, making everyone believe that they still had more time to sleep (they were close to starvation and dehydration, so they wouldn't try to exert themselves). Because of this, the only one to go to the tower was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodCyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodCyborg">"Mechamaru"</a> who had a built-in clock tuned to the proper time.

However, Makoto is simply naturally idealistic. Hajime's version of Ultimate Hope is a designation handed to him by the Academy&mdash;he is <em>their</em> great hope due to being brainwashed and modified to have every possible talent. They fit this personality wise as well; while Hajime proves to be a good person, he is much more outspoken and sarcastic than Makoto and is not afraid of confronting and arguing with the other students when he needs to.</li><li> Nagito vs. Makoto: They are both Ultimate Lucky Students voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegumiOgata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegumiOgata">Megumi Ogata</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrycePapenbrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrycePapenbrook">Bryce Papenbrook</a> in the English dub). Makoto does have a certain level of luck, but it's subtle and mostly annoying or inconvenient for him. Nagito, meanwhile, has incredible good <em>and</em> bad luck&mdash;his life is a series of horrible incidents such as his parents dying or his plane crashing, but his luck will "cancel it out" and deliver him some kind of miraculous windfall afterward like winning the lottery as soon as his plane crashes or being accepted into Hope's Peak Academy right after being diagnosed with a deadly brain disease. Needless to say, the stress of this has warped his personality. Makoto also seems fairly comfortable with his supposed lack of talent, while Nagito has a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> that ruins his self-esteem and causes him to both idolize the other Ultimate students and treat normal people like garbage. As for both characters' relationship with hope, Makoto's version is for the most part played as a positive, while Nagito's version of hope drives him to cause despair so a "better hope" will rise above it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>: The executions, of course. Monokuma is once again at the top of his game.<ul><li> Monomi (first time): Poured full of bullets by the Monobeasts. Luckily, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">she has reserves</a>.</li><li> Teruteru Hanamura: Blasted with batter and flour, then dropped into a volcano.</li><li> Peko Pekoyama: Overrun by an army of Monokuma robots, tricked into severely wounding her master Fuyuhiko, and finally impaled.</li><li> Mikan Tsumiki: Strapped to a rocket in the shape of a human arm, which is injected with steroids - she is blasted off to space.</li><li> Gundham Tanaka: Trampled by a stampede as his minions watch helplessly.</li><li> Chiaki Nanami and Monomi (second time): Placed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a> firing squad which destroys all of Monomi's remaining bodies - when Chiaki attempts to flee with the last Monomi, she is chased by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a> robot into a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a> machine, where both are crushed.</li><li> Also, Nagito's 'suicide' definitely counts. He ties himself down with rope, stabs himself multiple times in the thighs and slices his own arm open with a knife, jams the knife into his right hand, and tricks the remaining students into throwing a fire grenade filled with deadly poison at him. When he inhales the poison, he dies and drops a giant spear into his gut.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a>: The Ultimate Despair group worships the original Ultimate Despair, Junko Enoshima, going so far as to carve up her dead body and surgically replace their own body parts with hers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">Cute and Psycho</a>: Mikan. Good lord, Mikan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDeferredConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDeferredConversation">Deadly Deferred Conversation</a>: Byakuya talks about "things" in his past he can't tell anyone about, yet defers the question when Hajime asks him to elaborate, saying only that he can (and indeed may <em>have to</em>) explain later. Unfortunately for interested players, <em>Danganronpa</em> is a murder mystery series, and Byakuya ends up being the first victim.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">Death by Irony</a>: Not to as great an extent as the first game, but some of the executions still count. See the Fridge Brilliance page for details.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a>: Discussed and ultimately subverted in regards to the dead students. Fuyuhiko suggests that, since all the events went down in a VR simulator, the death of their classmates will not affect them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> &mdash; however, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>, those students who felt they were dying have become braindead.

The OVA <em>Super Danganronpa 2.5: Nagito Komaeda and the World Destroyer</em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3TheEndOfHopesPeakHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3TheEndOfHopesPeakHighSchool">Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School</a></em> anime reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the students finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">awoke</a>, despite Junko's prediction.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality">Death of Personality</a>: A few big examples in the story. The Ultimate Despairs are placed inside a machine in an attempt to 'rewind' their personalities back two years before they became completely obsessed with death and despair. Meanwhile, Junko as the Monokuma virus attempted to hijack the program and upload herself into the comatose bodies of the murder victims. Finally, there's poor Hajime Hinata, who had his mind essentially surgically altered and replaced with the personality of Izuru, a sociopathic genius who was Junko's right hand. How effective the death of personality is by the end is left uncertain, since the game does not definitively state how much of the original personalities vs how much of the killing island trip personalities have been restored. All that can be said definitively is that Hajime seems to retain his Killing Trip personality and some (all of?) Izuru's memories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">Debate and Switch</a>: The outcome of the second case initially seems to hinge on the dilemma as to whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a> is a legitimate justification/defence or not: Peko killed Mahiru, but after being voted as the culprit, she claims that she only did it because Fuyuhiko ordered her, and he should be counted as the culprit instead of her, as she's just his "tool". This would effectively make Fuyuhiko the winner of the killing game, so he would be allowed to escape while the rest of the group would die. The others argue that, regardless of the circumstances of her actions, she's a person, not a tool, so she's responsible and therefore the correct culprit. However, it then turns out that she was not, in fact, acting under orders in the first place, effectively rendering the moral dilemma moot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet">Deconstructor Fleet</a>: The <em>entire game</em> seems designed to play the similarities with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a> only to ultimately subvert them. The entire ending calls many things stated about the academy and hope itself into question.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a>: The setting is far more outlandish than that of the previous game, exchanging the sealed-off Academy for an entire series of tropical islands guarded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> and including amusement parks and military bases with guns and rocket launchers just lying around everywhere. The executions are even more over-the-top, and one character is even turned into a robot at one point. It all makes more sense, though, once you figure out that everything is a VR simulation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesertedIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesertedIsland">Deserted Island</a>: The Jabberwock Islands. Subverted in that the islands aren't entirely devoid of civilization - there's a hotel and other buildings built there. However, other than the students, there are no other people around. This is mostly because of what it turns out they actually are.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">Designated Girl Fight</a>: With the exception of the fifth trial, all victims have same-sex culprits. Subverted with Akane and Nekomaru, who would fight each other regularly. Double subverted with Fuyuhiko, who was about to take out Mahiru until Peko did it herself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>: All of the survivors experience this in the climax of the 6th Trial, with having to choose between returning to their former Despair Crazy selves and risk being killed by Future Foundation (and Hajime basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality">being erased</a>), or retaining their memories but releasing AI Junko into the world to restart the tragedy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivesFollowFootprints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivesFollowFootprints">Detectives Follow Footprints</a>: Invoked by Peko, attempting to make Hiyoko leave a trail of footprints implicating her in the second murder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawingStraws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawingStraws">Drawing Straws</a>: Nagito suggests this as a way to determine who gets to clean up the lodge. He ends up with the short straw. Of course, this later turns out to be part of his murder scheme.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>: Subverted with the Chapter 5 murder victim (Nagito Komaeda). He sets up the crime scene and self-inflicts most of his wounds in order to make it <em>look</em> like this is the case. But he only died when he inhaled the poison that he had earlier put in one of the fire grenades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">that the other characters used to put out the fire at the crime scene</a>. Thus, the incident was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a> on Nagito's part to make one of the others unknowingly kill him. To most people this would still count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a>, but Monokuma has a vested interest in interpreting every death possible as murder and therefore punishable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">Dub-Induced Plot Hole</a>: The English localization is noticeably sloppier than that of the first game due to being rushed for release, with more than a handful of line breaks that make things difficult to read and typos. For the most part this doesn't affect understanding of the game with the exception of one present item: the memory notebook from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganronpaZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganronpaZero">Danganronpa Zero</a></em>. The notebook belongs to a character named "Ryouko Otonashi", but the localization mis-renders the smudged-out text as "Ky...ko...Oto...", running the risk of anyone unfamiliar with the novel to mistake it for Kyoko from the first game.<ul><li> The message at the end of Twilight Syndrome (in Japanese, "<em>Gokai shita</em>") is actually a hint to a cheat code that can be entered at the title screen. "<em>Gokai shita</em>" can be translated both as "You misunderstood" or as "Five times down". Hajime mistakenly falls for the former interpretation at first, only for Chiaki to point out the alternate meaning. There's no simple way to make this pun work in English, so only the latter translation appears, with Hajime needing a hint simply because he doesn't know what "five down" is supposed to mean. Luckily this didn't break any real puzzles, since in both languages Chiaki simply gives you the answer immediately anyway.</li><li> Sonia's comment about not being a virgin may be this, as the words for "young girl" and "virgin" sound almost the same when spoken aloud, and she may have misunderstood (perhaps because she's a foreigner) and thought Gundham was saying she was a young girl. But given a similar scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>, probably not.</li><li> It's stated at one point that one of Junko's followers had sex with her corpse, hoping to have her child. If that makes no sense to you (a pregnant corpse?), just know that the Japanese version actually states that a follower had Junko's uterus transplanted into her own body so that any children she bore would be Junko's.</li><li> The English localization can't seem to decide what language the characters are using. There are several moments where the fact that text is written in Japanese is explicitly mentioned, implying that it is out of the ordinary and the students aren't otherwise speaking/reading Japanese. In other instances, however, only Sonia as the resident foreigner is able to easily read English words, leading to a strange situation where the characters seem to be speaking neither the language of the original source material or the language of the dub.</li><li> In the first class trial, a major point is made of Byakuya's reasoning behind saying a particular line during the blackout. The actual translation of the line is more along the lines of "What are you doing?", implying that he could see someone in the dark (which he indeed could). The official translation went with "What the hell? This is...", which doesn't actually indicate that he could see anything.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E - H&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog">Eat the Dog</a>: After the group gets locked in the funhouse in chapter 4, Kazuichi briefly contemplates having to eat Gundham's hamsters.

However, the game adds a bit more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> by <em>customizing</em> the cross marks of certain students. Teruteru's cross is a knife and fork; Mikan's cross is made up of bandages and rotated so it looks more like a first aid symbol; Peko's cross is a shinai and sheath; Ibuki's cross is two drumstricks; Gundham's cross is a capital letter "X"; and Nagito's cross is dripping blood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a>: Monokuma claims the students killed in his game were reduced to this.

The world she's referring to is the post-Tragedy world of chaos and despair they brought about as members of the Ultimate Despair.</li><li> In Chapter 4, Monokuma claims there are "ship parts" hidden in the amusement park.

The Japanese Limited Edition includes a Monocoin replica, a small medal of the Hope's Peak Academy logo, Monokuma and Monomi keychains, and a plush of Monokuma's head.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> At the very start of the game, the scene fades out from Hajime being awoken by Nagito to a command line interface that ends with the words "GAME START". This is soon followed by Hajime's text glitching and him standing before a classroom door within an empty void. This doesn't come back into play again until the last trial, when it's revealed that the entire school trip was in fact a virtual reality.</li><li> In the hidden scene in Chapter 1 of the girls cooking, Chiaki invited Monomi despite most of the students disliking her, and feeds her some of the desserts she made in the same scene, hinting at their connection. She's also the one who gets Monomi to keep Monokuma from entering the old lodge during the party.</li><li> After the culprit of Chapter 1 is executed and before Monokuma uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> to go back on his promise to restore everyone's memories, Monomi acknowledges that everyone has indeed had their memories taken away from them, and she also implies that restoring their memories would be <em>really bad</em>.</li><li> On Peko's report card, her "like" is listed as the color black, hinting at her secret attraction to Fuyuhiko.</li><li> Early on, Monokuma announces that there is a "traitor" in the group of sixteen students. In many official images, such as the soundtrack album or even the image at the top of this page, Chiaki Nanami is either drawn separately from the main group or in a markedly different way (such as being upside down). She's the one who doesn't belong in the group.<ul><li> This becomes particularly evident at the start of the fifth trial, when the students' portraits are shown. They're divided into three pictures, and they're blue if alive and red if dead; at that point, Chiaki is the only blue one in her picture.</li></ul></li><li> Additionally, some of the decorated backgrounds behind the characters in the game's intro tell of later events. For example, Gundham's background is that of glowing "magic circles", and during his execution he tries to save himself by drawing magic protection circles on the ground.</li><li> On the topic of Gundham, his first Free Time event has him ask Hajime his "True Name". While it is a question asked due to Gundham's eccentric behavior, it seems more ominous given the reveal of Izuru Kamukura.</li><li> Another case happens with "The Wizard of Monomi", which was used as a basis for a "copycat murder" in Chapter 3. There were three deaths in the movie but only two murders in that chapter, because the most people a culprit can murder is two. The third unused death was "Tin Monomi being broken down into a heap of scraps." Guess what happens to Mechamaru the next chapter. For added irony, the person who points this out is the one who kills him.</li><li> During chapter 5 before one of the breakfasts, if you talk to Chiaki she will say that she had dreamed about a game involving Monokuma blocks that she couldn't win. Guess what happens to her after Class Trial.</li><li> The interface indulges even more in retro 8-bit aesthetics than the previous game, which hints at the events of the story being a <em>literal</em> game inside of a computer program. The prologue has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousVisualGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousVisualGlitch">Ominous Visual Glitches</a> which return at the end of Chapter 5, and the title sequence is that of a retro computer program startup sequence. This helped by the music suddenly turning into a chiptune version of the final investigation theme in Chapter 6 as the simulation continues to break down.</li><li> Red and black were the two colors Nintendo's [first] VR headset, the Nintendo Virtual Boy, rendered graphics in. Those two colors so happen to be the palette of choice for the pre-execution animations, which hints at VR being involved to whoever canny enough to make the connection.</li><li> Besides having gained a few pounds, Byakuya is a completely different person compared to the first game. Where in the first game he watched everything play out with an almost perverted sense of glee, here he immediately proclaims he won't let anybody become a victim. On the side, when it comes to gift-giving he now loves the junk food he previously rejected and hates one of his favorite presents from the previous game (Kopi Luwak/"civet coffee"). Come chapter 5 and it all makes sense.</li><li> While exploring the library at the beginning of Chapter 2, Peko is visibly unsettled by Sonia's admiration of serial killers. Her later claim to be one of them, a self-righteous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, turns out to be false.</li><li> Monokuma also often directly makes references to them being in a virtual world pretty often typically in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> while being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>. Most obvious cases are insisting on addressing things with game terminology and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a> he makes when telling them about how the Despair Disease spreads. To clarify: He tells you they are caused by invisible bugs. Upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that everyone is an avatar and all their real bodies are in pods that make physical infections impossible, it's obvious he is talking about <em>computer</em> bugs that are causing these symptoms by messing with the avatar's data directly, causing massive behavioral shifts and unlocking previously inaccessible memories in the case of Mikan through the glitches they are causing.</li><li> When protecting Akane from <em>a bazooka blast</em>, Nekomaru manages to hang on long enough to be turned into a robot. Why wasn't he blown into pieces? Because he's in a game!</li><li> During chapter 4, Nagito intentionally makes a game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a> more difficult for himself by loading up five bullets instead of one. This is similar to his "assisted" suicide in chapter 5, where he crafts a murder that is impossible to solve, meaning the culprit&mdash;one student out of six&mdash;must be picked randomly.</li><li> Mikan's unhinged, creepy behavior once she's exposed as the murderer in Chapter 3 makes a lot more sense once you reach the final trial and learn that the whole group were the Despair Remnants, and that the "beloved" she was referring to was actually Junko.</li><li> Up until his execution, Teruteru repeatedly says that everything happening isn't real. He may be fully in denial, but as it turns out, he's actually right- they're in a virtual world.</li><li> A subtle hint at Nagito being his own killer (even if it was through other person's hands) is given since the very beginning of the trial. Victims get rather similar-looking crosses over their portraits while perpetrators get distinctly customized ones (a first aid symbol for Mikan, a fork and a knife for Teruteru, etc.), and Nagito's cross is dripping blood.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a>: Mikan is naked when she screams orgasmically during her execution.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a>: The initial ending to the <em>Twilight Syndrome</em> game (at least until the secret code at the end is entered at the title screen to unlock the second part, which explains a lot more).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>: While walking around Grape House in Chapter 4, you can randomly be teleported above the map. You can't move or fast travel, the only way out is to reload a save. At least it doesn't spoil the secret of the Funhouse on you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>: When everyone is trapped in the Funhouse in Chapter 4 and starvation takes its toll on Hajime, the movement speed is slower than usual.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>:<ul><li> During chapter 4, everyone is locked inside of a funhouse with no food. You can still do free time events, even Akane's, who mentions having lots of food available during some of her events. You can also hand out food items as presents after spending time with someone, which they can even <em>reject</em> if they don't happen to like the gift, starvation be damned. But no matter how many bags of chips and cookies you are carrying with you, everyone will keep on complaining about hunger.</li><li> A gigantic case of this crops up when doing free time events in Island Mode, as lampshaded in the tutorial. In Fuyuhiko's very first event, which was originally scheduled for comparatively late in the game, there's references to his attempted suicide and Peko's death, and you can discuss this while you're on a tropical Monokuma-free idyll in which Fuyuhiko is still in one piece and Peko is very much alive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualEnsemble">Gender-Equal Ensemble</a>: Much like before, and now we even have a female mascot character to balance out Monokuma with Usami/Monomi.

Junko Enoshima mentions how he doesn't look like he's aged a day because of the program recognizing him as a high school student (with the same presumably going for his two partners). Ignoring the question of why a program designed for a specific group of people would even have high school data on him while out of his uniform, the better answer is that the designers probably didn't want to draw new sprites for the returning characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a>: The subject of a monologue/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">Hannibal Lecture</a> at the start of Chapter 2, where Nagito claims that unless somebody's <em>born</em> with incredible talent, they can never earn it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">Hate Plague</a>: A non-supernatural version of this is essentially the end result of the Ultimate Despair's ideology. It began when the reserve students were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> by Junko Enoshima and revolted against Hope's Peak Academy over their shabby treatment compared to the "main course" students.

In order to beat AI Junko, the final five survivors all activate the Neo World Program shutdown sequence, which would also delete the memories they'd created up to that point (and in Hajime's case, his entire existence) and cause them to turn back into Ultimate Despair. However, the epilogue heavily implies that they made it out with their memories intact.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>: Hope's Peak Academy itself &mdash; there were hints at this in the first game, but the sequel spells it out. It exists to foster an obsessive level of elitism, splitting the world into "the super-talented" and "the rest," a philosophy that wouldn't sit well with many people. However, the actions detailed in this game make it clear that it accidentally engineered its own destruction.<ul><li> The academy only cares about talent. If you possess enough of it, even if it is a bizarre or very subjective or very similar to a talent they already have, you're in. No matter how unstable, unethical or criminal you might be, and even if your talent could be harmful to yourself or to others, you'll be accepted and thrown in with your more peaceable peers without any supervision. So when one of them (Junko) turns out to be a nihilistic sociopath, she has access to a pool of hyper-talented people she can bend to her cause &mdash; including her Ultimate Soldier sibling and a nigh-unstoppable Academy experiment.<ul><li> Several of these talented people were also unstable in a way that let them be easily taken advantage of. Mikan had a very abusive and neglectful background, Nagito had a degenerative disease messing with his brain functions, Gundham seemed to be seeking attention by being overly dramatic. Some of them additionally would have still been easy to manipulate due to obliviousness like Sonia and Akane, though the former at least partially comes from culture shock.</li></ul></li><li> Any dubious (or downright criminal) activity they might commit was covered up by the Academy for the sake of reputation, up to and including mass murder. As a result, Izuru is left running loose, and Junko uses the cover up for her own ends. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> confirms the Academy also covered up Fuyuhiko's murder of Sato.</li><li> They used the Reserve Course to bankroll their super-special students (and the research the academy was doing on them). These reserves were only for use as cash cows for the Academy and received none of the special treatment the Ultimates did &mdash; and they were made fully aware of their second class status. Unsurprisingly, when the Reserves saw that the Academy treated them like dirt, only to use their money to create a mass-murderer, they revolted just as Junko wanted them to, which allowed her to further manipulate them later.</li><li> The Academy used (at least) one of those "mundane" students as a guinea pig by exploiting his admiration for Hope's Peak, effectively killing the good-natured original student and replacing him with what they saw as "The Ultimate Hope". They inadvertently created the killer who will be a major factor in the Academy's downfall - and even after he kills multiple people, they still insist he is "The Ultimate Hope".</li><li> In general, the Academy didn't supervise or rein in its students, and encouraged the idea that they weren't answerable to "average" people. The lack of supervision ensured that nobody even realized that Junko was a threat or that she was manipulating other students to bend to her will, and both the games and side materials indicate that having free access to the Academy's expensive and specialized facilities was <em>extremely</em> useful to Ultimate Despair (for example, the mind-wiping device &mdash; apparently nobody on the staff thought it might be a <em>bit</em> risky to have such a thing lying around).<ul><li> Even after the event had gone on to the entire world and was causing endless havoc, the Headmaster still didn't know that Junko and Mukuro were part of Ultimate Despair because the lack of supervision left him with no idea who actually was and who wasn't Ultimate Despair. If they'd actually tried to get the murderers in the school arrested, instead of covering up every murder that ever happened, this situation likely could have been averted.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeIsScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeIsScary">Hope Is Scary</a>: Arguably the entire point of the game, for how interrelated hope and despair are as concepts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>: When the Junko AI causes everyone to come close to crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> in the Chapter 6 trial, the next Nonstop Debate section glitches out: the screen darkens, Hajime's health bars begin to fluctuate wildly, controls become unresponsive (the evidence bullet can't be fired, no matter how hard you try), and Hajime's health bottoms out once the dialogue finishes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a>: A rather cruel one appears in the fifth chapter.

In the first game's fifth chapter, a character actually manages to survive Monokuma's execution by a last-second interruption. So when Chiaki notices an exit door in her execution chamber and runs off with one of the last Monomi spares, you're briefly led to believe that they might make it out after all.

However, the setting is <em>grounded in reality</em> and there is nothing stopping the mastermind from breaking said rules, besides the risk of "defeat by disqualification" in the eyes of those watching the game. In fact, the mastermind <em>does</em> cheat the game and break the rules in an attempt to kill off their most dangerous threat. In the second <em>Danganronpa</em> game, the mastermind's objectives are killing as much of the cast as possible, and luring their enemy into an extremely dangerous trap. In other words, the mastermind isn't <em>playing a game</em> here. However, since the setting is within a <em>virtual reality</em> (referred to as an <em>actual game</em>), and because the mastermind exists as an "NPC" within the virtual reality, they are physically forced to abide by the rules that already exist (though they can still add new ones). Because the mastermind can't kill the cast directly, they have to work around the rules and construct a <em>fake</em> killing game and either tempt or force (via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>) the cast members to kill each other.

To their credit, some of the students decide that Nagito is definitely too dangerous to be left to his own devices and tie him up at the start of chapter 2... But after Monomi frees him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifismBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifismBackfire">in a misguided attempt at teaching forgiveness</a>, the others just kind of forget about how much of a threat he is, despite him making it clear that his offer to cooperate with anyone planning to kill him still stands. Nagito is thus left to meddle with the following cases as much as he wants (which he surprisingly doesn't do much, but the others couldn't predict that). It takes until chapter 5 for them to attempt tying him up again, at which point it's too late to stop him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Kill It with Fire</a>: As the culmination of the various appalled reactions to the disturbing-looking memorial to Mahiru, Nekomaru proposes they burn it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a>: Monokuma reveals early on that all of the cast have had their memories stolen by the Future Foundation.

Monokuma could have just called it a simulation, but he <em>specifies</em> that it's a game, and the dialogue afterwards creates intentional parallels between the game they're in and the game you're playing.

Between uploading their avatars into the system and, therefore, Junko herself into the system; or returning their consciousness to their Ultimate Despair forms before being transported to the Neo World Program, Hajime is encouraged by an apparition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">Chiaki</a>, who encourages the rest of the game's cast, to choose the latter choice as it will result in something less likely of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ApocalypseHow/Class2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ApocalypseHow/Class2">Class 2</a> edition of the Tragedy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>: The game starts out looking like this. Its first opening animation is very upbeat, almost dating sims like, and the colors of the characters and the environment are notably much brighter than its predecessor. And then Monokuma comes into the picture. In the end, the game arguably still qualifies. Compared to the original, the game keeps a much more optimistic attitude in regards to a lot of things and ends on a much more overtly hopeful note.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightsOffSomebodyDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightsOffSomebodyDies">Lights Off, Somebody Dies</a>: During the party in Chapter 1, there's a blackout.

This would mean that he gets to go free while everyone else is executed, as the votes have already been cast. Monokuma says he is willing to accept this argument, but only if Fuyuhiko is willing to admit that he does not care about Peko. It doesn't work: Fuyuhiko says he never saw her as a tool and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">confesses he's actually in love with her</a>, so she is considered to be the blackened. Which is exactly what Monokuma expected to happen, since he then basically admits he never planned on letting the "tool" excuse slide in the first place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">and only pretended to go along with the idea</a> since he knew Fuyuhiko's confession would only cause both him and Peko to feel more despair before her execution.</li><li> In Chapter 5, Hajime demands that Monokuma stop Nagito from blowing up the islands by pointing out that it breaks the rule about an individual not being allowed to kill more than two people. Monokuma refuses, saying that since Nagito hasn't broken the rule <em>yet</em>, he isn't deserving of punishment until then. Of course, he possibly only said that because he knew Nagito's bomb threat was a bluff and in no danger of killing anyone.</li><li> The whole killing game is only possible because of this, something Junko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades explicitly at the final trial</a>. Once Monokuma took on the authority of "teacher," he was forced to find loopholes in the school trip's unbreakable rules in order to create a killing game without <em>also</em> violating said rules. Because Usami was a highly-developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">AI</a>, the rules bound her (and later Monokuma) as much as the students to prevent her from going rogue or acting outside the bounds of her programming. Monokuma was subsequently caught by rules meant to ensure the students' safety: not only may he not harm any students directly (unless they break a rule), he also can't allow any innocent students to die. In order to get around this, Monokuma made the "student activity" the Mutual Killing Game, both so the students began killing each other (and each murderer would need punishment, as being discovered as the blackened would be breaking the first rule, hence it fitting the "execution" formula with little effort) <em>and</em> to avoid being forced to intervene to save the students &mdash; the teacher is explicitly forbidden from meddling with the student activity, <em>regardless of what the student activity is</em>. The fourth motive, making "see how long the students can last without food or water until a killing game starts" the student activity, also matches this loophole and the "No more than 2 victims per killer" is following the "no <em>excessive</em> violence" aspect of the first rule in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">the eyes of Monokuma</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfInhibitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfInhibitions">Loss of Inhibitions</a>: The Despair Disease in Chapter 3, which changes people's personalities, is revealed to have inflicted this on Mikan as well as restore her memories from before the Killing Game.

But when Mikan gets it it restores her memories as a member of Ultimate Despair, specifically being cited as her getting a Remembering Disease. The only problem is that Mikan was never previously shown to be unusually forgetful.

Mahiru also falls victim to this as well, yelling and chastising Fuyuhiko for his role in Twilight Syndrome when she wanted to atone for her actions. Hiyoko also ends up drawing suspicion to herself in the early part of the trial by falsely claiming she didn't go to the beach house.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerDyesYourHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerDyesYourHair">Power Dyes Your Hair</a>: Along with Kiyotaka in the previous game (although less important to the plot), Hajime's hair turning white is a perfect example of this in the final chapter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>: Fuyuhiko succeeds in avenging his sister...at the cost of Peko and Mahiru's lives and the loss of his right eye.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>:<ul><li> Once the first trial is over and everyone has seen how insane Nagito is, Soda and Nekomaru decide to tie him and leave him restrained in a room where he won't be able to cause any more harm.

Both times that she does, everyone calls attention to how unlikely it is that she could land in such embarrassing positions.</li><li> When Monokuma releases the Despair Disease, Mikan's talents make her the most qualified to care of the infected. Unfortunately, being so close to them causes her contract to it as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>:<ul><li> The fake Byakuya Togami. He just turns out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">nameless</a> Ultimate Imposter, who has no real identity of his own. Monokuma explicitly states that the mystery didn't turn out to be important.</li><li> Nagito Komaeda &mdash; though perhaps unintentionally. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">He looks like</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantDoubleCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantDoubleCasting">has the same voice actor as</a> Makoto, and his name is (accidentally) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">Significant Anagram</a> which suggests that Nagito <em>is</em> Makoto. It's all just a coincidence.</li><li> The countdown timer.

A blackout indeed happens (with a subsequent murder), and it's later revealed that Peko left her post to go to the bathroom. It's implied that the killer had slipped her laxatives and/or tampered with the circuit breaker in the room. Both of these are false trails; Peko's stomach problems were just a coincidence, and the killer never touched the circuit breaker (although the circuit breaker <em>was</em> involved, but not in the way the characters believe.)</li><li> In Chapter 2, a significant chunk of the Daily Life is dedicated to talking about the mysterious serial killer Sparkling Justice and then Sparkling Justice's calling card is found at the murder scene, clearly trying to invoke the Genocide Jill reveal from the first game. This turns out to be a classic fakeout; none of the students have any connection to Sparkling Justice, and after Chapter 2 Sparkling Justice is never mentioned again and has no relevance to the plot whatsoever. Although, at the end of the second trial the killer (Peko) briefly <em>pretends</em> to be Sparkling Justice to throw the other students off the trail.</li><li> This can happen to overly paranoid players in Case 3. Fuyuhiko shares some very similar proportions with Ibuki, Akane explicitly states that the hospital gowns are unisex when she brings up the idea of taking Nagito's and you're unable to personally account for where he was when the murders supposedly took place. If accused, he'll threaten to cut his stomach open again to prove his innocence, and later on in the case he himself brings up the body proportions argument, which turns out to be perfectly meaningless and yet causes a slip of the tongue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">leads to the real killer</a>.</li><li> Also in Case 3, Monokuma's movie, despite Hajime seeing it during the investigation and suspecting the murderer was imitating it, turns out to have had nothing to do with the murder.</li><li> In chapter 4 there's mention of how some of the murders have been very similar to the events of the previous game, there's a statue of Sakura in the building and the person who died, Nekomaru, was a figure who cared about the others. From this and some of the oddities of his death the player can easily be led to think that his death was a mirror of Sakura's, where he killed himself to help the group. Though helping the group was <em>part</em> of the motivation behind it, it wasn't a suicide at all.</li><li> The Sonia/Kazuichi/Gundham relationship appears to be setting up to some kind of conflict, perhaps by creating conflict when one of the three is murdered. Instead, Gundham murders someone <em>else</em>.</li><li> At Sea King Industries, you find the construction site of the Monobeasts... as well as another station that seems to be building a human-looking android. This hints that one of the characters might actually be an android, but while there <em>is</em> an AI among the cast, the whole setting is a computer simulation so no androids are actually required.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringTwist">Red Herring Twist</a>: In Chapter 3 when Nagito, Akane and Ibuki all have the Despair Disease, Hajime and Fuyuhiko go check on Nagito and then start looking for Ibuki when she appear to be missing. Neither of them remember to check on Akane, but nothing comes of it, as Ibuki is the one who was murdered and Monokuma lifts the Despair Disease once a body is found. 8th</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a>: Like the first game, the protagonist can hang out with the other students and give them presents. This time, you'll be rewarded with Hope Shards which can be exchanged for skills during the trial sequences. Also, like the first game, there's a limited number of free time segments in each chapter, and you can't hang out with someone if they're dead. There are also certain characters who are unavailable at certain times for plot reasons.

There's a lot more of it in the final chapter; Hajime constantly complains about the implausibility of some of the more unrealistic features of the school, like the indoor cherry trees in the dojo, and thinks that keeping dead bodies in the schools bio lab is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">a ridiculous idea that should've been scrapped in development."</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>: Makoto notes in the epilogue that, while the game's events are over, The Tragedy isn't....

For Nagito's part, he <em>does</em> genuinely care about Hajime, albeit in a rather strange and scary way, culminating in what is often regarded as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedDeclarationOfLove">Aborted Declaration of Love</a>. Chiaki also fulfills a crucial role in assisting Hajime, providing emotional support when he needs it most, and he is absolutely destroyed when he has to condemn her to death.

The murder weapon is eventually determined to be a stolen swimsuit, stuffed with gravel from the broken aquarium near the body.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingElseAlsoRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingElseAlsoRises">Something Else Also Rises</a>: When Hajime wakes up in the hospital with Mikan in bed with him in bed, his ahoge is sticking straight up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingStoneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingStoneSword">Stepping-Stone Sword</a>: This is how Chapter 2's murderer managed to leave the scene of the crime without leaving any footprints behind - by using her shinai as a ladder to reach a window high up in the shower room.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryThatNeverWas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryThatNeverWas">The Story That Never Was</a>: Everything is all a computer simulation to retrain everyone to be better people. Well, at least that was the plan before Monokuma showed up and hijacked everything. A large part of the finale is about how to proceed with the situation, either undoing it all or letting the villain win. Despite all intents and plans, the reset turns out to <em>somehow</em> allow everyone to retain their memories and character developments, despite the timeline being thrown out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>: In Chapter 5, Nagito decides the best way to flush out the traitor is to start blowing up <em>everything</em>, threatening to destroy all of the islands unless they expose themselves. It turns out to be a bluff.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence">Stunned Silence</a>: Kazuichi is reduced to this after the "materials for a boat" Monokuma promised turned out to be for a <em>toy</em> boat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGullible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGullible">Super Gullible</a>: Near the middle of the third chapter, Ibuki Mioda catches a disease which Monokuma released on the island with random, personality-affecting symptoms. Among the three who contracted the disease, she was unlucky enough to get 'gullibility' as her symptom, which made it easy for Tsumiki &mdash; who was the nurse that was supposed to be caring for the sick &mdash; to strangle her to death; Ibuki quite literally went along with her own murder without suspecting a thing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a>: It's eventually revealed that the students are nothing more than pawns for the AI Junko to play with in order to lure out the real "main characters", aka the survivors from the first game. Once she finally makes her appearance, she continuously makes it clear that Hajime and co are nothing more than supporting roles in the big picture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspectIsHatless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspectIsHatless">Suspect Is Hatless</a>: After reading about Genocide Jack, Sonia warns Hajime to beware of middle and high school girls in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorFuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorFuku">Sailor Fuku</a>. As you might expect, several characters across the franchise fit the description.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>: Chiaki's speech to Hajime in the final chapter essentially boils down to this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a>: The mysterious voice who talks to Nagito in the mind-screwy "Chapter 0" believes that the world is like this, with talentless people hunting down those with talents and driving the world into an evolutionary dead end. It's revealed near the end that the voice belongs to Izuru Kamukura.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims">Ten Little Murder Victims</a>: Monokuma invokes this by announcing early on that there is a "traitor" in the group of sixteen students. Subverted on multiple levels: Yes, there is a mole. No, she is <em>not</em> a murderer but instead is a "mole" working for the good guys to observe and support the students. And no, the knowledge and suspicion of a "mole" does <em>not</em> lead anyone to commit murder: Nagito uses this excuse as a bluff to try and kill everyone <em>but</em> the mole.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>: According to Monokuma, there's a "student" on the island who isn't supposed to be there. Subverted in that the "traitor" is not the students' enemy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction">This Is a Work of Fiction</a>: Inverted in-series with the game <em>Twilight Syndrome</em>, which comes with a disclaimer that the events depicted are factual and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is entirely deliberate. It's later is indeed this, with the evidence being enough for Fuyuhiko to order a murder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinyTyrannicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinyTyrannicalGirl">Tiny Tyrannical Girl</a>: Hiyoko is one of the shortest, youngest-looking members of the cast and she's also a foul-mouthed, cruel bully.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a>: One of this game's defining endgame plot twists is that the person who set up the killing game by installing Junko/Monokuma into the program was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Hajime himself</a>, or rather, his personality after being genetically modified to be an Ultimate with every possible talent, Izuru Kamakura.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a>: Hajime, Fuyuhiko, Kazuichi, Akane, and Sonia already went through more than enough before trial six thanks to Nagito tricking Chiaki into killing him and learning about her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> but after the reveals about their situation and who they are starts up it seems like one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> moment after another. On top of losing their friends, they find out that they're Ultimate Despair, how monstrous they've become, they killed their friends, family, and parents; and the kicker...they are told that everything they went through will be erased. They will revert back to their despair selves, and their friends will possibly stay "dead" forever. Should they choose graduate, then they run the risk of letting AI Junko possess their friends (and eventually themselves) and finish destroying the world. Poor kids can't catch a break.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryCoverUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryCoverUp">Treachery Cover Up</a>: Hope's Peak attempted to cover up Izuru's murdering the student council because of his involvement in the Ultimate Hope Project. When Ultimate Despair revealed this to the world, <em>all hell broke loose</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword">Trust Password</a>: Used by Hajime during the final chapter to prove that Makoto, who joined the class trial to persuade the survivors to graduate, wasn't the real deal. The false Makoto, controlled by Monokuma, could not remember why the real one chose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">11037</a> as the password to the ruins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsToATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsToATeam">Two Girls to a Team</a>: By the end of the game, only Akane and Sonia are left alive of the girls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool">Two-Teacher School</a>: Though the game doesn't take place at school anymore, there's still only two "faculty" members around; Monokuma and Monomi. And both of these are robotic stuffed toys whose interest in educational pursuits is questionable at best. At least Monomi isn't trying to get the students to murder each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">Unusually Uninteresting Sight</a>: Hajime is <em>very</em> slow to pick up on all the bizarre glitching going on during and just before the final chapter, including several of his classmates apparently coming back from the dead. Likewise, even the classmates who are still alive seem to act like nothing's wrong.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBasedFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBasedFranchise">Villain-Based Franchise</a>: Monokuma's back, and ready for more despair!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">Villain Has a Point</a>:<ul><li> Though he's not an out-and-out "villain", in Chapter 4, Gundham shoots back after being berated for being the culprit:<div class="indent"> If one would call murder so that one may live "evil", then what must one call surrendering on life itself?!

When you look back at how the group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">never call Hiyoko out</a> on her merciless bullying of Mikan or reassure her when she called herself "worthless", she's not exactly wrong.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginSacrifice">Virgin Sacrifice</a>: Sonia asks Gundham to take her along next time he goes to the amusement park of Hell.

Hajime goes out after a day of rest, on the last day on the countdown, and encounters Chiaki - who died in the last trial. Then the other dead students start appearing, although they're never displayed in-world. The survivors witness the last message left by Nagito, who gives them the password to the ruins on the second island - 11037. Then they actually get to the ruins, and everything glitches out of whack.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in Chapter 1, when Teruteru <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping">suddenly drops his laid back composure and starts speaking in a country accent</a> after being accused of being the killer.</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Teruteru</strong>: "I told ya to wait a sec, ain't IIIIII!?"</div><ul><li> As Mikan is finally found out in the Chapter 3 trial and starts to really lose it, she drops a line that reveals that the events of this game aren't so disconnected from the rest of the franchise as one might have thought...</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Mikan:</strong> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!

As he declares that the victim was actually strangled, the player is treated to a narrative shot of the anonymous killer wringing the unconscious victim's neck with a smile on their face.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>: An odd, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example found in the Dojo. If you examine the targets, Hajime notes that they could have had a minigame here if the production team had more time.

Interestingly, she doesn't scold Gundham for the same thing when Gundham does it to her earlier.<ul><li> The group react like this towards Hajime when he and Nagito conclude that Mikan killed Hiyoko and Ibuki, finding it unlikely she'd have it in her.</li><li> Mahiru does this twice to Fuyuhiko - once in the first trial when he threatens to sell Mikan to a whorehouse when she says Byakuya could not have been killed with a knife, and again when she calls him out on murdering Sato. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">The second time it costs Mahiru her life.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBuxom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBuxom">World of Buxom</a>: The female cast members (except for Mahiru and Hiyoko) are drawn this way in the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://comic.mag-garden.co.jp/beats/2737.html">Super High-school Level Good Luck and Hope and Despair<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> spinoff manga.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>: Despite the students being trapped in a massive computer simulation, the program works <em>too</em> well, meaning that anybody who dies inside it effectively becomes braindead in the real world.

Given that all the source material we know on the subject comes from her own mouth, and Sonia herself is known for having an intense fascination/admiration of serial killers in general. Not helped by the fact that the only known publication on the island pertaining to Sparkling Justice was seemingly in Spanish, which presumably only Sonia was able to read and translate for the others. The only person we know of that Sparkling Justice killed was the journalist who they murdered after their interview. And Sonia was apparently easily able to accept that Mahiru could have been murdered by Sparkling Justice for the crime of being an accessory via not revealing a killers identity to the police. It may simply be that the people Sparkling Justice executes are "criminals" by their own view only, and not necessarily have committed any real crimes.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
