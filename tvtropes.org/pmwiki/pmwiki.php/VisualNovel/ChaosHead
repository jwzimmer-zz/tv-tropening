He is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a>, having crafted a "minimum attendance shift chart" to ensure that he can attend school as little as possible while still graduating.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>When the story begins, he is only known to have even semi-regular interactions with a few people: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">bratty younger sister Nanami</a>, his ESO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandOfBrothers">guild partner Grim</a> (whom he speaks to online), the school's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">resident playboy Misumi</a>, and Seira, whom he has become deluded into thinking exists, to the point that he can hear her talking and interact with her as a kind of muse. Beyond these, he seems to be quite afraid of interacting with people, exhibiting classic signs of social phobia (such as extreme discomfort with making eye contact).</p><p>This routine life is shattered when, upon coming home one day, he hears the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">sound of something being pounded into concrete</a>. Looking over, he sees a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlWithPsychoWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlWithPsychoWeapon">pink-haired 'demon girl'</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">pinning a body to an alley wall with cross-shaped stakes</a>. The girl turns, smiles, and inexplicably calls him by name, at which point he runs. This scene is the third in a series of bizarre, gruesome murders called the "New Generation" murders. Takumi initially wants nothing to do with this, but a mysterious user known as 'Shogun' begins stalking Takumi, and seems intent on dragging him into the whole mess. Takumi then realizes that this mysterious man is working with the demon girl. Meanwhile, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Noah OrganiZation Of Medical Instruments, or the NOZOMI Group</a>, puppeteers the New Gen incidents for their hidden, sinister purposes.

The player is given a choice between a good delusion (happy, humorous, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi">H</a> in nature) or a bad delusion (paranoid, violent or tragic in nature). For example, when Nanami visits and berates Takumi for not ever calling home, she takes a swig of soda without asking; the good delusion brings up the concept of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndirectKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndirectKiss">Indirect Kiss</a>, prompting Takumi to compare it to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eroge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eroge">hentai game</a> scene (at which point it almost does turn into one), and the bad delusion involves Nanami taking a swig of coke, then gagging and coughing up blood and dying. Takumi wonders why that happened, then remembers that he poisoned the coke beforehand. Typically these delusions have no direct influence on the story itself (Takumi simply snaps out of it and the scene continues from where it left off), but seeing certain ones triggers flags that can influence which ending you see. Many of these delusions involve blatant reference to anime (or eroge) tropes, as well as surprisingly clever foreshadowing.</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeOfTheGame">game was made into an anime</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse">Madhouse</a> for the fall 2008 season, with an Xbox 360 updated rerelease titled <em>Chaos;Head NoAH</em> released in February 2009.</p><p>A fan translation patch for the game exists, but was taken down from the main site due to an agreement with Nitroplus, which unfortunately led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> as there's no localized version of the game yet, in fact no news after the "agreement" between the original fan translators and Nitroplus were given.</p><p>That being said, a current fan translation by Committee of Zero, a group dedicated to translating Science Adventure content that never came to the west, is currently working on translating the <em>Chaos;Head NoAH</em> version of the game as it is the canon entry that future titles rely on story wise.</p><p>The game is the predecessor to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/RoboticsNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/RoboticsNotes">Robotics;Notes</a></em>.</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">Sequel</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosChild">Chaos;Child</a></em>, was released for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> in 2014, with different cast of characters in the same setting of Shibuya set several years after the events of <em>Chaos;Head</em>.

In the end it's revealed she was privy to what was going on the whole time, but was trying to keep Takumi out of danger.</span></li><li> Much of what Ayase says sounds like cryptic, denpa babble, talking about a Wicked-Hearted King Gladioul who wants to destroy the world and Seven Black Knights that are needed to defeat him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But in reality, she was talking about a prophecy she'd read in The Gladioul Saga which was referring to Noah II and the seven Gigalomaniacs that are currently in Shibuya</span>.</li><li> Takumi has a memory from when he was 10 years old of one time where he forced to stay home from a field trip and was incredibly mad over this, venting out his anger in violent drawings. The next time, the kids who went on said field trip were injured and the teacher was killed in an accident. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is because Takumi accidentally real booted the events he drew in his drawings to happen in reality.</span></li><li> Takumi also has a memory of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Reality TV show where the hosts were getting a precognitive person to predict what was in some boxes without any knowledge of what was in them before hand, and Takumi accurately predicted 100% of the contents. This was because he real booted the contents to be in those boxes.</span></li><li> Gero Froggy is a toy mascot that is currently a cute hip fad in Shibuya. One odd thing about this though is that most people seem to gather on Friday in massive droves to purchase them, almost unnaturally so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that Gero stands for "GE Rate Observer", and the mascots are being used to test how GE Rate affects the groupthink mentality of Shibuya's populace, which is why it mysteriously attracts people to buy it on the same day the GE rate spikes. Ban also puts two and two together to discover that the NOZOMI group is the one backing the company that makes Gero Froggies, which is more evidence that they're behind this conspiracy.</span></li><li> It's mentioned a few times that Gigalomaniacs are extremely rare, less than 1% of the population of the planet, yet seven of them are in Shibuya at the same time and all attend the same High School. <em>NoAH</em> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is because NOZOMI intentionally built the school and gathered them there to keep watch of them for this purpose, though Rimi and Yua being there were not of their own volition.</span></li><li> One of the few limitations of Gigalomaniacs is that they can not heal themselves due to their sense of pain preventing them from denying the reality that they are wounded. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takumi is able to get around this limitation because he's undergone so much pain that his nerve endings start becoming numb and he stops feeling it, which combined with embracing the fact that he's a human created by delusions, lets him to delude himself into thinking he isn't hurt and can heal himself.</span></li><li> Nearly every time we see a scene where Takumi isn't present, the people present in the scene usually note that they feel like they're being watched by someone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is because Shogun is watching them through his delusions, which subconsciously passes onto Takumi and gives him the knowledge of those events once he awakens as a Gigalomaniac and recalls those subconscious instances of spying on others thoughts.</span></li><li> Two delusion choices when Takumi goes into the hospital talk about how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takumi never left the hospital, that Yua is crazy and should be locked up in one as well</span> and that Takumi is wearing a light green hospital gown. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The real Nishijou Takumi never checked out of the hospital and remained there on life support, using his delusions to try and stop Nozomi. Takumi wearing a light green gown hints that he is also Shogun, because Shogun's text color font when he first makes contact with Takumi is light green.</span> NoAH also reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yua is suffering from D.I.D. and is actually Mia, which explains her bipolar behavior.</span></li><li> The first positive delusion choice you can choose in the game shows Takumi walking to an alleyway not of his own volition, and hearing an odd sound coming from around the corner, but he is stopped by a pink haired girl who tells him it's too dangerous to go there and calls him Taku. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is likely something that subconsciously came into his thoughts as a result of sharing a mental link with Shogun and his thoughts, as Shogun knows Rimi wants to stop Taku from seeing the crime scene at the alleyway to prevent being awakened and will go to great lengths to protect him, and also knows that Nozomi will drag him there later that day after committing the murder.</span></li><li> Yua seems oddly obssessed with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finding the New Gen killer</span>, to the point that her entire demeanor changes when it comes up, and she goes to insane lengths to try to achieve this goal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It makes much more sense once it's revealed her sister was an innocent victim of the murders and she believes the killer is heartless.</span></li><li> Sena knows more about Gigalomaniacs and what they can and can't do limitation wise, as well as the drawbacks to their powers than anyone else in the cast does. Takumi himself wonders multiple times where she studied this or found out all of this information. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When it's revealed that Sena's father was one of the top researchers for Project Noah, and that she was taken to Ark Heart Medical by NOZOMI workers for 3 months after being awakened as a Gigalomaniac to get her CODE sample taken, it's easy to surmise that she read the minds of the people who took her in after awakening and found out the information from them.</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G-L&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek">Geek</a>: Takumi, to an unhealthy extreme. He much prefers 2D girls to real women, and would rather not mingle with real people. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yua acts like one to get Takumi to trust her, though it's later revealed that her love for anime and manga is genuine.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekPhysiques" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekPhysiques">Geek Physiques</a>: Subverted.

Since her second child and Sena's little sister mana died shortly after birth, they created a new baby from artificial delusions and gave it to her. Sena's father was against turning her into a guinea pig, but also didn't want her to realize that her child had died, so he reluctantly approved. The experiment continued for several years, until it was decided that enough results were gathered from it and it will be halted. Sena (who didn't know about the experiment) unfortunately happened to be there when they turned the machines off, causing her mother to freak out upon realizing she's been carrying a corpse and proceeded to tear at her face, <em>eat her child's corpse</em>, and stab her own eyes out with a pair of scissors.
