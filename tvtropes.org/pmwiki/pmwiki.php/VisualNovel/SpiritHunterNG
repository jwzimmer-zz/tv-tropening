This is shown with Akira's Nokia mobile, a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillenniumBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillenniumBug">Y2K</a>, and gothic lolita fashion only just coming into style.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>:<ul><li> A few details about the characters and story can only be found in the character profiles unlocked throughout the game. Most notably, it goes into more detail about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Satomi and Yuri</a>, and how the former <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">came to meet and conceive a child with Yakumo</span>.</li><li> The Urashima Woman novella provides details about her past that aren't present in the story, along with providing a name for the midwife that killed her - Yasuko Kuramoto.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotif">Animal Motif</a>:<ul><li> The rabbit motif from <em>Death Mark</em> shows up in a few, subtle ways; the bathmat in Akira's apartment has a bunny design, his aunt's bar is called The Black Rabbit, and Kakuya, despite her fox-like appearance, is an explicit reference to <em>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</em>, which is loosely connected to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonRabbit">Moon Rabbit</a> myth.</li><li> Turtles are featured prominently in the Urashima case, inhabiting the lake that the Urashima Woman haunts. It's later revealed that the Urashima Woman's murderer dumped dead fetuses in the lake, which possessed the turtles and caused their shells to bear human faces. In one Bad End, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaoru</span> is found dead with turtles spewing out of their mouth. This is a nod to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urashima_Tar<!--C5-->8D">Urashima Taro<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the hero of the folklore that the Urashima Woman is based on, who was rewarded for saving a turtle's life.</li><li> Dogs are front and centre for the Kubitarou case, as they are the primary victim of her decapitations. Maruhashi's devotion and loyalty to Seiji are compared to that of a bulldog, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which foreshadows him becoming one of Kubitarou's victims, later found wearing a dog mask and collar</span>.</li><li> Birds are prominent throughout the Screaming Author case. The silhouette first seen outside the house resembles a crane, the titular screaming sounds like a bird warbling, and evidence around the house relates to a performance of "Lac des cane", or "Duck Lake". A young girl was slated to play the part of a princess becoming a duck, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which Yakumo made a literal reality, kidnapping and mutilating her into a bird-shaped monstrosity.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>: In one of the Screaming Author Bad Ends, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ban's</span> arm is severed off when the Screaming Author drags them away with razor wire, reflecting how the Author itself had its limbs removed when it was alive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>:<ul><li> One of the Screaming Author's victims was the very man who brutalized their body and killed them. As their other victim was unintended, it makes it easier to feel pity for them and their horrible circumstances.</li><li> The Killer Peach's victims were all part of a club that was embezzling money out of their company, and one of them was a peeping tom with photos taken non-consensually of his female co-workers. Moreover, when she discovered that their president <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was responsible for covering up a department store fire, they brutally murdered her and hid the body.</span> Suffice to say, Akira has no sympathy for what they went through at her hands.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyDollBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyDollBaby">Baby-Doll Baby</a>: Kubitarou's severe mental disorders caused her to mistake a teddy bear for a younger brother that she didn't have. When the bear's head fell off, she started decapitating others in the hopes of offering them to a sacred cedar so that he could be "revived'. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Putting a head back on the bear and offering it to Kubitarou is necessary to pacify/destroy her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoonRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoonRising">Bad Moon Rising</a>: The Demon Tsukuyomi is rumoured to only appear when it's summoned during a full moon.

In the resulting Crisis Choice, the way to succeed is to honestly answer Ooe's questions, but also make it clear that Akira isn't intimidated by the police or the prospect of being held by them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: Kakuya is the fox-like doll spirit who kidnaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Akira Kijima</a>'s cousin Ami to force Akira to play her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a>, where he must appease various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengefulGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengefulGhost">vengeful ghosts</a> for her entertainment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout">Big Blackout</a>: In the Killer Peach case, Ban bribes a Moon Tower employee with three million yen to cut the power to the entirety of Moon Tower, allowing him and the rest of the cast to sneak in and investigate the spirit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarrchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarrchitecture">Bizarrchitecture</a>:<ul><li> The Miroku Mansion has a secret passageway that somehow deposits a person back at the mansion's entrance. Ros&eacute; theorizes that going through the passageway leads to a Miroku Mansion that's in a different state than the previous one.</li><li> Stepping out into the 44th floor of the Moon Tower does not lead to an office like Akira and co. expected, but instead a ruined, time-displaced department store. This turns out to be the work of Tsukuyomi, which activated the time loop when it was turned into a spirit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">Bloodier and Gorier</a>: While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DeathMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DeathMark">Death Mark</a></em> was no slouch when it came to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>, NG really turns up the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">gore</a> and blood. The Kubitarou case has on-screen decapitations, to name just one example, and children and animals aren't safe from death either.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSplatteredWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSplatteredWarrior">Blood-Splattered Warrior</a>: When facing Demon Tsukuyomi, Akira rushes forward and attacks it with a katana, spraying its blackened blood all over him. Since he has the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychometry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychometry">psychometry</a> which is activated when he touches blood, this actually provides him an important clue to Tsukuyomi's involvement with Kakuya.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHorror">Bloody Horror</a>: Blood plays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">much more prominent role</a> in this game compared to its predecessor. Most of the deaths are shown in their full, gory detail. The main character can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychometry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychometry">psychometry</a> by touching bloodstains, and each spirit leaves a blood pool behind that he can use his ability on to gather clues.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABloodyMess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABloodyMess">A Bloody Mess</a>: At the mini shrine in Kintoki, Akira spots something that looks like red intestines splayed over the offering plate. It turns out to be red bean paste from a squashed manju.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Bolt of Divine Retribution</a>: A bolt of spiritual intervention strikes down on the protagonists after the Kubitarou case. It sets a tree alight and causes it to fall over, hitting Seiji and Kaoru on its way down.

After that point, the chapter's spirit continues to harass him through his own mobile and home phones.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairytaleMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairytaleMotifs">Fairytale Motifs</a>: Many of the spirits contain references to Japanese folklore. D-Man suspects that this is deliberate on Kakuya's part, making them like fairytales while she's hosting them.<ul><li> Kakuya is an obvious one to Princess Kaguya from <em>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</em>. Her riddle references the tale, with the solution being to "cut" the letters "bam" and "boo" out of the listed phrase.</li><li> The Urashima Woman's case is inspired by the story of Urashima Tarou, and contains multiple references to it. The island's lake that the ghost inhabits is called Ryuuguu, which is the same as the palace from Taro's story. On the island is Tamate hall, a play on Tamatabako, which was also in Urashima Taro's tale. Finally, the lake is infested with turtles, which references how Taro saved one in the tale.</li><li> Kubitarou of Kintoki is inspired by the legendary folk hero Kintaro, who was, in turn, said to be inspired by the real-life warrior Sakata <em>Kintoki</em>. Kintaro was known as an incredibly strong child who carried a hatchet to protect his animal friends; Kubitarou, conversely, uses its incredible strength and axe to decapitate animals and collect their heads.</li><li> One of the central characters of the Screaming Author case is a children's fairytale novelist, so naturally, the chapter is rich in references to them. The three most prominent are Swan Lake, Momotaro/The Melon Princess, and Tsuru no Ongaeshi.<ul><li> A modified ballet of "Swan Lake", known as "Duck Lake", was to be performed by the victim of the case, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was kidnapped and horribly mutilated to resemble a bird (like how the princess in the story becomes a swan).</span></li><li> Akira receives a dog, pheasant, and monkey mask, the three creatures that join Momotaro in his journey. He has to place the masks in the order that they joined Momotaro in order to proceed to the mansion's attic. Ban and Ros&eacute;'s constant sniping is also reminiscent of the rivalry between the dog and monkey. When off to confront the spirit, Akira's mark recites a version of the melon princess' "Tonkarari" poem.</li><li> It's revealed before the final confrontation with the Screaming Author that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yakumo wanted to transform her into a crane so that she would repay the favour back to him</span>. This is revealed in a document he titled "Tubasa no Ongaeshi", a play on "Tsuru no Ongaeshi" using the victim's name.</li></ul></li><li> Momotaro returns in a greater way for the Killer Peach case. The spirit's face looks different to those who see it - either a dog, pheasant, or monkey, the three animals from Momotaro's tale. This is why she earned the name Killer Peach, as Momotaro is the "Peach Boy". Later it's shown that her child drew her like Momotaro, so she took upon his aesthetic when fighting against injustice, and also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">said child was named Momotaro, which is why he made the connection</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeRelationship">Fake Relationship</a>:<ul><li> To distract the guard at the Urashima Lake, Seiji and Kaoru pretend to be lovers in the middle of an argument. To Seiji's surprise, and the player's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">amusement</a>, Kaoru ad-libs that she's pregnant and goes off on a rant against the hapless guard.</li><li> To lure out a spirit that supposedly only attacks couples, Kaoru brings along Akira and pretends that they're together.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyBusiness">Family Business</a>: The Black Rabbit was left to Natsumi by her late husband, and is popular with its limited customer base for its cozy, easygoing atmosphere.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>:<ul><li> The Killer Peach case features a CG of a woman in a lacy black bra, which is disturbing for multiple reasons; there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyMouths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyMouths">mouths all over her body</a>, she's barely alive, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's the protagonist's aunt</span>.</li><li> Would you like to see a CG of a naked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Ros&eacute;</a>? How about a shirtless Ban with his hair down? The Demon Tsukuyomi case has them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if you destroyed Killer Peach previously, leading her to seek revenge against your companions - Ros&eacute; is found naked with a katana gored through her stomach, while Ban is literally split in two.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightClubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightClubbing">Fight Clubbing</a>: In middle school, Akira's friend Seiji used his Yakuza connections to set Akira up in an underground fighting ring. His winning streak was unbroken and he was one of the most popular fighters as a result. He calls it quits just prior to the events of the story, which Seiji reluctantly abides by. In Seiji's ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akira decides to get back into it, recognizing that he can't return to a mundane life.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringInTheAirALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringInTheAirALot">Firing in the Air a Lot</a>: Seiji's firearm sees use in the confrontation with Kubitarou when he shoots it into the air multiple times to catch her attention.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">Flat "What"</a>: Akira's reaction when Kaoru asks him, seemingly out of the blue, to take his clothes off. She wanted to ink a protective incantation on him but didn't bother explaining that beforehand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHorror">Folk Horror</a>: Many of the spirits are inspired by Japanese folklore, and murder their victims in ways that reference the old tales. Of particular note is the Screaming Author case, where the titular author deals in children's horror folklore, and as such, the chapter is littered with homages and references to Japanese folk tales.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> Maruhashi's devotion to Seiji is compared to that between a dog and its owner. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is in the chapter where dogs are being decapitated by Kubitarou, a fate that Maruhashi shares just before Akira confronts Kubitarou.</span></li><li> Masaru accuses Yakumo of not being sexually active anymore, with Yakumo refuting him. This is said over a CG of Yakumo holding a Kakuya doll <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the exact same way as Akira holds it, who later turns out to be his son.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyChill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyChill">Ghostly Chill</a>: The story is set in the middle of summer, but Akira notes that an unusually cold wind stirs up during his meetings with the mysterious Kakuya spirit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostStory">Ghost Story</a>: As with its predecessor, each chapter has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">infodump</a> near the beginning where a character will divulge the tale of the chapter's spirit, told in the form of a rumour.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlySkirtTwirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlySkirtTwirl">Girly Skirt Twirl</a>: Upon finding a magical girl stick in a department store, Kaoru takes it up and starts twirling around in imitation of the character it belongs to. Doing so causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">her skirt to fly up</a>, and she threatens Akira with a curse if he ended up peeking (Akira being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Akira</a>, he didn't see and had no intention of peeking).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>: The best ending is achieved by making sure all of the spirits are pacified and all of the companion characters are kept alive. Kakuya is successfully sealed away, the companions go about their lives, and Akira has a cozy end with either Seiji or Kaoru and Ami.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNeedsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNeedsEvil">Good Needs Evil</a>: Seiji tries to justify the presence of the Yakuza as a necessary evil. Without criminals, the cops would be out of a job, so the current arrangement is mutually beneficial. He then goes on to ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem">who made the world so corrupt in the first place</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveMarkingScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveMarkingScene">Grave-Marking Scene</a>: At the start of the game, a memorial is set up for Yuri at the point where she was run over in the underpass. One of the game's first tasks is getting fresh flowers for the memorial, with it being said that Yuri's friends Kaoru and Ami visit the place frequently. More generally, the spirits of ghosts manifest in the place they died, thus the characters must visit those places often to pacify them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>: While going up the elevator to confront Killer Peach, Akira and his companion end up getting stuck in a small time loop. It works out in their favour, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as it prevents Ooe's deaths from sticking</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>: While <em>Death Mark</em> was generally thorough in explaining what item had to be used where to beat the boss, <em>NG</em> is a little laxer in its explanations, and it's entirely possible to face a boss without having all the items required to beat it. This is especially apparent in the Urashima Woman case; the way to beat her is to show her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a calligraphy contest poster</span> that proves her child is alive. The problem is that said item is easily missed (it spawns in the starting area that the player has already looked over multiple times already), the woman's name is only given once, so the familial connection can be easy to miss, and all the evidence up to that point seemed to indicate that the child died in stillbirth - but convincing the Woman of that leads to the Bad End where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaoru</span> dies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">Half the Man He Used to Be</a>: This fate befalls <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ban</span> if the Killer Peach is destroyed and seeks vengeance against Akira's companion - when Akira finds them a few days later, they've been split cleanly in half from skull to pelvis, each half of their body splayed out on the elevator floor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, the rules of Kakuya's Game are much more difficult for Akira than its previous victims - where they had to play mundane games with Kakuya, like marbles or hide-and-seek, Akira has to pacify vengeful ghosts that can kill him and his friends in a variety of gruesome ways. Ros&eacute; explains that Akira is basically stuck on Kakuya's "Nightmare Mode".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHeadquarters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHeadquarters">Haunted Headquarters</a>: As it turns out, Akira's apartment has a power to it that attracts spiritual beings, which is why they have a habit of leaving their haunting grounds and following Akira home. When Ros&eacute; suggests that he move out, Akira refuses since it's too much hassle, and he isn't afraid of the spirits anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse">Haunted House</a>: The Screaming Author spirit is found inside the Miroku mansion, an odd blend of Alpine-Japanese architecture where a children's author is said to live - though he hasn't been seen in a long time, and the house instead has become infamous for the strange screaming that permeates it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedTechnology">Haunted Technology</a>: The first victims of Kakuya's curse are run over and killed by driverless cars that she summons to the underpass. Surviving against one constitutes the first Survival Escape.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazardousWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazardousWater">Hazardous Water</a>: The Urashima Woman was drowned in Urashima Lake, and thus all of her victims suffer from drowning. When confronting her, Akira and his companion have to escape on a boat across the lake while fending her off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices">Hearing Voices</a>:<ul><li> As a portent of their imminent death, and reflective of the pregnancy theme of the chapter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaoru</span> hears the sound of a baby crying just before they're killed by the Urashima Woman in a Bad End.</li><li> The victims of the Screaming Author constantly hear screaming in their head after encountering the spirit for the first time, which eventually drives them insane and causes them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">commit suicide</a>. Akira starts to experience this after his first visit to the Miroku Mansion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a>: Akira's relationship with Kaoru, which features subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> and clear interest on Kaoru's end, is reflected in his equally important relationship with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> Seiji. Anything that Akira does with Kaoru, he can do with Seiji - go along on a pseudo-date, give them a ride on his bike, listen to them sing, or get a special ending with them. Kakuya is revealed to be madly in love with Akira, and is jealous of <em>both</em> Kaoru and Seiji for being closer to Akira than she is - in the Normal End, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she can possess either one of them in her attempt to violently romance Akira</span>. All that said, Seiji is more attracted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">Akira's aunt</a>, while Akira <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">doesn't show much interest in romance at all</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostessClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostessClub">Hostess Club</a>: If Seiji is saved during the Kubitarou case, then he'll invite Akira to a hostess club later to let off some steam. Not by interacting with the hostesses, of course, but by blackmailing a man out of his company secrets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanNotepad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanNotepad">Human Notepad</a>: Attempted by Kaoru, who tries to ink the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Sutra">Heart Sutra<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> onto Akira's body in order to protect him from his supernatural curse. Seiji walks in on them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">while Akira is undressing</a>, which makes him put a stop to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>: As revealed in the Demon Tsukuyomi case, the reason Yakumo was mutilating girls was to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turn them into dolls and offer them up to Kakuya, satisfying her need for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a> and keeping her sealed for a further ten years.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>: A running theme throughout the story is that much of the conflicts are caused by human cruelty: the spirits are all vengeful because they were horribly treated in life; their murderers got away with it because of the corrupt society they live in; and even Seiji, the heir to the Yakuza, bemoans the rotten state of the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour">Hypocritical Humour</a>: When Akira asks Ooe to keep him updated on the Momoi Department fire, she responds that she's not allowed to divulge investigation details to civilians. He immediately calls her out on how many rules she's already broken, and she cheerfully concedes the point.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">Impaled with Extreme Prejudice</a>: Happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ros&eacute;</span> in one of the Killer Peach Bad Ends - their body is posed such so that Akira and company can see the katana that's been stabbed right through their stomach and is protruding, blood and all, from their back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedLockpick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedLockpick">Improvised Lockpick</a>: In the Urashima Woman case, Akira and Seiji need to break into a shack to obtain some oars for a boat. Seiji asks Akira to find items that could substitute for a tension wrench and a metal wire; once he has them, Seiji is easily able to pick the cylinder lock.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyEscape">Indy Escape</a>: The first Survival Escape pits Akira and Ami against a possessed vehicle that drives down a narrow alleyway towards them. Akira gets Ami to safety by forcing her into a nearby storage unit, then leaps up and clings to the ceiling pipes as the car barely skims under him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteFlashlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteFlashlight">Infinite Flashlight</a>: Akira carries with him a flashlight that never runs out of battery, regardless of how many dark areas he uses it in. It's even noted in its description that it lasts for an unusually long amount of time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecuritySystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecuritySystem">Insecurity System</a>: The Sumii company proves to be rather lacking security-wise in the Killer Peach case. Ban is able to bribe a guard into killing the power for the building, half of the employees have computer passwords that are easily accessible, and the toughest piece of security, a biometric bypass, is thwarted by Ros&eacute; lifting some fingerprints off the boss' possessions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseSoundtrack">In-Universe Soundtrack</a>: Momo's popular song "Wander Rabbits" is heard in the background when Momo makes an appearance, but can also be heard in-universe as Akira's ringtone and playing in the local convenience store. Also, one of Akira's CDs apparently contains the game's jazz track, as revealed when he listens to it one evening.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a>: In the Kubitarou case, Kakuya forces Akira into making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> between his friends Kaoru and Seiji. At the end of the game, Kakuya repeats the question, this time asking Akira whether he prefers <em>her</em> to his friends.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNurseryTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNurseryTune">Ironic Nursery Tune</a>: Kubitarou of Kintoki goes around singing a children's song about the sacred cedar tree of Kintoki. Given that Kubitarou is an axe-murdering spirit with a horrible, groaning voice, the effect is rather chilling.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWontTurnOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWontTurnOff">It Won't Turn Off</a>: After visiting the Miroku Mansion, Akira is haunted by the Screaming Author. It keeps calling him via his mobile, and then via his home phone, the latter even after he's unplugged it. It's not until he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveShutdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveShutdown">smashes it to pieces</a> that he's finally relieved from the calling.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a>: The game features multiple, usually a ghost that will briefly appear just to spook the player.

Taking the call turns out to be important, however, as it provides them with an important clue on how to take Tsukuyomi down.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L-R&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a>: A sequence in the end-game has Kakuya wiping Akira's memories of Seiji and Kaoru, out of jealousy that he's closer to them than he is to Kakuya.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGraspAtLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGraspAtLife">Last Grasp at Life</a>:<ul><li> In the Game Overs where Akira is drowned by the Urashima Woman, the death CG has his arm desperately reaching for the surface as the last of his consciousness slips away.</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ban</span> dies in the Screaming Author Bad End, their hand can be seen reaching out to Akira as they're dragged away by the Author's razor wire.

Of course, the entire appeal of the game is unveiling the mystery behind the spirits and their mysterious deaths.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LearnedFromTheNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LearnedFromTheNews">Learned From the News</a>: Akira tries to keep the details of Ami's abduction a secret from her mother, as he worries that she'd become involved in the supernatural and be put in danger as a result.

While the rumour itself is serious (a spirit is supposedly killing couples with poison) and the ensuing investigation has a Crisis Choice, the whole thing is played like an awkward date between Akira and Kaoru, and is pretty funny as a result.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesClarkKentHatesSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesClarkKentHatesSuperman">Likes Clark Kent, Hates Superman</a>: Downplayed with Akira's apathy towards Momo Kuruse, Kaoru's idol persona.

This makes for a chilling scene when Akira is escaping her by boat and she can be seen in the water, her long neck <em>slowly</em> rising out of the water.</li><li> If <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ros&eacute;</span> dies in the Screaming Author case, then their neck is unnaturally elongated by razor wire to give them a grisly resemblance to a crane, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotif">motif</a> of the chapter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLopsidedArmOfTheLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLopsidedArmOfTheLaw">The Lopsided Arm of the Law</a>: The police are ignorant of any supernatural happenings and can't do anything to prevent the various grisly murders at the hands of spirits. However, they have much less issue finding evidence that Akira was at the scene of the crimes (<em>stopping</em> said spirits and saving lives), and promptly haul him into the station during the Killer Peach case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingYourHead">Losing Your Head</a>: In one of Kubitarou's Bad Ends, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaoru</span> is decapitated.

In the original Japanese, the word she used was in a dialect that Akira wasn't familiar with, thus he couldn't parse what she said. In the English version, he's never heard the word "famished" and mistakes it for a name, with Ban baffled that he could make such an error. It stands out as odd since otherwise, Akira doesn't have any problem with large words (and would possibly be familiar with "famished", given that he used to live in poverty and would skip meals often).</li><li> When meeting her for the first time, Ooe mistakes Momo Kuruse for Banana Kuruse.

The scene shifts to Natsumi's perspective, with her getting a single glimpse of the culprit before she falls into a coma. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's cute little Ami, her daughter, and the protagonist's cousin.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>: In the Bad End, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akira's Bloodmetry becomes so powerful that it starts to deteriorate his physical and mental health. A mysterious voice helps out by transforming into something inhumane - with the new form comes new powers, and the complete degradation of Akira's personality into something primal.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombHorror">Womb Horror</a>: The theme of the Urashima Woman, a spirit who appears in the form of a pregnant woman. It's revealed that she was killed after childbirth by her midwife and had her baby stolen; she roams the lake searching for her child, and kills those who can't tell her where he is (or those who throw rocks into the lake, as she interprets it as an attack on the dead fetuses that were dumped there). After she's pacified, it's implied that the midwife filled her swollen stomach with rocks to weigh her down when she was thrown into the lake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>: Akira's best friend, Seiji Amanome, is the heir to a Yakuza boss. The Amanome name is infamous throughout the city, and Seiji frequently uses his connections in the game to gather information, get rid of nuisances, or serve as protection for him and Akira. As a result of being so closely tied to the Yakuza, Seiji is a sadistic person who gets a thrill from threatening others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded">You Are Grounded</a>: At the end of the Kubitarou case, one of Akira's companions will be comatose. The other one will be temporarily grounded (Seiji by his father, Kaoru by her agency) to justify the inclusion of two new companion characters, though they do make a return in the Tsukuyomi case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourAnswerToEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourAnswerToEverything">Your Answer to Everything</a>: Akira is fond of using his physical prowess to solve his problems, something that Seiji calls out when they're up against a security guard and need to hide.<div class="indent"><strong>Seiji:</strong> So barbaric.
