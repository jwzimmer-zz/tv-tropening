</p><p>Not necessarily. In fact, not even probably. Potentially dangerous insanity in the ruling line rarely appears in a single, isolated case when it comes to fiction. Nope. Chances are the whole family line is just as affected somehow, which means that sooner or later&mdash;probably sooner&mdash;along will come Queen Enid II and King Dolf III both or either of whom is painfully, obviously off their rocker enough for people to openly comment... And, the whole thing will start up all over again.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This may continue for a good many decades or even centuries, with each new generation crossing its fingers that they get one of the "good" rulers from the line and not one of the "iffy" bunch. If you are unfortunate enough to get stuck with one of the blood-drenched loonies, one common solution is to go find someone else from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">same family</a> who didn't get hit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> stick and put <em>them</em> on the throne instead of poor Enid or Dolf before revolution breaks out. This is where disgraced half-brothers, exiled princes/princesses and unknown sons/daughters come into play. Unless something permanent is done about the family problem, however, this is most likely just a temporary solution. Give it a generation or three of this side-branch inheriting, and it'll be back to our regular Queen Enid "Tree-Whisperer (and Agricultural Reformer)" IV and King Dolf "<em>Bloody</em> Insane" VI programming.
</p><p>In fiction there are several common reasons why a royal family might be prone to madness.
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Genetics:</strong> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> in the completely literal, biological and strictly genetic sense. Often, that means excessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">Royal Inbreeding</a>, sometimes <em>very</em> excessive. The initial problem maybe wasn't inbreeding, but some genetic damage caused by an outside source that then becomes intensified and cemented into the royal line after the fact either through deliberate inbreeding or the sheer bad luck of not understanding biology when selecting mates. In any case, the family just has a crazy streak that's now inbuilt, and you're not getting rid of it unless your society is advanced enough to have genetic engineering (or a magical equivalent thereof) to deal with the problem. Or, becomes egalitarian enough for the high nobility to stop marrying each other so much. That last bit ought to help. Eventually.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Moral Lamarckism</a> is the classical, magical version. The moral failings of your forebears express themselves in a taint on your own soul or karmic bank balance, like a kind of spiritual gene. Functionally, there isn't much difference.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Family Curse</a>:</strong> Arguably, this is worse than a crappy genetic surprise. Someone, or something, has cursed the royal line... somehow and for whatever reason (most likely revenge). This can easily be a lot nastier to deal with than the problem of bad physical or moral genes, because even if you're careful about avoiding the inbreeding and taking care to select mates for brains, upstanding habits and/or governing skills, the curse really <em>doesn't</em> care. It may even spread out to people who marry into the royal line and cause them to go mad, even though they're only family by marriage, not by blood. It also means that you might not solve the problem by just picking a new family to rule over you&mdash;they're also likely to get swatted by the curse just as soon as they take power if the thing was either badly worded or specifically made to target those who rule a particular place, rather than just "the family of the one who wronged me". Obviously, to fix this you need to figure out who or what cursed the royal line with what words and why they did it, and then work out how to deal with the mess by whatever means necessary. You could try jumping straight to a parliamentary system to see how the curse deals with having hundreds of "rulers", but you'd better hope it just doesn't spread out to cover them all, or it will make your old problem seem <em>laughably</em> trivial by comparison.
<ul><li> One variant of this is a spiritual or moral imbalance brought on by upsetting the planetary or universal equilibrium or law in some way. This works just like a curse, but is the result of natural processes, rather than deliberate, magical malice. This lack of motive can make it harder to detect or uncover.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Cultural:</strong> The madness is the product of nurture, not nature; which means turning to exiled princes will be fine, at least for the first generation. If people don't change the culture that produced the madness, it will return, however. Possible reasons include:
<ul><li> The family has just become <em>too</em> used to being pampered and in power over generations, and each successive one has become a little more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">backstabby, corrupt, decadent and detached</a> from general, boring, common everyday reality until <em>finally</em> people start to notice the extent of what has become a huge problem.
</li><li> The culture actually <em>expects</em> its rulers to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural">"divinely touched"</a> and requires the king or high priest to be at least a little crazy, particularly in theocracies with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle">Mad Oracle</a> tradition or another culture with a particularly notable flavour of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings">Divine Right of Kings</a> idea behind them &mdash; say a line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Emperors</a> where rampant megalomania and other quirks are considered just part and parcel of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Royalty Superpower</a> package. Not being weird enough might even disqualify you, so you'd better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">learn to act the proper degree of nuts</a> at the very least. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Comes with risks attached</a>, however.
</li><li> The cut-throat culture itself is so hard on its rulers either politically or militarily that not being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">paranoid and vicious</a> means your reign will be measured in months... if you're lucky. In this case, you only look insane to cultures or classes outside your own; within your own palace and/or while on the inevitable battlefield, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">behaving as if everything is out to get you</a> is primarily a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp">survival strategy</a>, and <em>not</em> just a way to pass the resulting PTSD and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">Thousand-Yard Stare</a> around.
</li><li> The very way the royal kids are raised becomes severely detrimental to their sanity. Bring them up to specifically become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat">sheltered</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">entitled</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">morally myopic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">empathy-free</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brats</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Caligulas</a> are almost <em>inevitably</em> what you'll get once they get tapped on the shoulder by their inheritance. Unless they just become reclusive shut-ins who need helpers to do everything. Including sneeze. Be it by accident or design, the whole palace has not done anybody any favours.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Environmental:</strong> Some X-factor specific to the royal family's home location, diet, or environment is mucking things up.
<ul><li> Heavy metal poisoning, especially lead. (If you're looking for others to shake things up, antimony, mercury and arsenic are places to look: they've also had effects.) Seriously, it's a fashion at the moment for forensic archaeologists to imply this as the cause of most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">real world cases</a> of mad monarchs 1500-1815, the source primarily being lead makeup. There were a few reasons for this: lead makes for an easily applied and very white pigment... which aristocrats loved to whiten their skin with to emphasis how little outside work they had to undertake, as well as not to look sweaty or smell so bad (lead pigments also can act to some extent as deodorants). These same aristocrats stopped using makeup from about 1815-1920 for fashion and decency reasons (moral decency, that is); not coincidentally, the incidence of insanity among them dropped, although they weren't entirely clear on why at the time). Although lead in the booze and water (more from the lead used in distilling equipment and pipework than the relatively negligible amounts leached from the crystal glasses) has also been implicated.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0eiaj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0eiaj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0eiaj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">More recently, the higher crime rates in the West and particularly the US 1960-1990 have been attributed to lead poisoning, from leaded gasoline and lead paint. "Lead is bad news" holds for everyone, evidently.</span>
<ul><li> There's also a fact that for most of the Classical Antiquity and Middle Ages the lead acetate was known as "sugar of lead" and thought to be a great sweetener: it's cheap, easy to produce and much sweeter than the other alternatives. In was widely used in cider-, perry- and winemaking, and given that for much of the period the preference was for very sweet, syrupy concoctions, it exposed the drinkers to far worse doses of lead than any lead plumbing could.
</li><li> Until the trade with India really picked up at the height of the Roman Republic, and cane sugar started to be imported, about the only sweeteners known in the Europe were honey and must &#151; aka "boiled-up fruit juice or pressings" (see also <a class="urllink" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_cuit_(Suisse)">Swiss vin cuit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a direct, northern descendant similar to apple butter and <a class="urllink" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_cuit_(France)">French vin cuit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a direct southern descendant which is a concentrated wine). The juice of the sweet, ripe grapes famous around the Meditetranean is rich in glucose, and boiling the water off a lot concentrated the sugar; first into the syrupy<em> defrutum</em>, and then into the molasses-like <em>sapa</em>. Given the Romans penchant for lead utensils at every stage, one shouldn't be surprised that they widely used lead-soldered, lead-lined or just plain lead cauldrons to do so, which exposed a lot of lead to the acidic grape juice, leading to formation of the aforementioned lead acetate &#151; as well as lead malate, lead ascorbate and other lead salts that naturally went right into the syrup. In fact, the lead acetate probably got its common name, "sugar of lead", because someone tasted the whitish crystals that formed on the rim of their defrutum-making pot.
</li><li> In East Asian, and especially Chinese, history, the main culprit for royal/imperial madness was not lead but mercury. For complicated reasons, the Chinese alchemists in particular insisted that mercury and its ore, cinnabar, were not only harmless, but key ingredients in any health tonic or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElixirOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElixirOfLife">elixir of immortality</a>. Naturally, Chinese emperors were all about immortality, and so many an emperor was prescribed the elixirs. You read that right; Chinese emperors willingly ate or drank mercury <em>to achieve immortality</em>. What's more, the alchemists were so sure that mercury was the key to eternal life that they did this for centuries, if not millenia&mdash;emperors of practically every dynasty are recorded to have died from it, from the first emperor of Qin in the third century BCE to the Yongzheng Emperor of Qing, who died in <em>1735</em>. That's almost <em>2,000 years</em> of emperors poisoning themselves. To beome immortal. Yes, we can feel the irony.
</li></ul></li><li> Disease. Specifically, something like syphilis; it's an STD, so it would get passed around the court, it causes madness if untreated, and the first generally effective treatment wasn't discovered until the 20th century: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsphenamine">Salvarsan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This links back to the heavy-metal poisoning: the common treatment before Salvarsan was <em>mercury</em>, and while that sometimes worked it also ran the risk of driving the patient a different kind of mad through mercury poisoning. Fun fact: syphilis can (and has) inserted its DNA into the human genome, just for that extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> sparkle you might be looking for.

If combining with magic, expect... a Curse and see further up this list.

</li><li> Claudette has serious issues with her family due to the fact that she's an illegitimate daughter and so not allowed to officially inherit the family estates, despite being the most formidable fighter. She does love her sisters, but at the same time she hates them, and she also feels torn between love &amp; loyalty and hate for her father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In <em>Rebellion</em>, with a little magical coaxing from the Swamp Witch, her negative feelings turn her into a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>, thanks in part to Leina giving her the throne of Queen.</span>

Although Changeling culture is primarily based off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>, the royal family has a reputation of intermarriage amongst its members that, throughout generations has led to many physical and mental disabilities and illnesses much more similar to those of old European royalty. Queen Chrysalis appears to have dodged most of these ailments, but her daughter and heir, Crown Princess Pupa is both heavily mentally and physically disabled. Pupa, at the time of the fanfiction, is approximately the same age as the Cutie Mark Crusaders, yet she can neither walk or talk, and is treated as virtually an infant and carried around as one by her careers. She is comparable to King Charles II of Spain and Feodor I of Russia. As one commentator remarked, <em>"the Changeling royalty is essentially a tour of all the screwed up monarchies of Europe."</em>, again ironic as the culture is primarily Japanese.

Thanks to inbreeding and genetic damage caused by environmental factors, some of the Vorbarra rulers have been... problematic:
<ul><li> Mad Emperor Yuri killed off most of his own family and then got dismembered and scalped by his own nobles, led by his brother in law/cousin.
</li><li> Yuri's brother in law/cousin/successor Ezar was a relativly sane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a>, but was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">ruthlessly amoral</a> beyond belief.

</li><li> Ezar's son Serg was a twisted sadist who probably would have destroyed the Imperium if he'd been allowed to take the throne. Ezar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">killed him</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a> (too bad about the grunts).
</li><li> Serg's son Gregor inherited the throne at age five when Ezar died, and, remarkably, grew up sane and stable thanks mostly to his adoptive parents, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus">Aral Vorkosigan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">Cordelia Naismith Vorkosigan</a>. But Gregor became so paranoid about the genetic insanity in his family line that he refused to consider marrying anyone even <em>distantly</em> related to him.

<ul><li> Fortunately Barrayar has recently gotten a handle on genetic engineering, eased up on the social stratification, and annexed another planet with its own unrelated set of merchant nobility (one of whom Gregor eventually married), so that nasty strain of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus">nutjobbus maximus</a></em> is likely to be cleansed from the line in the future.

<ul><li> The main curse of madness/misfortune/sterility/whatever would make things most difficult in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion">The Curse of Chalion</a></em> is particularly nasty, in that it automatically spreads to anyone who marries into the family, making it completely impossible to eradicate without, as it turns out, <em>direct intervention from the gods</em>. The unlucky king Orico tried to short-circuit it by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting his wife, Sara, pregnant by his chancellor, because any child of theirs would not be part of the cursed royal bloodline</span>. It didn't work because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sara was barren and also the chancellor was evil and his brother was an evil whackjob</span>, but one gets the impression it was a clingy curse that would have come down on <em>whoever</em> inherited the throne, as well anyone around them who could potentially have finagled a way out. Thus, it took a miracle in the end.
</li><li> And then there's that strange familial wolf-madness thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHallowedHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHallowedHunt">The Hallowed Hunt</a></em>, too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Revealed not to be madness, but an ancient shamanistic tradition that creates powerful animal spirits linked to certain rulers; the protagonist's dad just had the bad luck to pick a sacrificial animal that was rabid and bit him before it died, and the poor protagonist wound up convinced his own wolf-spirit would do the same to him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Present in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>, in the form of the royal line of Cthol Murgos, the Urgas family, with its hereditary insanity. In sequel series <em>The Mallorean</em>, the eventual successor to the throne is more or less sane, which makes sense, given that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not actually the son of the crazy late king, but instead the product of a brief affair between one of the king's wives and a foreign diplomat.</span> That's one effective way to get the crazy genes out of the royal line.
<ul><li> Made even more effective by the traditional method of ensuring easy succession: whoever gets the throne has every other potential claimant assassinated. <em>Legally</em>. Maybe the Murgos have had problems like this before...
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> &mdash; the early Ottoman Empire tried to cut down on wars of succession by having all male relatives of a newly crowned sultan put to death. Predictably this only <em>increased</em> the number of succession wars, as every potential claimant to the throne knew that upon the death of the old sultan he had to either win the crown or die. Urgit's quote of "It was either the throne or the block." in <em>King of the Murgos</em> is drawn straight from history.
</li></ul></li><li> The various Tolnedran imperial dynasties tended towards this as well. Typically the first few emperors of a dynasty would be clever, competent men, but after several generations of inbreeding the line eventually devolved into rulers who were insane, imbeciles, or both. And then subverted by the Borunes, who by their contractual obligations have to marry Dryads. Introducing exogamy into the family line every generation must help. Of course, female members of the Borune family are Dryads also (and exclusively Dryads, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">there's no such thing as a female half-Dryad</a>)...

He committed an action so terrible that every single member of his family changed their names and refused to take up the sovereignty &mdash; although only people like Dame Ceinwen remember even that much of the story, and nobody remembers the specifics. Ever since, there have been Lords of Mochdreff rather than rulers styling themselves princes, until finally, due to the lack of a clear heir to the previous Lord, Prince Tryffin was appointed Royal Governor and took it upon himself to try to clean up the matter once and for all by getting to the bottom of the curse.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series, the Rahl family line, for several generations, have been warmongering psychopaths. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The protagonist</span> is, depending on the reader, either an exception or adhering to the rule.

This, coupled with the fact that the Egyptian gods are basically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so obsessed with ritual that they've become willingly comatose</span>, made the country weak and unstable enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">the Amazons</a> to take over.
</li><li> In P.C. Hodgell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath">Chronicles of the Kencyrath</a></em>, the house of Knorth, from which the ruling Highlords come, has what appears to be an inherited tendency toward madness. Torisen, the current Highlord, is terrified of what lurks in his bloodlines, and of becoming like his father and grandfather. Inbreeding and deliberate breeding for Shanir (magical) traits is probably responsible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>'s Marlfoxes. The mother Silth is a raving maniac, her youngest is a sneak who deliberately feeds her mother's paranoia in order to weasel (or fox?) her way into power, and the oldest six offspring are just plain nasty to various degrees.

Particular mention is made of Mad King Alain, who was truly a raving and unstable lunatic but did his people the favor of dying quickly &mdash; he decided to go outside and play games on the lawn during a raging thunderstorm (lunatic, remember?) and got struck by lightning.
</li><li> The Argaven kings of Karhide in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a></em> are described as congenitally mad. This seems to be accepted as part of the nature of kings on Gethen.
</li><li> The page quote comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, in which the royal Targaryen line is said to be blessed with greatness as much as it is cursed with madness, in part due to centuries of inbreeding to keep the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Blood of Old Valyria</a>" pure. It started with the first Targaryen king, who was a great man but unfortunately married and had children with both of his sisters (a family tradition); from there on out it's been a crapshoot. The line has produced many able warriors, statesmen, and scholars as well as a rogue's gallery of tyrants and psychopaths. Some Targaryens begin quite noble and lose their grip on sanity as they age, such as King Aerys II &mdash; by the end of his reign, he was known as King Aerys the Mad, and in the end his excesses sparked a revolt that toppled the dynasty. Daenerys, the only POV character with Targaryen blood (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">so far as we know</a>), seems more sound of mind than her relatives, but is a bit delusional and idealistic, and would do well to take the advice of those around her. The books give us only one normal Targaryen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(two if you count Jon Snow)</span> &mdash; Maester Aemon, as even the much liked Rhaegar was bipolar and had delusions of grandeur.
<ul><li> The Lannisters seem to be heading the inbred-madness route, too: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> King Joffrey and his siblings Myrcella and Tommen</span> are the product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Brother&#150;Sister Incest</a> between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Cersei (married to King Robert, whom she hates) and her twin brother Jaime.

Hopefully averted with Prince Tommen and Princess Myrcella, who are both perfectly sweet children... for now.
<ul><li> Well, the incest might be a factor (and, those who believe Stannis will no doubt jump on that explanation). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Joffrey</a> really didn't have a chance: his mother both spoiled and smothered him as well as refused to let anybody else educate him... while neglecting such things as mathematics, ethics, psychology, and <em>reading</em>. His father, although not exactly abusive, was both distant and neglectful. Anybody else who could have stepped in to discipline or direct him were either chased off (Maesters) or never spotted the problem until far too late (Grandfather, Father-by-blood and Uncle).
</li></ul></li><li> The Targaryen madness is, in truth, highly overrated.
</li></ul><div class="indent">&#149; Aegon I &mdash; Perfectly normal, <br>&#149; his son Aenys I &mdash; Fairly normal, if a bit indecisive, <br>&#149; his half-brother Maegor I &mdash; Psychopathic murderer, <br>&#149; his nephew Jaehaerys I &mdash; Best king Westeros ever had, <br>&#149; his grandson Viserys I &mdash; Aside from not clearing up his line of succession, quite normal, <br>&#149; his son Aegon II &mdash; Paranoid, but for good reason, however lustful and unpleasant <br>&#149; his nephew Aegon III &mdash; Depression, but stemming from watching his mother be devoured by a dragon rather than genetics, <br>&#149; his son Daeron I &mdash; Became king far too young but not actually crazy, <br>&#149; his brother Baelor I &mdash; Religious fanatic but nonetheless loved, <br>&#149; his uncle Viserys II &mdash; Kept his nephews from imploding the realm during their reigns, but died before he could finish the job as king himself <br>&#149; his son Aegon IV &mdash; Obese, corrupt, and horribly ineffectual, <br>&#149; his son Daeron II &mdash; Second best king Westeros ever had, <br>&#149; his son Aerys I &mdash; Obsessed with books to the exclusion of all else, including having children, <br>&#149; his brother Maekar I &mdash; As stern, harsh, and unyielding as his great-great-grandson Stannis and even more unpopular but again not crazy, <br>&#149; his son Aegon V &mdash; Sane aside from maybe the Summerhall incident and well-known for his kindness to the smallfolk, <br>&#149; his son Jaehaerys II &mdash; Often considered weak due to his poor health and short reign but thought well of by anyone who actually knew him, managed to do some good things during his brief time <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31cbc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note31cbc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31cbc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">End the Blackfyre Rebellions and reconcile the Great Houses </span> <br>&#149; and his son Aerys II &mdash; Psychopathic pyromaniac.
</div><ul><li> That's only three crazy kings, two borderline crazy kings, and one horribly incompetent one out of the seventeen monarchs. If you want to count the Targaryens who never became kings, only Rhaegal (brother of Aerys I and Maekar), Aerion (brother of Aegon V), and maybe Viserys (brother of Daenerys) were crazy.
</li><li> The Targaryen madness really seems to be prominent in the more recent generations. Aerys II was the craziest of the lot, both of his sons had problems, his daughter isn't that much better (although whether she's actually mad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">is a highly controversial debate topic)</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his possible surviving grandson also has issues (which actually convinces Tyrion that he really is a Targaryen), although his other grandson (who is unaware of his true lineage) is fine other than being pretty emo at times</span>.
<ul><li> While Rhaegar's villainy is currently up in the air, there's no doubt that he was rather delusional. Best case scenario, he ran away with the teenage daughter of a lord paramount (the most powerful noble families) who was engaged to another lord paramount and then proceeded to do nothing while her family was killed by his crazy father (who everyone knew was crazy). All this while he was married to the sister of yet another lord paramount (the "Prince" of Dorne). Worst case, he was a prophecy-obsessed fanatic who raped a young girl until she was pregnant and then left her alone with just a couple knights for company.
</li></ul></li><li> It's unknown how many Targaryens were passed over for the throne due to either mental defects or poor physical health. The insanity problem became prevalent enough that the councils would try to skip over the crazy or sickly Targaryen in the line of succession in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">a more stable younger son or nephew</a>. And in later generations, a significant number were born with moderate to severe mental defects, or "feeble-witted".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4llr5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4llr5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4llr5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This applied to Aerion Blackfyre's daughter and at least several more children, but because they were never seriously considered in the line of succession, little was recorded about them.</span> Even their physical health was eventually effected, with several being intellectually and emotionally normal but possessing such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">fragile immune systems</a> that they suffered from numerous ailments and died young. Stillbirths and cradle deaths were <em>very</em> common, even when you consider that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">this is Westeros</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5kmid');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5kmid" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5kmid');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dany's mother, Queen Rhaella, had no less than two stillbirths, three miscarriages, and three infant sons who were born alive but so sickly that none of them lived more than a year.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>, there once was a King by the name of Palancar who tried to wage war numerous times with the Elves, even though every invasion was a hopeless crusade (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, a historian indicates Palancar was in the early stages of dementia by that point). Eventually his nobles rebelled against him to end the madness and had him exiled into a valley that later inherited his name. The Protagonist and his cousin, and the village they grew up in, descended from Palancar. Paolini so far has acted like that's at least somewhat of a <em>good</em> thing. Then again, he's also trying to convince us that the one who's really Royally Screwed-up is Galby.
</li><li> Fiona Patton's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm">Branion</a> series is set in a fantasy Britain where the gods take an active interest in their followers. The royal family, whose head is called the Aristok, is literally touched by the gods &mdash; the sovereign is the avatar of the Living Flame, a deity/demon/primordial critter which is a sort of symbiotic parasite. This makes the Aristok something of a cross between a hereditary Christ-figure and the real British system of the monarch being head of the church. Not only does the Aristok have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings">divine right</a>, she can prove it. Unfortunately, being the physical sacred vessel-on-earth of a <em>fire god</em> is bad for your health. Out of forty-one monarchs, sixteen have died young, been assassinated, or committed suicide, and many of the rest went insane. Three even converted to a completely different faith, which made for real cognitive dissonance among their followers as well as themselves. Whether this system is a blessing or a curse on the royal family is clearly up in the air.
</li><li> The first two of Mervyn Peake's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gormenghast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gormenghast">Gormenghast</a></em> books are, among other things, a long examination of this trope &mdash; the Groan lineage and their staff are a bunch of depressed lunatics, their spirits both crushed and perversely sustained by the castle and its ancient, messed-up rituals. They are a sympathetic bunch though &mdash; the melancholy and bookish Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Sepulchrave</a> and his unloved, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">cloudcuckoolander</a> daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">Fuchsia</a> must surely be among the most tragic literary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">woobies</a> of the last century.
</li><li> Zigzagged throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels.
<ul><li> Historically, the rulers of Ankh-Morpork have tended to be raving psychopaths. This may have been somewhat genetic while the city was a monarchy and rulers' marriages were arranged to maintain the royal blood and survival tended to favor those homicidal enough to keep ahead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>. However, even after the kings were overthrown and replaced by the non-hereditary Patricians, the stress of the job and the absolute power that came with it turned pretty much everyone who held it some flavor of barking mad. The last two Patricians were known as "Mad Lord Snapcase" and "Homicidal Lord Winder". By a stroke of <em>incredible</em> good fortune the current Patrician, Lord Havelock Vetinari, is not only sane but an utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> and as insurance, the rightful heir to the line of kings is also hanging around the city, and he's also sane-ish, as he was raised by dwarfs (his adoptive father was in fact a king, but among dwarfs that job corresponds to "mine director" and appears to be elective, not hereditary).
</li><li> The old noble houses of Ankh-Morpork, from which the Patricians are usually chosen, certainly haven't done themselves any favors through repeated intermarriage but, as with the royal line, this is implied to have contributed less to their overall unpleasantness than the self-selection towards dimwitted murder-happy prats (because of the military service requirement) and the self-absorption encouraged by privilege.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em> zigzags this with the Agatean Emperor. While his insanity is suggested to have a dash of genetic inbreeding behind it, the book hints (yet <em>again</em>) that <em>intentionally</em> breeding for paranoia and psychopathy, and then not telling the offspring why cruelty is bad, may have actually played a larger role than how closely related his parents were. Lord Hong, the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, subverts the trope entirely by simply being a self-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> without any of Vetinari's redeeming scruples.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em> thankfully manages to avoid this, although it is specifically mentioned that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> had intended to wed the protagonist with his aunt in order to keep the royal line <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood">"pure"</a>.
</li><li> Played utterly straight when one book describes the lineage of kings in other Discworld city-states, and cites the last King of Quirm as having been so inbred he repeatedly tried to mate with himself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance">Jack Vance</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lyonesse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lyonesse">Lyonesse</a></em> trilogy, the king of South Ulfland's single son, Prince Quilcy, is feeble-minded and spends his days playing with fanciful doll-houses.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall</a></em> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>, the Copper Isles royalty tend to have madness crop up now and then, including one Princess Josiane. A character phrases it thus: "There's bad blood in the Copper Isles kings. They birth a mad one every generation. Josiane's uncle is locked in a tower somewhere. It comes from being an island kingdom &mdash; too much inbreeding." It turns out in further novels that it may not be just one per generation...
<ul><li> Two per generation, as of the Trickster books. The old king who dies and prompts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> and his brother who was mentioned as locked in a tower somewhere, and Josiane and Imajane among the old king's kids.
</li><li> The Jimajen line might also have bits of this, though we only see two members: Rubinyan, whose only major flaws are an overdeveloped sense of honor and an inability to control his insane wife; and Bronau, who is extremely egotistical and ambitious without much common sense to go with it. Big brother is also ambitious as hell, but much more sensible...
</li><li> Emperor Ozorne of Carthak and that cousin of the Tusaine line who starts the Tusaine-Tortall war in the second Song of the Lioness book both count.
</li><li> Duke Roger, nephew to King Roald in the Song of the Lioness quartet, wasn't insane to begin with, but coming back from the dead (or not, precisely, if you believe him) certainly screwed with his head.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner">Tam&iacute;r Trilogy</a></em> (<em>The Bone Doll's Twin</em>, <em>Hidden Warrior</em>, and <em>The Oracle's Queen</em>) hereditary madness has hit the royal line. What makes this particularly dangerous is that the country's god has declared that only women of that bloodline can become ruler... or else. At the end...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the sanest remaining member of the royal line takes the throne and the madness that caused the whole situation is just never mentioned again, since the epilogue indicates that there were no problems for centuries afterwards.</span>
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series with the Star Kingdom of Manticore. Aside from being a constitutional monarchy, which limits the potential damage, Manticoran monarchs and heirs apparent are specifically prohibited from marrying members of the aristocracy. Aside from the "keeping in touch with the common folk" goal, it also removes the problems of inbreeding.
<ul><li> He swiped this from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith">E. E. &#147;Doc&#148; Smith</a>'s <em>Family d'Alembert</em> series; under the Stanley Doctrine, nobility <em>could</em> marry commoners, but royalty was <em>required</em> to marry a commoner. While this helped, this was not totally successful in keeping loonies from the Imperial Throne (granted, the case of Empress "Mad Stephanie" could have been situational rather than genetic.)
<ul><li> In the case of the Stanley Dynasty, it may be as much cultural as genetic. At one point the competent, sane, and decent Emperor William (who is definitely an exception to the run of his ancestors) makes a joke about his and his wife's decision to abdicate at his age 70, so their daughter Edna "won't have to kill us." Edna is horrified by the joke, but her father points out that if he'd been more grasping and determined to hang on to power forever, decent Edna might have turned out different too, because, as he notes, 'like begets like'.
</li></ul></li><li> The author even points out that if the Monarch is really bonkers, Impeachment is in the Constitution, with Parliament choosing the new Monarch from any person in the Kingdom.
<ul><li> And before being added to the official line of succession, the Monarch's offspring have to pass a psychological and intelligence evaluation.
</li></ul></li><li> The Andermani Emperors on the other hand are competent but sometimes <em>strange</em>: the first emperor thought he was a reincarnation of Friedrich der Grosse (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Prussia</a>). Another was dethroned when he not only talked to his prize rose bush but also tried to make it chancellor.
<ul><li> And he was deposed by his own sister, who, while generally considered the best Andermani Emperor ever, had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing">legally declare herself a man</a>, due to their Salic Law succession. May not have been the best decision for her own mental state.
</li><li> It's hinted the reason why they are so successful is that the insanity and the genius go together. After all founding a New Prussian Empire on a Chinese colony world and making it into a regional power does sound pretty nuts.

<ul><li> Though, considering the political climate in the Gubierno Civil, the line between clinical paranoia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">sane, reasonable social caution</a> is slim indeed. The <em>only</em> reasons the POV character isn't a threat to the throne are his incorruptible idealism and his sure knowledge of the disaster that will ensue if he tries to take the throne for himself. Also, while the Cleretts my or my not be insane, they are also competent, if perhaps not excellent, political and military leaders.

Most pureblood wizarding families (with a few exceptions, like the Weasleys, who aren't hostile to mixed or Muggle-born in-laws) have gone this direction in recent decades, as the limited gene pool means they're all increasingly interrelated. Arthur Weasley says at one point that purebloods by the current definition will probably die out within a couple generations, as so many of them are already first cousins and within the incest taboo. Ironically, the Death Eaters probably managed to hasten this extinction quite a bit since many purebloods died in the fighting or were consigned to Azkaban afterwards.
<ul><li> The Gaunts are even <em>more</em> messed up and inbred than most purebloods, since Dumbledore mentions that they were the only remaining descendants of Salazar Slytherin and Marvolo was obsessed with the inferiority of other families. Ironically, the worst member of the family is conceived when they finally manage to get some new blood: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lord Voldemort</a>, the son of Merope Gaunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">and a Muggle</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, the first king of the Noldor, Finw&euml;, is a good man, but after his death, the crown goes to his eldest son F&euml;anor, who was very paranoid before, and became completely crazy (if still very charismatic) when his father was murdered. Once F&euml;anor is also dead, his son Maedhros should become king...but he averts this trope: knowing how dangerous the Oath he and his brothers have sworn is, he abdicates and lets his uncle rule. It's a wise move: the sons of F&euml;anor do commit some horrendous acts, and the two eldest eventually become insane, but at least they only rule a fraction of the Noldor.
<ul><li> The royal family of N&uacute;menor also develop into this, as they become more and more jealous of the Elves for their long life, and determined to find a way to live forever.

Witness David, whose punishment for committing adultery with Bathsheba and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">having her husband killed</a> was that his first son by her fell ill and died a week later, and the rest of the sons started killing each other for various reasons. David ultimately appoints Solomon as his successor, and even then the succession crisis doesn't end. Solomon was also messed up in his own right on account of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRuinsTheRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRuinsTheRealm">harem of foreign wives.</a>

And the newly-crowned Selenay plays it to the hilt to keep her councilors from forcing her into marriage, too. The requirement that all monarchs must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Heralds</a> is also very important &mdash; there's nothing saying a Herald can't be a bit nuts (Hi, Lavan and Vanyel!), but at least it's the type of nuts that doesn't result in the abuses seen on the rest of this page.
</li><li> King Rodric IV in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em>. Hated and abused by his father for being a sickly runt, he proved to be as sick in mind as he was in body. Apart from using openly about how his power would allow him to randomly pick out random people and have them executed for no reason other than he wished to see them die, he squandred much of the tax revenues of The Kingdom Of The Isles on a series of aesthetic public works programs designed merely to make the city of Rillanon look prettier. Worse still, he denied vital military aid to the Western half of his Kingdom, fearing that the soldiers would be used to build an army against him, which helped to drag the first Riftwar out for the better part of a decade.

Phillips's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuestOfTheUnaligned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuestOfTheUnaligned">The Quest of the Unaligned</a>. The royal house of the realm of Caederan, instead of being tied to one of the four elemental magics, are tied to all of them as the result of an ancient magical bargain binding the King and Queen to Caederan itself. Unfortunately, this means that if the King and Queen favor one element over the others, this will throw the land itself out of whack. A few decades before the story started, King Kethel and Queen Tathilya became increasingly infatuated with the power of air, which also had the side effect of causing them to become increasingly flighty and absent-minded. As the Balance fell further and further towards wind, the country was wracked by droughts, tornadoes, cyclones, and other catastrophes. When Queen Tathilya became pregnant, the nobles realized that if the new prince was raised in the royal court, he to would become infatuated with air magic. The nobles launched a desperate bid to separate Prince Alaric from the ruahk-controlled Court, and thus begins the plot.

</li><li> It also turns out that Paul and Alia Atreides are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harkonnens too, thanks to their mother who is Vladimir&#146;s biological daughter</span>. Paul is not much of a monster like his grandpa as most of his detractors think; it&#146;s just that he fell in a prescient trap and couldn&#146;t control things such as his rabid followers.

Emperor Cartagia was as bad as any fiction-version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>, and apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">modeled after him</a>. Interestingly, the position of Emperor does not seem to be connected to any individual line for more than a few generations; it appears to be totally normal for the Centauri nobles to hand the throne to a new House even though the old imperial house still exists (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Londo rules as Mollari II, as one of his ancestors had held the throne once</span>). This presumably means that Cartagia's madness was a relatively rare occurrence in his House &mdash; rather as the Julio-Claudians only had two Emperors who could be called insane (Caligula and Nero), only one of whom (Caligula) was <em>totally</em> bonkers (Nero, while an awful ruler, was not <em>totally</em> incompetent; he was just very young when he took the throne, too obsessed with drama&mdash;in both senses&mdash;and not very well brought up).

Writer Bryan Cogman confirmed that the reason she became the first person on Dragonstone to embrace the new Lord of Light religion (even before Stannis) is because she couldn't process that the Seven would let her unborn sons die, so like many people in traumatic situations, she fanatically embraced a new religion.

</li><li> Miya: The only one to get away from this <em>relatively</em> clean. Indisputably Nex and Iffrita's daughter, she is a sickly little girl who cannot even comprehend how messed up her family is. Xix, Ninurta and Nex all care for her deeply (the former initially in opposition to his own vendetta) the fact that she actually looks like Nex often causes people to draw comparisons with how Ninurta does not.

Depending on the version of the myth you hear, Uranus was either Gaia's brother, son, or a completely unrelated entity; regardless, they proceeded to have three groups of children, two of which (the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes) turned out monstrously ugly. The third group proceeded to intermarry with each other and have kids of their own; one such pairing resulted in the births of Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia, who then proceeded to marry and/or sleep with each other, each other's kids, and on at least one occasion grandma Gaia herself. While they had more than their fair share of family drama to go around, the later generations were remarkably free from physical deformities and mental illness, with the standout exception being Hephaestus, son of Hera and sometimes Zeus.

</li><li> While all the Great Houses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> have had issues with sanity-challenged rulers, the Liao dynasty of the Capellan Confederation has it the worst by far. Maxmillion Liao was driven nuts after falling to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Hanse Davion's</a> schemes in the 4th Succession War and was left a broken shell until his death. His daughter Romano was far worse: she was a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a> for Justin Allard and went right off the deep end when he turned out to be Hanse Davion's double-agent. She spent the next few decades becoming increasingly paranoid and instituting numerous bloody purges of her own people as a result of that paranoia, further crippling the badly battered realm. Her son, Sun Tzu, was mostly sane (though he had his moments) but her daughter, Kali, was completely off the deep end and believed herself to be the actual Hindu diety. The fact that the Capellan state religion views House Liao as actual divine beings certainly didn't help in that regard, either. Kali was responsible for organizing numerous terrorist attacks in the Confederation and on other worlds. And then there's Daoshen, Sun Tzu's heir. Again, he believes himself to be a god, he's hyper-aggressive and paranoid, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">his niece is actually his daughter</a>.</span> Insanity doesn't just run in the family, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ArsenicAndOldLace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ArsenicAndOldLace">it practically gallops</a>.

Most of them are temporal royalty of some sort as well.
<ul><li> The Bortisis are related to Ivana Bortisi, Darklord of Borca, although most of them run the Bortisi Trading Company. While they aren't cursed as badly as the others in this list, they do have a definite thing for poisons.
</li><li> The d'Honaires are related to Dominic d'Honaire, Darklord of Dementlieu. They tend to be sickly but with a gift for healing, and to be either kindhearted and empathic or cold-blooded sociopaths. d'Honaires in Dementlieu are also immune to supernatural mental modification, as part of Dominic's curse.
</li><li> The Dilisnya are related to Ivan Dilisnya, co-Darklord of Borca (and also Camille, previous darklord of Borca before Ivana poisoned her). They're largely known as the core of a massive criminal network.
</li><li> The Drakovs are related to Vlad Drakov, Darklord of Falkovnia and blatant Vlad the Impaler expy. They have a tendency for berserking, and they are cursed to always end up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> if they accept a place in the family. Also, most people hate them because of their progenitor's terrible reputation.
</li><li> The Godefroys are related to Wilfred Godefroy, Darklord of Mordent (although not directly, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaterFamilicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaterFamilicide">Pater Familicide</a>). They are largely sickly, as well as natural mediums.
</li><li> The Hiregaard family is related to Tristen Hiregaard, ruler of Nova Vaasa. They are cursed with a tendency towards insanity, especially if they commit evil acts.
</li><li> The Mordenheims are related to Viktor Mordenheim, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who created Lamordia's flesh golem Darklord Adam, and is cursed along with him.

</li><li> The Reniers are related to Jaqueline Renier, Darklord of Richemulot. The family is also tainted with a wererat branch, resulting in even human Reniers being vulnerable to infection with wererat-style lycanthropy (the natural wererats are cursed so that one in every six children born to a wererat mother will be pure human). They're also cursed with a potentially fatal allergy to something innocuous.
</li><li> The Von Zaroviches are related to Strahd von Zarovich, Darklord of Barovia (but not directly- he doesn't have any children) and have no less than <em>four</em> family curses- susceptibility to the attentions of the Dark Powers, chronic nightmares, berserker rages, and being prone to visions of horror if wounded in battle. Thankfully they need not all apply to the same person at once. They are prone to being evil, but this isn't universal.

During the most decadent period of the Empire's history, it's implied that inbreeding reached epic proportions and led to actual mutations among the nobility. They seem to have straightened things out for the most part by the "present day" though.

<ul><li> On one hand, the Emperor brought a new golden age to the galaxy and most of his sons were initially stable (The exceptions being Kurze, a murderous sociopath; Angron, a blood-crazed berserker; Lorgar, a raving zealot; Alpharius, who had colossal delusions of grandeur; and quite possibly the twins, whose names were wiped from history for reasons unknown). On the far less lenient hand, he was also a stubborn egomaniac who couldn't be bothered to change his mind when he started ruling humanity. His intolerant holier-than-thou attitude on his sons (<em>especially</em> Lorgar) drove some to madness, which started the fall.
</li></ul></li><li> The Navigators have a special mutation that happens to be great for getting through the Warp quickly, making them vital to the Imperium's functioning. Said mutation is also recessive. Because of this, it's essentially required that they only produce offspring with other navigators, who make up a number of noble families on Terra. When you consider that mutations are common in the setting, they already have a mutation anyway, and they're given relative carte blanche to have as many mutations as they want, many scions of navigator families end up being genetic tumbleweeds who barely even look human after generations of inbreeding.

Of course, interbreeding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">with the Habsburg line</a> didn't help.

<ul><li> Candy Kingdom Law, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, is "complicated," according to Princess Bubblegum. In the event that anything should happen to PB, who inherits the throne? Her maladjusted, overly-sensitive, socially awkward, most likely brain-damaged, insensitive, angry, sour-tempered, alienated son/science experiment gone wrong, the Earl of Lemongrab. Arguably, Lemongrab is a pretty sympathetic example of this trope&mdash;he obviously has a... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">delicate condition</a>, but that doesn't stop everyone from despising his guts for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> most of the time and sending everyone to the dungeon for a million years. But why stop there? When the princess realizes her errors, she must create a second heir. This time, she brings her own DNA into the equation in an attempt to stabilize the formula. Enter the giant, pink, infantile being Goliad. Princess Bubblegum wants to educate her in all the ways of royalty and leadership and Finn and Jake are tasked to teach her. However, Goliad's "mondo mama brains" have an extreme imprint. Just seeing Jake yell at a group of preschoolers in order to keep them quiet send her into an authoritarian state in which everyone is forced to follow her rules. Then Goliad pulls out her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye">Third Eye</a> and begins to control the citizens of the Candy Kingdom with mind control and telekinesis. If not for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stormo, a being created by Finn's DNA</span>, the kingdom would have fallen.
<ul><li> Surely the Candy Kingdom can't have all the fun. There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Nightosphere</a> and the Vampire Kingdom, controlled by the Abadeers, respectively Hunson and Marceline. Hunson, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Lord of Chaos</a>, controls the strange tortures that flood the Nightosphere. Mutilation, immolation, bananas coming out of orifices; all done in pure glee. His daughter, Marceline the Vampire Queen, is seen less as a ruler and more a fickle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">trickster</a>. If she has royal obligations, she completely ignores them.
<ul><li> At one point, Marceline was tricked into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becoming the Lord of Chaos by <em>her own father</em>. This made her even more disturbing as she would line up those in the Nightosphere and hand out punishments on whim, giving choices like "pain, pleasure, or weird punishment" and asking if someone wanted abs (which she placed on the person's head)</span>.

Every monarchy has <em>something</em>. Arranged (roughly) by country:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain">Britain</a>:
<ul><li> Henry VI had a mental illness of some sort which left him near-catatonic for long periods. It may have been hereditary &mdash; his grandfather Charles VI of France is also on this page &mdash; but some theories suggest his mental health declined significantly as England's losses mounted in the final stages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a>, culminating in the loss of Bordeaux in August 1453, to which he responded with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness">complete mental breakdown</a> that left him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">totally unresponsive for more than a year</a>. Henry's madness in turn led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>, which effectively purged the English royal line of insanity by almost exterminating it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> started out as a good king &mdash; tough and ambitious, which people liked in a monarch back then. However, as he got older, he grew more cruel and egotistical (as many of his wives discovered). Theories differ on why, but they generally point to something happening to him that pushed him off the deep end, whether it be illness, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a> (he's often portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex">a large man</a> but was very fit in his youth), or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">inability to produce a male heir</a>.
</li><li> The sanity of Henry VIII's daughter Queen Mary I (the historical "Bloody Mary") is a question historians have never settled. She sought to re-establish the Catholic church, after her father had dispensed with it in the English Reformation as a way of divorcing her mother, who was then dying of cancer. She responded with a campaign that led to an unusually large number of brutal executions in her six-year reign and brought the country to the point of outright rebellion. She may also have had a "hysterical pregnancy" &mdash; <em>i.e.</em> she was convinced she was pregnant when she really wasn't &mdash; which makes sense, because she was 38 and desperate to produce an heir to head off her very Protestant half-sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a>. For centuries it was assumed to have been extreme wishful thining, but evidence now suggests she had ovarian cysts, or possibly uterine cancer.
</li><li> George III is considered the archetypcal "mad king", although the exact extent of his madness is now disputed. It is believed that he suffered from porphyria, based on contemporary accounts of his urine being bluish purple, but some modern scholars attribute this to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHerb">herbal sedative</a> (the kind of thing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">passed for medicine back then</a>). Porphyria is hereditary, and although its onset often occurs late in life, there was no evidence of it in any of George's Hanoverian ancestors. He certainly wasn't <em>always</em> mad; he was considered quite charming and reasonably well-adjusted when he was younger, so his "madness" may have just been garden-variety dementia. The famous incident where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToPlants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToPlants">conversed with a tree</a> thinking it was the king of Prussia was isolated, happened late in his life, and could well have been made up by his son George IV, who resented having to rule as prince regent in his father's latter years (and had his own share of issues what with the incessant partying and gambling &mdash; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> the Third</em>'s portrayal of him isn't <em>that</em> exaggerated). Thankfully, by this time, Parliament had enough power that a "sane-ish" monarch was good enough.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a>:
<ul><li> Philip IV "le Bel" was famous for effectively disbanding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">The Knights Templar</a>, and much of the misfortune that visited the French monarchy since then (note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchPoliticalSystem">it no longer exists</a>) is said to be the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">curse</a> by the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, who was burned at the stake.
</li><li> Charles VI was commonly said to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness">Driven to Madness</a> by two traumatic events: the first a case of sunstroke, and the second was the notorious "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_des_Ardents">Ball of the Burning Men<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" in which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">was almost set on fire</a>. He was the grandfather of Henry VI of England, and Britons tend to blame Henry's madness on Charles, but Charles' French offspring was quite rational and intelligent (at least by the standards of the day).
</li><li> The Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me, son of Charles X, is more on the pathetic side. Unlike his father and his more charismatic brother, the Duke of Berry, he was frail, prone to nervous tics, and probably impotent, which at least prevented him from having even more screwed up offspring with his wife and first cousin, Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, daughter of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. He did ascend the French throne during the July Revolution... for all of 20 minutes, and even then most Legitimist partisans refused to acknowledge his claim to the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain">Spain</a>:
<ul><li> The Trast&aacute;mara family was known for its history of oddballs, although they had a lot of enemies who were prone to exaggerating the family's eccentricities. Peter I was known in Old Spanish as <em>Iuste&ccedil;ero</em>, roughly meaning "bringer of justice", which had a double meaning of excellence in execution of policy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">of people</a>. As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse">The Cartoon History of the Universe</a></em> put it: "I'm Pedro el Cruel! What can I do to you?" He wasn't actually a member of the House &mdash; it was founded by his half-brother, who was sane but illegitimate &mdash; but he still gets lumped in with them.
</li><li> The by-word for Spanish royal insanity is Queen Joanna of Aragon and Castille, commonly known as "Juana la Loca" &mdash; "Joanna the Mad". The extent of her madness is a matter of debate. Scholars suggest it derives roughly equally from genetics (she is theorised to have at least some form of hereditary depression) and her unhappy family life &mdash; which, given the nature of royal families, is heavily intertwined with politics.
<ul><li> Joanna was the product of a very strategic political union. Her father Ferdinand was King of Aragon and from the House of Trast&aacute;mara (which produced the aforementioned Peter I). Her mother Isabella was Queen of Castille in her own right, and Joanna inherited both and was a legitimate queen. However, being a woman, she became a catalyst for all the men in her life trying to exert power through her. Ferdinand basically considered himself king of both Aragon and Castile and was particularly intent on exerting power.
</li><li> Joanna's husband was Philip the Handsome, Duke of Burgundy, the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a> Maximilian I. Philip was from the House of Habsburg, a famous and powerful royal family &mdash; so much so that they engaged in <em>extensive</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">Royal Inbreeding</a> to prevent power from falling into the wrong hands. They wouldn't marry non-royalty (it was beneath them), they wouldn't marry their enemies (of course), and after the Protestant Reformation, they wouldn't marry non-Catholics either (unless they converted). All of this drastically reduced the pool of possible marriage partners, so they kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">marrying their cousins</a> as the only people they could trust. Philip's marriage to Joanna was a strategic union, and a politically shrewd one, but it only bought them a little time (especially as the Trast&aacute;mara family was already pretty inbred, so it wasn't a great source of genetic diversity).
</li><li> As it turned out, it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>, and much of Joanna's "madness" can be traced to Philip's untimely death. Philip provided ample competition for Ferdinand in the game of "Control the Damsel", and "husband" usually trumps "father" in that game &mdash; Philip declared himself King of Castille <em>jure uxoris</em> (by right of marriage) to try and talk some sense into Ferdinand, but to no avail. Joanna much preferred Philip to Ferdinand, and when Philip died, she kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">lost it</a>. After several attempts to reopen her husband's casket, and a few political and military defeats, Ferdinand had her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadwomanInTheAttic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadwomanInTheAttic">locked up in a nunnery</a> and exercised as much control as he could. That lasted until Joanna's son Charles I &mdash; who was Holy Roman Emperor Charles V &mdash; was old enough to exert himself in his own right. Charles' successors split into Austrian and Spanish branches, who kept intermarrying, leading to problems down the line.
</li><li> There's a sort of interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">divergence point</a> in history here. Joanna's younger sister was Catherine of Aragon, first wife of Henry VIII of England. Their daughter Mary, in the grand Habsburg tradition, married her cousin Philip II, Charles V's son. They never had children (and Philip eventually remarried his niece Anne of Austria) &mdash; but if they had, and England had managed to stay Catholic, that could have given the Habsburgs control of damn near half of Europe if things had shaken out right &mdash; but perhaps at the cost of the integrity of the English royal bloodline.
</li></ul></li><li> Don Carlos, the rebellious son of Philip II and grandson of Charles V, was insane to the point of being physically dangerous and would take swipes at passing servants with a knife. Philip ended up removing him from the line of succession on the basis that he was unfit for the throne, and he spent the last six months of his life under house arrest.
</li><li> Charles II of Spain was the last Habsburg King of Spain. They called him "Carlos el Hechizado" or "Charles the Bewitched", and it's not hard to see why &mdash; that's his portrait in the page image, and that's as <em>flattering</em> as they could make it. He was severely physically <em>and</em> mentally disabled, mostly as a result of the extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">Royal Inbreeding</a> practised by the Habsburg family &mdash; he was descended from "Juana la Loca" <em>fourteen</em> times. That chin is the most prominent example of the famous "Habsburg lip", which he had so prominently that he couldn't close his mouth (that's why his tongue is poking out). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> describes Charles as "short, lame, epileptic, senile, and completely bald before 35, always on the verge of death but repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWontYouDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWontYouDie">baffling Christendom by continuing to live</a>."

(in a distinct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanDialects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanDialects">Viennese dialect</a> that Germans often associate with amiable cluelessness). As Ferdinand had no children (and again may have been incapable of it), his disabilities didn't continue down the line, and he abdicated in favour of his saner (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">workaholic</a>) nephew Franz Joseph, who would reign until 1916.
</li><li> Franz Joseph, meanwhile, married his first cousin Elisabeth, popularly known as Sisi. She is speculated to have suffered from some sort of <em>anorexia nervosa</em> &mdash; not a good combination with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">workaholic</a> husband. Their only son Rudolf was a total playboy &mdash; which, given the famous Habsburg restrictions on marriage, did <em>not</em> sit well with his parents.

One of them, his lover Mary Vetsera, eventually obliged him, and they were both found dead in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayerling_incident">Mayerling Incident<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It devastated his parents' marriage, in part because they were already split on the question of whether Hungary should be allowed to split, and Rudolf's death accelerated nationalist sentiment in the Empire. Meanwhile, Rudolf had left no heir, and the heir-presumptive became Archduke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranzFerdinand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranzFerdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a>, who himself had a falling-out with Franz Joseph over not marrying a royal in the Habsburg tradition (he married a Czech countess). Franz Ferdinand never got to be Emperor, as he was famously assassinated in 1914 in an event that triggered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> is made up of different places who used to have kings:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria">Ludwig II of Bavaria</a> was considered by many to be mad. He was known as the "fairytale king", in part because his particular brand of "insanity" was an obsession with building elaborate castles, swans, opera music, and beautiful men (he was believed to possibly have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">gay</a>). His brother Otto was also considered mad and institutionalised &mdash; some Bavarians claim they inherited their madness from their Prussian mother Marie, pointing to the case of her uncle Frederick William IV, also commonly believed to have been mad<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note128oco');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note128oco" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note128oco');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Modern scholarship suggests he was not mad, but rather suffered a stroke in his later years, which his Bavarian consort Queen Elisabeth tried to hide from the public</span>. Ludwig was the last "real" King of Bavaria &mdash; he was deposed by his government (based on a "remote diagnosis" by Bernhard von Gudden, the validity of which has since been drawn into question), then mysteriously died the next day (along with Gudden). This left his brother Otto king, even though he had already been institutionalised &mdash; he spent his entire "reign" in an asylum.
</li><li> Frederick William I of Prussia had porphyria, and also liked to carry a wooden cane, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaneFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaneFu">much to the regret of everyone around him</a> (who naturally couldn't defend themselves without being accused of treason). He was known for chasing his children around the palace and randomly attacking commoners in the streets of Berlin, hollering, "You're supposed to love me, not fear me!" This seems to have had a negative effect in his relationship with his son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a>, although the mutual intense antipathy between the two surely didn't help.
</li><li> Countess Anna de Coligny (1624-80) was distantly related to the Kings of England and Prussia. She suffered from an illness of <em>some</em> sort, although it's not certain what it was. Her problems started young, when was reported to have tried to climb up the tapestries hanging from a wall after a seizure, and she did not get better. Four of her five daughters also went crazy (one had to be locked up in an apartment with padded walls). Her surviving son, while not insane, was very promiscuous and thought it would be a good idea for some of his illegitimate children to marry their half-siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> absolutely had its share of lunatic emperors &mdash; everything we saw in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em> was just the tip of the iceberg. But historians are split on exactly <em>why</em> they were nuts. Was it inbreeding? Was it a lust for power? Was it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">well-seated paranoia</a> for fear of being offed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note137m1w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note137m1w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note137m1w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only 29 out of 88 Byzantine Emperors died of natural causes, and at least a dozen were murdered by their own relatives</span>? Was it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">exaggerated -- or even invented</a> &mdash; by much later historians like Tacitus and Suetonius as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">historical revisionism</a>? Were they the victims of undiagnosed lead poisoning that gradually eroded their mental faculties? All this is a matter of debate, although it is interesting how relatively few Roman Emperors inherited their job; Romans were so acutely aware of the possibility of the natural heir being completely off their rocker that they often adopted someone they preferred as their successor (or the army installed someone <em>they</em> liked).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a>:
<ul><li> It seemed like no Russian tsar trusted anyone in their family. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_III_of_Russia">Ivan "the Great"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> started a brutal war because he clashed so hard with his brothers. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible">Ivan "the Terrible"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had a particular brand of crazy that caused him to go through wives &mdash; and children &mdash; at an impressive rate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a>, despite being the man who modernised and Westernised Russia, had a notoriously difficult relationship with his son Alexei. But none could surpass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>. She married into the family, but turned out to be more capable than her husband <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_III_of_Russia">Peter III<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, whom history portrays as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">manchild</a> with a military fetish who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">essentially an ardent Russophobe</a> &mdash; his death is commonly believed to have been at Catherine's orders, allowing her to become Empress in her own right. She also had a <em>very</em> contentious relationship with her son Paul, who was an extraordinarily difficult person himself (he would exile officers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">to Siberia</a> for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">misplaced coat button</a>) and likely organised <em>his</em> assassination to ensure the throne to her favourite grandson, Alexander I. (Alexander probably consented to all this, at least tacitly, but he did feel horrendously guilty about it and perhaps never intended for him to be assassinated outright.)
</li><li> The latter years of the Romanov dynasty were notable for the prominence of haemophilia, a hereditary trait which could be traced back to the British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> &mdash; she was a carrier, three of her children got the gene, and from there it spread to many other European royal houses. Nicholas II's son Alexei, the last legitimate heir to the Romanov dynasty before they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanovsAndRevolutions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanovsAndRevolutions">all executed</a>, was a notable sufferer, and the faith-healer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Rasputin the Mad Monk</a> quickly built his reputation on his ability to "treat" it. The haemophilia gene would become such a prominent genetic marker of royalty that the 1950s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a> <em>Queen of Blood</em> decided that the extraterrestrial must be royalty solely because she was a haemophiliac. That is one impressive little allele.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">Imperial China</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi</a>, the very first emperor, started an unfortunate trend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">emperors and noblemen seeking "immortality elixirs"</a> that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">dodgy enough to be fatal</a>. Shihuangdi experimented extensively with mercury, which turned him from a fundamentally sound monarch into a total paranoiac. He eventually took it a step too far by taking pills containing <em>pure</em> mercury, which killed him in 220 BCE. And yet, for over a thousand years after that, people kept experimenting with mercury, thinking that it was just too a high a concentration that killed Shihuangdi (technically correct, but not especially helpful), and dismissing the side effects as signs that the medicine was working. This is how the <em>exact same thing</em> happened to the last good Tang Emperor Xu&#257;nzong, who similarly degenerated into a paranoid wreck, except he died of chronic rather than acute mercury poisoning in 859 CE. The last Chinese emperor to die of mercury poisoning was the Qing Emperor Yongzheng, as late as 1735. In fact, the only dynasty to be completely unaffected by mercury poisoning is the Yuan dynasty (the Mongol dynasty of Kublai Khan, which tended to look down on Chinese alchemy in general when it wasn't making gunpowder).
</li><li> This led to the downfall of the Northern Qi. Gao Wei, the second-to-last Northern Qi Emperor, was infamously corrupt and badly damaged his own army by killing its best commanders. In 573 CE, he became convinced that his much saner and more popular cousin, Gao Chang Gong, was plotting against him, so he had him poised. Gao Chang Gong happened to be the Northern Qi's <em>greatest</em> general, having famously defeated 100,000 Northern Zhou soldiers with an army of only 500. Without him, when the Northern Zhou attacked again, the kingdom didn't stand a chance; Gao Wei was overthrown and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingFamilyMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingFamilyMassacre">murdered along with most of his relatives</a>.
</li><li> When Zhou Emperor Zhen Ding died, he was succeeded by his oldest son, who became King Ai. King Ai only reigned for three months before he was murdered by his younger brother, who became King Si. Five months later King Si was murdered by <em>his</em> younger brother. King Kao, the third of the brothers, managed to stay on the throne for fourteen years. He had a younger brother, Prince Jie, but luckily for Kao &mdash; and the kingdom, which had already endured the deaths of three kings in one year &mdash; Jie was content with the title of Duke of Western Zhou and didn't murder his brother to become king.
</li><li> The Liu Song dynasty lasted only 59 years, in which time it had an astonishing number of tyrannical emperors:
<ul><li> Crown Prince Liu Shao paid a witch to curse his father Emperor Wen and cause his death. When Wen found out about his son's plot, he decided to depose him, but Liu Shao struck first, had the emperor assassinated, claimed the throne, and promptly executed many of his cousins. Liu Shao's half-brother Liu Jun raised a rebellion, overthrew him, and had Liu Shao and his sons beheaded and forced Liu Shao's wives and daughters to commit suicide.
</li><li> As Emperor, Liu Jun was embroiled in multiple scandals. He slept with many of his female cousins, forced several of his brothers to commit suicide, and reportedly even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">slept with his mother</a>.
</li><li> Liu Jun was succeeded by his teenaged son Liu Zi Ye. Shortly after taking the throne, Zi Ye had his great-uncle executed, gouged out his eyes, and kept them preserved. Then he started an affair with his aunt and personally murdered her husband. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Then he killed officials who tried to stop him.</a> Finally a surviving official had enough and assassinated Liu Zi Ye.
</li></ul></li><li> Liu Zi Ye was succeeded by his uncle Liu Yu, who became increasingly paranoid and killed almost all of his brothers and nephews. Officials who displeased him were executed, often by being disembowelled or having their hearts cut out.
</li><li> Liu Yu's son, also called Liu Yu, took the throne when he was only nine. He quickly became as violent as his father. He personally cut people open, and even became depressed if a day went by without killing someone. He was eventually assassinated by an attendant he had threatened to kill.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a>: Yoshihito, known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taisho">Emperor Taisho<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, was known for his bizarre behaviour in his later years, likely due to a combination of historic inbreeding and a bout of meningitis he suffered when he was weeks old and probably left him brain-damaged. During a parade, he reportedly hopped off the royal float and hugged a random trumpet player in the accompanying band, and also behaved rather weirdly during the inaguration of the Japanese Parliament in 1913. As a result, he was kept out of view of the public as much as possible.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey">Ottoman Empire</a> was known for this not because of genetics, but rather because of their upbringing. It started with Sultan Ahmed I, who decided to protect his heir, his younger brother Mustafa, from potential threats to his ascension &mdash; by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">locking him in a corner of his palace</a>. This took an enormous toll on the young prince, who by the time of Ahmed's death was a psychological wreck with severe neurosis and hallucinations. He lasted barely a year before the courtiers locked him up again (only to bring him out a second time, again lasting barely a year). He was succeeded by Ahmed's sons, who were barely saner, heavily paranoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">Mood Swingers</a>. Ahmed's first son Osman was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> who used courtiers for target practice with his longbow. His second son Murad was a choleric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who had almost all of his viziers executed and imprisoned a lot of Istanbul's population for trivial offences like drinking coffee. His last son Ibrahim was straight-up nicknamed "the mad", not for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> but for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">how many women he impregnated</a> (which was better than the alternative, because Murad had no children and slaughtered almost all of his half-brothers during his reign). Most historians today consider this one of the main reasons for the gradual collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark">Denmark</a> gives us the Oldenburg dynasty. It was fine until <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_VII_of_Denmark">Christian VII<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who suffered from mental illness, hallucinations, and paranoia. He had to rule by proxy for long periods of time, and his illness led to the <em>Struensee affair</em>, in which his own physician took control as his proxy and turned out to be the most sensible ruler Denmark had had for decades &mdash; until he was toppled in a coup and executed. Christian's son Frederick VI had to rule as regent from that point onward, and he was basically set up for failure, having to steer Denmark through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> and screwing up enough to be partly responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly">Norwegian Constituent Assembly</a>. The dynasty died out with Frederick VII, and the Gl&uuml;ksborg branch turned out to be a <em>lot</em> more sensible, but then they were constitutional monarchs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden">Sweden</a> gives us the Wasa family, and in particular <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_XIV_of_Sweden">Eric XIV<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. He started out okay, if kind of bloody and super-efficient at consolidating power from the factionalistic Swedish nobles. Then he got more and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, finding more and more enemies to execute, culminating in the Sture murders, after which he was effectively deposed and imprisoned, where he died shortly thereafter. Interestingly, when he was exhumed centuries later, his bones were found to have been loaded with arsenic, which was a sign that he may have been poisoned &mdash; but arsenic was also a traditional component of the green dye used to make Scandinavian pea soup. So he may have been murdered, or he may have been suffering lifelong arsenic poisoning to explain his erratic behaviour.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Norway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Norway">Norway</a> has seen enough of it that King Harald V was widely suspected of having married a commoner in part to head off the prevalence of this trope. His parents and paternal grandparents were first cousins, and his maternal grandparents were first cousins once removed. When a journalist innocently asked him if part of his desire to marry a commoner included expanding the family's gene pool, Harald responded, "Well, haven't you noticed that everyone in this family is a little weird?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egyptian</a> pharaohs made something of a habit of marrying their eldest sisters, to the extent that archaeologists thought for a while that the claim to the throne passed through the oldest <em>daughter</em> of the late king (keeping male primogeniture would thus have required marrying your sister). The current theory is that it was in fact male-line inheritance and many of these marriages were symbolic, meant to prevent princesses from marrying other men and establishing cadet branches of the royal family. But not all of them were &mdash; the Egyptians <em>really</em> wanted to preserve the bloodline and had a general distaste for marrying non-Egyptians. The Ptolemaic dynasty (which was ethnically Greek but very quickly assimilated to pharaonic tradition) in particular had a M&ouml;bius family tree, which showed in some of the later Ptolemies, Berenices, and Cleopatras<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14y1jn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14y1jn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14y1jn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a>, the one everyone remembers, was considered unusually charming and savvy by her family's standards, which had raised the odd eyebrow for centuries &mdash; genetic lottery win, a more distant Ptolemy than adverised, or an outside contractor entirely?</span>. Some archaeologists and historians believe that the inbreeding was so severe that the Ptolemaic royal family was medically <em>worse</em> than the Habsburgs, with descriptions of obesity, swollen necks, proptosis (bulging eyes), and a recessive trait remarkably similar to the "Habsburg jaw". They were also <em>morally</em> screwed up in several ways:
<ul><li> Ptolemy VIII murdered his nephew to gain the throne, married the mother of that nephew, had an affair with his stepdaughter, and killed his son when the same mother proclaimed him the new Pharaoh. He was described by one Roman writer as having an unattractive face and a belly more like an "animal" than a man.
</li><li> Ptolemy XI was forced to marry his stepmother and half-sister (also possibly his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">biological mother</a>) and murdered her nineteen days later after the marriage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tutankhamun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a> was revealed to be a petri dish of diseases, including the very rare K&ouml;hler disease II, which likely factored into his death. He was also said to have large front incisors, a trait passed down from the Eighteenth Dynasty royal family (1543&#150;1292 BC).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nepal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nepal">Nepal</a> doesn't have a monarchy anymore because of this. The Nepalese monarchy had lasted 240 years when in 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, gunned down most of his relatives &mdash; including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">his parents the king and queen</a> &mdash; and then shot himself. By law, Dipendra was crowned Nepal's new king, despite being comatose and accused of multiple murders. Dipendra quickly succumbed to his injuries, and his uncle Gyanendra was crowned king, despite being widely suspected of having orchestrated the massacre &mdash; so whether it was Dipendra or Gyanendra, Nepal made at least one mass murderer its king. Gyanendra went on to become particularly authoritarian and tried to abolist the Parliament, which so pissed off the Nepalese people that they abolished the monarchy and established a republic (making peace with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Maoist rebels</a> to do so).
</li><li> Ancient Korea:

This made him very unpopular with everyone and ultimately caused his downfall. He raped at least two of his late father's concubines. One of them, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Gyeonghwa">Bayankhutag<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, was a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty">Yuan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> noblewoman. After Chunghye raped her, the Yuan emissary arrested Chunghye and dragged him to Beijing, where he spent the rest of his life as a prisoner.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongmin_of_Goryeo">King Gongmin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Chunghye's half-brother, was every bit as screwed-up. He came to the throne by having Chunghye's fourteen-year-old son deposed and poisoned. During his reign, he raped five underage boys (that we know of). He finally died after he discovered one of his concubines was having an affair with another man; afraid of being executed, the concubine's lover murdered Gongmin in his sleep.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YeonsangunOfJoseon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YeonsangunOfJoseon">Yeonsan-gun of Joseon</a> had the dubious honour of being the worst tyrant in all of Korean history before North Korea became a thing. When he first took the throne, he seemed competent and mentally stable, but that quickly changed. Yeonsan had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">obsession with restoring his late mother's reputation</a>, which led him to launch two purges of the scholars who were even tenuously connected (if at all) to his mother's deposition and execution. He went as far as to punish officials who weren't in the palace when his mother died, on the grounds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">they did nothing to stop it</a>. Two of his father's concubines considered most responsible for his mother's execution were beaten to death. He fatally injured his grandmother during an argument and murdered an official who confronted him about his behaviour. In his later years, he drove people from their houses to build his hunting grounds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">exiled a minister for spilling a drink</a>, and kidnapped a thousand women and turned a former university into his personal brothel. His people finally had enough, staged a coup, and overthrew him. It's no coincidence that even though he reigned as king, he's remembered only as "Prince Yeonsan" (the literal translation of "Yeonsan-gun") and not as "King Yeonsan" (which would be "Yeonsan-wang").
</li><li> King Yeongjo and his son <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_Sado">Crown Prince Sado<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had a difficult relationship, to say the least &mdash; Yeongjo was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">never happy with anything Sado did</a> and went out of his way to publicly humiliate him. Sado, for his part, was already mentally ill, suffering from hallucinations and a bizarre phobia of clothes. Over time, his mental state deteriorated, and he became violent. In 1757, he beheaded a eunuch and carried the severed head around with him. He started killing palace servants, raped ladies-in-waiting, was abusive toward his wife, threatened to kill his sister, and beat his concubine to death. In 1762, Yeongjo dealt with Sado by ordering him to climb into a rice chest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">locking him inside, and leaving him to starve to death</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> officially doesn't have a monarchy, but for all intents and purposes they are run by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRulersOfNorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRulersOfNorthKorea">Kim dynasty</a>, which is a pretty damn messed up family. In accordance with their country's insane propaganda, all three Kims are portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">gods among men</a>, who at various times are said to have magic powers, never urinate or defacate, have invented the hamburger, and have shot a perfect golf game. Their foreign policy amounts to an extreme isolationism and desperate attempts to develop nuclear weapons to keep all the "enemies" at bay. And their fickleness certainly matches the extremes:
<ul><li> Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il both are known to have had children by multiple women. Il-sung at least has the excuse that his first wife died during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> fighting the Japanese, but Jong-il was known to be a playboy who got into relationships his father disapproved. He was widely suspected of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slaves</a> and could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatheHerAndBringHerToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatheHerAndBringHerToMe">essentially summon any woman who caught his eye</a>. One of those women, the mother of current leader Kim Jong-un, was born in Japan and was part-Japanese, a fact which is a state secret in North Korea because of how much they <em>particularly</em> hate the Japanese.
</li><li> Kim Jong-il's succession wasn't entirely clear-cut. His original pick was his oldest son Kim Jong-nam, but Jong-nam turned out to be a bit more of a bleeding heart than Jong-il liked, and he eventually fell out of favour with his father in 2000 when he was caught using a fake passport to enter Japan so he could go to Tokyo Disneyland. Jong-nam eventually went into effective exile in Macau, while the succession filtered to Kim Jong-un, at that time a teenager who was a complete unknown. When Jong-il died in 2011, Jong-un became the leader and made a name for himself by assassinating everyone he perceived as a threat (including his own uncle, by some reports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">with an anti-aircraft gun</a>), and in 2017 he had his own half-brother Jong-nam assassinated in broad daylight at the airport in Kuala Lumpur using VX nerve agent. Communism may have eliminated royalty, but it does nothing to court intrigues.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia">Saudi Arabia</a> is run by the House of Saud. It's one of the few countries named after a guy, said guy being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud">Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud</a>. Every king of Saudi Arabia since then has been one of Abdul Aziz's many many sons, reflecting the country's peculiar succession laws that more or less require going through all the sons before going to the grandsons. The last few kings have all been increasingly aging and haven't lasted that long, which is why they agreed in 2017 on one of Abdul Aziz's grandsons, Mohammad bin Salman (popularly known as "MBS"), to be the new heir. The Saudi monarchy has had a reputation for being startlingly backwards and promoting religious extremism &mdash; the country was long known for its frequent public executions for trivial offenses, its <em>mutaween</em> or religious police, and its bizarre religious prohibitions &mdash; women famously weren't allowed to <em>drive</em>. All of Abdul Aziz's sons had their own levels of extremism, leading to factionalism among them &mdash; for instance, in 1975, King Faisal was assassinated by his own half-nephew (ostensibly for being too progressive &mdash; this four years before a group of extremists invaded the Grand Mosque itself seeking to overthrow the House of Saud for <em>still</em> being too progressive). MBS, for his part, was widely lauded as the young, progressive world leader who would bring Saudi Arabia into the 21st century &mdash; he championed legislation that allowed women to drive, for instance. But then he turned around and arrested and tortured most of his rivals in an "anti-corruption" campaign<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15f3n8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15f3n8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15f3n8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They were all probably guilty as hell &mdash; the boundaries between "state assets" and "royal family's personal bank account" are pretty blurry &mdash; but MBS was clearly being selective in whom he chose to pursue</span>, imprisoned women's rights activists, engaged in an ethnic cleansing campaign in Yemen, and was likely responsible for the gruesome murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, so it's likely he's not going to be much of a change. But hey, oil money buys you a lot in this world.
</li><li> Ibn Khaldun, in talking about North African bedouins, made the observation that basically every monarchy is dooned to go through this, especially when they engage in conquest. The first generation is tribal and not quite civilised, but also tough and a natural leader. The second generation can see what made the first great, but growing up in a castle lacks a little perspective. The third generation goes soft, and subsequent generations get softer and softer until someone else sees an opportunity for conquest and takes over. He had the experience of being close enough to the Islamic dynasties of Spain, which were an excellent example of this paradigm, but it's a startlingly appropriate observation &mdash; practically every great dynasty was essentially started by a rough hick whose descendants became more and more educated.
</li><li> Some Biblical scholars believe that <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul">King Saul<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> may have been schizophrenic. He shows a jealous obsession with his eventual successor <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingDavid">King David</a> and tries to kill him several times, and he throws a spear at his own son <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_(1_Samuel)">Jonathan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for merely asking why his best friend David had to die (1 Samuel 20:30). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The text</a> also suggests that he had severe migraine headaches, which can cause memory loss and very irrational behaviour &mdash; it especially dovetails nicely with the idea that his doctors prescribed music to help him relax (1 Samuel 16:23), which is why David was brought there, and ancient Israel would have seen the headaches as a sign of their king's prophetic power rather than a medical condition.
