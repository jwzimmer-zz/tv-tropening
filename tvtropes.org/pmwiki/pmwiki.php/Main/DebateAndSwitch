<p>A work of fiction sets up a moral dilemma or other painful choice, then finds a way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">resolve it without actually addressing the issue it raised</a>. Say, Alice is seriously ill and Bob is considering robbing a local pharmacy to get the medicine she desperately needs. Then he wins the money he needs in the lottery, meaning that he (and the writers) never have to come down on the question of whether theft is acceptable for a good cause.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is used for a number of reasons. It allows the show to resolve the tension without
</p><ol><li>giving an unrealistically clear-cut or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> solution to an ambiguous problem, or
</li><li>alienating the half of the audience who would disapprove of the resolution if the characters did make the hard choice.
</li></ol>It avoids having to anything objectionable (who wants to be on record saying that theft might be okay if you're in dire straits?) And it lets creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">flex their godlike muscles</a>: it's their story, and they don't have to write the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> that would almost certainly result for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Alice and Bob.
<p>Expect this in works invoking ethnicity and/or gender tropes in ways that might otherwise be blatantly liable to charges of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, e.g. relating to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast">Mars-and-Venus Gender Contrast</a>. Usually, a Debate and Switch is pulled in one of the following ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The antagonist is originally set up as doing something that falls in the moral (and legal) gray area, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">jumps off the slippery slope</a> or is revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">Straw Hypocrite</a>.
</li><li> Related to the above, if one party turns out to be partnered with or working for any kind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainByDefault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainByDefault">Villain by Default</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> The evidence points to the antagonist having committed a crime over the issue under discussion, then new evidence is uncovered that shows that the motive was actually more clear-cut.
</li><li> The protagonists are put into the morally gray situation, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>.
</li><li> The protagonists are put into the morally gray situation, then another consideration makes it much more black-and-white. The decision is made on that consideration, with the original considerations becoming moot. No Third Option necessary, just a Second Question.
</li><li> Before a decision can be made, outside events render it moot, such as a suspect dying in an accident while the antagonists are debating their guilt.
</li><li> Someone on either side is revealed to be lying about something (motive, true conditions, consequences, etc.), and lying automatically makes them the loser.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The argument over culpability turns out to be moot, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">suspect</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">proven to actually be innocent</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, one of the driving points of the narrative is whether or not the eponymous character would use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Shikon no Tama</a> to turn into a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> (or maybe even a full human.) The point is moot since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kagome destroys the Jewel at the end of the manga. Any wish would be 'wrong'</span>. Then again, quite a bit of emphasis is put on the fact that Kagome loves him just as who he is, making it ultimately a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>" aesop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> made a major plot point being the villain's plan to lock everyone in the world into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">their own personal dream world that would give them their every desire</a>. Whether or not this would ultimately be a good thing for a world that raises child soldiers is glossed over in favor of discussing how villainous the means of the people trying to set it off are using. Later on it's also added that the plan also slowly turns people into empty zombies, making the initial debate further removed by having the dream world be fatal. Likewise, once people are released their reactions are glossed over and no one expresses any interest at all over their dream worlds despite how easily traumatic it would be for many of them to see lost loved ones again thinking they were real. And then even <em>that</em> is rendered moot when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out the whole thing is being manipulated to resurrect a villain whose goals are much less defensible.</span>
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDaughterOfTwentyFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDaughterOfTwentyFaces">The Daughter of Twenty Faces</a></em> deals with how the protagonists are supposed to be sympathetic when they're major thieves. The main character befriends a lonely little girl, who happens to be the daughter of the head of security for a museum holding the object the protagonists want to steal. In doing so, she learns how to sneak past the security guards and that *<em>Gasp</em>* stealing a priceless object from the museum could cause big trouble for the kindly security chief and his innocent daughter. Chiko's huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">betrayal of her new friend</a> is softened by the revelation that the little girl was actually evil at the end of the episode, and everything she said about her father was probably a lie.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic">of course.</a> Is it right to stop <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chao Lingshen</span>, who is obviously not a bad person and seems to have a good motive? Negi spends so much time worrying about it that his students basically just tell him to shut up after a while, because if it was so important she ought to just <em>tell</em> him. Eventually, they decide it doesn't matter what they're doing is right or wrong, they just don't want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">to be turned into ermines</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chao</span> hasn't convinced them otherwise. Some fans think it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">intentional</a> in order to set Negi up for Fate, who also seems to have a good goal and bad methods. He notably worries much less about it, anyway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Which may have been why Chao set up the moral dilemma in the first place</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> does this, although it must be noted that the moral ambiguities it toys with have been debated for centuries and probably will continue to be debated for centuries after: Is all life equal? Do some people deserve to die? Is it right to kill a killer? Is evil irredeemable?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TwinPrincessOfWonderPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TwinPrincessOfWonderPlanet">Twin Princess of Wonder Planet</a></em>: Fine and Rein find out that Mirlo is in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with a rather undesirable dimwit, and are out to break it up. Reviewer Al1701 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQ4wqYiE9Y">pointed out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that this action seems short-sighted since the deal for the marriage is in exchange for dimwit's father repairing the Waterdrop Kingdom's cloudmaker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That is, until the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> turns out to be a big ruse by the Moon Kingdom chancellor. Doesn't stop this from being one of the best eps of the whole series.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman&#12290;</a></em>, several older and less successful mangakas start submitting works for Jump, prompting a debate between Takagi and Mashiro over whether they should be given a chance for a comeback; Takagi doesn't think so, while Mashiro, whose uncle kept trying to get a series even after his contract was canceled, strongly disagrees, and Nizuma believes that writers should not be treated as disposable. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nanamine is using these mangakas as his way to try a second time with an improved version of his "system"</span>. In the end, though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azuma, one of the manga artists Nanamine had used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">and then discarded</a> succeeds on his own</span>, perhaps making this a subversion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> poses the question: does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">utopia justify the means</a> if you plan on ending all crime by killing all criminals? Said question is rendered moot by the fact that the perpetrator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Light Yagami, goes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">into a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">god complex</a> who kills all who oppose him. This is also present in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">the way</a> someone responds to Light trying to justify his actions.
<ul><li> The moment when Light as Kira goes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> is when he kills a detective on TV who says that while he understands Kira's motive, it's evil to just kill people who are in prison or facing trial because it goes against established laws and systems. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That's when Kira realizes that he enjoys killing people, and starts gaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> for every murder he witnesses. While that detective was a decoy, the subsequent round of Japanese cops and FBI agents who are murdered are real law enforcement. The minute the reader learns that Light has committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">This Is Unforgivable!</a> is not when he murders Naomi Misora, but that he reveals himself to her right before her fate to kill herself and hide her body so no one finds it kicks in, forcing her to walk away and complete the order he wrote in the notebook. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a> is never sportsmanlike when you've already won</span>.
</li><li> A lot of the morality debate is cut from the anime, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final debate between Light and Near</span> is cut down to its bare minimum, including Light expressing his belief that he's not only getting rid of the criminals, but creating a society where people are free to do good. Near similarly believes that Kira is forcing his own views onto others under threat of death, "neither peaceful nor just," and asks everyone else what they think about it, to which they respond with tacit approval.
</li><li> There is considerably more examination of the ramifications of Kira's new world order in the manga. However, while the authors ultimately leave it up to the reader to decide whether <em>Kira</em> is morally justified or not, they note that <em>Light</em> was corrupted by having the power to kill at will and was no longer actually working toward his professed ideals.
</li><li> The live-action movies also have this issue but they at least address the grey area of the situation. Light to the bitter end declares that he is creating a safer place because human justice systems cannot protect the people who serve and maintain it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His father agrees when L proves that Light is Kira and the latter goes on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a>; human justice systems <em>are</em> imperfect because the people who create them are flawed. But he says regardless, that killing people who commit wrongs is not the solution and Light is just a self-serving bully that went for a blunt solution. Sequels would reveal that while Light died and L burned the notebooks before he succumbed to a heart attack, other people decided to take Light's place when given a notebook or an opportunity to utilize them</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Death Note: How To Read</a></em>, the authors explain that this trope is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel">Necessary Weasel</a> because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">target demographic</a>.

</li><li> One of the main messages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway">Smile Down The Runway</a></em> is how you must never compromise on your dreams/passions. At one point, Ikuto runs into financial troubles due to his mother's illness and is given the choice to back down as a fashion designer in an upcoming fashion event and work as a patterner for a more experienced designer instead (thus compromising his dream), or convince a friend (who was being scouted as a model) to quit being a fashion designer (thus compromising <em>her</em> dream). Then another friend's father (the owner of a modeling agency) offers to buy his designs, which quickly resolves his financial issues without him needing to sacrifice his or his friend's dream.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> The first part of season two has this. The twins Ali and En come to Earth with their mother, the Doom Tree. They know the tree is dying but don't know how to save her, and both of them grow sicker as the Doom Tree weakens. Ali determines they need to steal human energy to survive, even as he and his sister go for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a> while posing as huamns and start falling for their classmates.

When the Senshi learn about the full situation in the season finale, they're sympathetic and try to talk them down since an untransformed Usagi and Mamoru are in the crossfire. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, Sailor Moon allows the Doom Tree to talk wtih her powers, and the tree reveals the human energy was actually poisoning it and it needed love. Ali goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> as he holds a prone En, who took a deadly blow for him. Sailor Moon heals the tree with Moon Princess Halation and all of her love, which allows it and En to revive. Ali and En apologize to the Senshi, thanking Sailor Moon and Mamoru for their kindness. They decide to leave Earth with what they know about love and start a new life. The Senshi wish them luck</span>.
</li><li> <em>S</em> has this in the first part as well. The Outers know that removing a pure heart from someone will kill them, but they are willing to if the Heart is a Talisman because, as Sailor Uranus pragmatically points out, if they don't then the Witches Five definitely <em>will</em> . At least the Senshi can use the Talismans that emerge to stop the Holy Grail from being used for evil. Meanwhile the Senshi, especially Usagi, protest that it's not worth sacrificing an innocent person who may not know they're holding a Talisman; Usagi would sacrifice her heart to protect Mamoru or her friends, but it shouldn't be on a normal person to make that choice. Uranus even agrees privately, as shown when she and Neptune were relieved that Ami didn't carry a Talisman within her body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The point becomes moot when it turns out Uranus and Neptune have two of the Talismans; though Uranus commits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide">Heroic Suicide</a> and tells Sailor Moon it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllUpToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllUpToYou">All Up to You</a> to summon the Grail, Usagi doing so revives both Uranus and Neptune. Pluto reveals that the orb on her staff is her Talisman, and lets Usagi use it, showing no ill effects</span>. This situation ends up repeating when they realize that Chibi-Usa's new friend is the incarnation for Sailor Saturn. The Outers say that Saturn will end the world if she awakens, while Usagi points out they can't murder an innocent girl in cold blood because of something they <em>might</em> do. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Senshi ended up missing the mark that Saturn needed to awaken to stop <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MIstress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MIstress">M Istress</a> 9 and Pharaoh 90 and were acting on poor information</span>.

Public hysteria ensues, and super heroes are placed in a difficult dilemma: with uncontrolled super-hero actions banned, heroes must sign the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Super Registration Act</a> and work for the government, or be hunted down by all the government forces (including the superheroes that signed for it). The registration side won, and things stayed that way for a time. Well, and once the thing has lasted long enough, how do we return things to the way they always were? Easy: put a supervillain on top of the registration side, put all superheroes on the other side, and turn a topic of (allegedly) grey and gray morality <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rhyx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0rhyx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rhyx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">during the event itself the Pro-Registration side crossed too many lines throughout the different tie-in books to remain in the gray side of morality</span> into a topic of black and white morality.
</li><li> Similarly, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Mutant Registration Acts</a> are never given an actual debate. It's sometimes acknowledged that, hey, these are people with the power to level mountains just by opening their eyes and reasonable people might want some means of protection from the bad ones, but the Act is nearly always being pushed by bigots who are using it as the first step in wiping out mutantkind. Even when the promoter is <em>not</em> such a bigot, the specter of such information still being used <em>by</em> bigots to facilitate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> remains omnipresent. The very first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> plotline, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast">Days of Future Past</a></em>, revolves around the dark world created by enforcing mutant registration, where mutants are forcibly marked and herded into concentration camps, or even exterminated altogether. Animated depictions usually take away the moral ambiguity by portraying such a world as mostly being the fault of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">defective programming</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobot">Sentinels</a> humans use to enforce the registration laws.
<ul><li> The same usually happen whenever someone comes up with a mutant cure. The anti-cure side will usually argue that mutation is part of who you are and there is nothing to cure and will be presented as being right in this opinion, forgetting that the comic has frequently depicted people who would like to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">get rid of their powers</a>, often with very good reason, because their uncontrollable powers cause them constant suffering and/or endanger anybody near them. Then the point is rendered moot because the one behind the cure (or someone else who get a hold of it) had malevolent intentions, was planning to <em>cure</em> all mutants regardless of whether or not they want it, or there is some nasty side-effect.

And just to make sure Magneto has a firm grip on the villain ball, his "process" is powered by an unwilling Rogue, because he's not willing to sacrifice his own life for the cause when he can sacrifice somebody else's instead</span>.
</li><li> The sequels avoid the issue altogether by making him progressively more villainous. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>, he does try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a> (apparently unwilling to pass up the opportunity after the other villain nearly managed to Kill All Mutants), and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></em> he even sees his fellow mutants as expendable pawns.
</li><li> In the third movie, this is also done with the debate about using the mutant "cure" versus protesting it. Plenty of mutants are shown benefiting from the cure, while just as many find the idea insulting. There are allies of the X-men who speak in favor of it and there are mutants opposed to it who form nice, organized meetings to figure out how to get their views heard. And then Magneto shows up and the rest of the movie has him and his violent followers as the main mutants protesting the cure. Also, he destroys the facility producing the cure, and the mutant behind it is taken away. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the very least, Rogue gets the cure, and Wolverine tells her to get it for herself, not for her boyfriend. She looks truly happy for the first time ever when showing Bobby she can kiss him without draining his powers or life force.

In regards to the latter, Dennis bemoans the practice of hiring lower-skilled people on the basis of immutable characteristics like skin color, especially in regards to high-risk professions such as his job as a fireman. However, he follows this up with a bunch of racist remarks directed at Derek's black teacher, showing that Dennis is arguing in bad faith without addressing the merit of the argument itself.

A dramatic example is when Tim is dating Mary and suddenly gets a chance to spend the night with an old crush. If he were to succumb to temptation, he could go back in time and undo it, but still remember the entire experience. Would that be ethical? Would it still constitute infidelity? And what does that say about all his other uses of time travel? When faced with that issue, he realizes he doesn't <em>want</em> to sleep with anyone except Mary, and runs home to propose to her.

</li><li> This happens in <em>Mercy</em>. The whole thing is about the ethical issues of euthanasia and mercy killing, and it turns out that... oh, wait, it doesn't. Not only do we not get an overall view on euthanasia, we don't even get to find out the views of 90% of the <em>characters</em>. It's the kind of 'debate' where people stand around chatting and occasionally eat a biscuit.

He's also a Hitler-esque tyrant who would make everyone's lives worse if he actually won, so it's up to the heroes to stop him and let oppression continue. Apparently, the only reason it even comes up is so the villain's followers can be portrayed as misguided rather than evil.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDispossessed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDispossessed">The Dispossessed</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> can be read as a dramatized debate over the question of whether anarchism, represented by the "Odonian" philosophy practised on the planet Anarres, or liberal democratic capitalism, represented by the nation of A-Io on Anarres' sister-planet Urras, is better. Though the author clearly prefers anarchism, for most of the book the question is dealt with subtly, with the failings of Anarresti society and the successes of the society of A-Io both being shown. Then, practically out of the blue, A-Io massacres peaceful protesters by the thousand. Well, <em>duh</em>, Anarresti anarchism is better than <em>that</em>. The whole philosophical debate is tossed aside and replaced by Baddies Are Bad. In an interesting case, the A-Io's actions are understandable, though not justified - they remember what the last strike led to, and they are all out of moons to bribe dissidents with. It's also probably worth noting that, while massacres of striking workers weren't common in 1970s America, they were common in America at the turn of the century, so this could also simply be a case of Anachronism Stew, but it seems probable that A-Io is meant to represent an older US, as the US of the 1970s certainly also did not prohibit women from universities, for example-much the opposite.

Yet, she never has to face this dilemma. She <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> only ever kills Careers, who are treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a></span>, and even none of these kills are calculated or cold-blooded. Katniss drops the tracker-jackers on the Careers, because they are hunting her, which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ends up killing Glimmer. She shoots Marvel, but as a quick reflex after Marvel kills Rue, and later kills Cato as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>.</span> Katniss worries about having to kill Rue, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but Marvel does this for her,</span> Foxface, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but then Foxface <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">mistakenly eats the nightlock berries</a></span>, and Thresh after he saves Katniss&#146; live <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but then Cato kills Thresh</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> Season 4: It's an interesting question whether the heroes should defeat Jasmine, who brought peace to the world at the cost of humanity's free will. The revelation that she eats people makes the debate moot. However, it is clearly still viewed as, at best, an ambiguous choice. As Jasmine herself pointed out, she was killing thousands to save billions, and the opening of the Season finale shows the characters themselves are pretty torn over it.

<ul><li> The series can usually be counted on to examine social problems at some length, yet fell into this trap in Season 4.5. In light of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">recent discoveries</a> the policies of the Adama/Roslin administration are brought into question &mdash; the two had fielded an "ends justifies the means" approach to getting to Earth, especially Roslin who followed her visions on blind faith. Even in the midst of the latest scandal, Roslin is irresponsibly letting the government get out of control without allowing another leader to step into power, and Adama is considering allowing the Cylons &mdash; the same Cylons that nuked the 12 Colonies and then tormented the population of New Caprica for a year &mdash; <em>citizenship</em> into the Colonial Fleet. While Adama may have justification for contemplating this move, the show is right to suggest it, as well as Roslin's childish behavior, deserves to be re-evaluated with care ... however, when Adama and Roslin's opposition turns out to be led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Felix Gaeta</a> and Tom Zarek, who summarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">attempt to kill many of our beloved characters</a> and succeed at killing numerous secondaries, the writers opt for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">different approach</a>. It seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">getting our protagonists into tough spots</a> was not on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">the agenda</a>, after all.
</li><li> There's a recurring theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>, about whether the Cylons are really "alive" and had souls. But according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica">Caprica</a></em>, the Cylons originated when a human's memories and personality are coded into a digital avatar. So basically, the skinjob Cylons have bodies molecularly indistinguishable from humans, and their minds are essentially human minds, and since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica">Caprica</a></em> doesn't end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">with a massive wave of amnesia</a>, the BSG characters should know this from history class. So they are as human as anyone else. Why the hell are even they considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">robots</a> by any criteria except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Karel Capek's?</a>
</li><li> That one seems to be more a case of deliberately dehumanizing them, i.e. refusing to acknowledge Cylons are or could be people (even <em>bad</em> people). It's hardly surprising given the wars both sides fought, and the Cylons having an artificial origin just made it easier.

<ul><li> One prominent example occurs during the first season, when a woman is on trial for bombing an abortion clinic. The moral issues of abortion are debated, even going so far as to polarize the main cast members (and, it's implied, the jury), but then the ADA pulls the rug out during cross-examination by pointing out that, by killing a pregnant woman, the bomber <em>also</em> murdered her unborn child. Cue one guilty verdict.
</li><li> Subverted when a man kills the insurance executive who vetoed an extremely expensive treatment for his terminally-ill daughter. During the trial, the insurance company reverses its position, putting her on the medication and giving strong credibility to the justification that the murder saved his daughter's life. But the judge refuses to allow the jury to hear about this, insisting the trial should be about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">an eye for an eye</a>. It ended on a "hopelessly deadlocked" hung jury, and it's strongly implied the DAs aren't going to bother trying again.
</li><li> "Scrambled": a woman is charged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">Felony Murder</a> after she hires an ex-cop to break into a fertility clinic and destroy her eggs and he kills a worker who walked in on him. The case hinges on whether or not one's own eggs can be legally the property of someone else, for the purposes of establishing the predicate felony. Except during the break-in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the cop destroyed another couple's eggs too, but they didn't initially come forward to report the 'loss' for other reasons.</span>
</li><li> Happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">three times</a> in "Progeny", another abortion episode. The killer uses the "preservation of life" justification of killing the abortion doctor to save a woman's unborn fetus. McCoy first points out that since the doctor's intended patient was really the killer's partner and her scheduled abortion was a ruse to lure the doctor out that her fetus was never in jeopardy. He then digs up evidence the defendant's motive was revenge against abortion doctors after he failed to prevent the woman carrying his child from getting an abortion. The defendant's spiritual advisor, a pro-life advocate who insists on making a jury debate the value of the "preservation of life" argument, claims he was the defendant's co-conspirator, having provided the gun and transportation for him to kill the doctor. On the stand, he claims the justification defense but McCoy asks him why, if he believes its morally right to kill abortion doctors, did he not just pull the trigger himself instead of giving the gun to the killer? The answer was that no matter how much he decried abortion, he still knew it was wrong to kill anyone, thus he did not believe in his own defense.

</li><li> A young woman with Down Syndrome is raped and impregnated, but wants to keep the baby. Her elderly mother, however, wants to abort, feeling she won't be around long enough to provide for both her daughter and grandchild. The detectives are caught up in the family drama as they search for the rapist... and eventually they do find him, and it turns out he's filthy rich. As such, the police decide to plea bargain him in exchange for lifetime child support, so everyone's happy.
<ul><li> In the same episode, it isn't immediately clear that there <em>was</em> a rape; initially, it appears that the baby may have been fathered by the girl's boyfriend, raising some fairly complex questions about whether or not the woman is capable of giving meaningful consent. All of which goes out the window when both parties insist they never had sex, and it's solidified when detectives discover that it was somebody else who had blatantly taken advantage of her naivete to manipulate her into sex, making it a clear-cut case of rape.

<ul><li> The episode "Dear Doctor", the switch was an even <em>bigger</em> moral decision. Initially it's about whether to interfere in the natural arrangement of a pre-warp society (a stone-age species is kept in benign slavery by a more advanced one), but then it suddenly turns out that the disease that's been spreading among the dominant species (and for which the crew was helping to find a cure) is a "natural development" of their evolution (which may well "solve" the problem of the stone-age species' subjugation by killing their caretakers). So naturally, the crew decide to give them relief of the symptoms rather than a cure, in a proto-development of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Prime Directive</a> (its most appalling application in the entire history of the series, which is ironic as it was intended as a justification for it). And then people wondered why the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise took a breather. <br><br>This was actually the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>; in the original script Phlox refused a direct order from Archer to give the species in question the cure he had developed.

Unfortunately this had the opposite effect as viewers began calling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>.
</li><li> A better usage was in the episode "Affliction" in which Phlox and the Klingon Doctor Antaak have been tasked with finding a cure for the Klingon Augment Virus which is threatening to wipe out the entire Klingon Empire. Dismayed to see Antaak preparing to euthanize one of the infected test subjects with a lethal injection, Phlox interrupts him and an argument breaks out between them as Antaak insists that giving one's life to save millions is a most honorable way for a Klingon to die while Phlox contends that such a killing is ethically unthinkable. While they're arguing, their boss General K'Vagh pulls his disruptor, calmly shoots the victim, and tells them "Proceed."

The titular character is a symbiont, which is implanted in a humanoid host, and shares experiences and personality. When one host dies, the symbiont is passed onto another, retaining its old memories. The previous host, Curzon, is accused of a crime, and the victim's families want the new host, Jadzia, to be tried and punished for them. The symbiont can't be removed without killing Jadzia, so the episode wrestles with a complex legal and philosophical question of whether the symbiont in its current host is sufficiently the same person as to be culpable for a crime that took place in a different life. Before any resolution is reached, the question is rendered moot by proving that Curzon wasn't guilty of the crime in the first place (and had hidden his alibi because he'd been with his best friend's wife).

<ul><li> In "Scientific Method", it is revealed that the crew have been the subjects of medical experiments by an alien species (a thinly-veiled allusion to animal testing). Janeway finally manages to get the experiments aborted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">flying Voyager into a pulsar, which is stated to be nearly-certain death, which scares the aliens off and destroys one of their ships that doesn't get away in time. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Voyager survives</a>. The reason this is this trope is that Janeway is only acting that way <em>because</em> of the experiments of the aliens</span>.
</li><li> The Seska arc introduces a wildly complicated question when Seska reveals that she forcibly stole Chakotay's DNA and impregnanted herself with it, and later begs for his help when she and his son are in danger. How he's supposed to respond to that is agonizingly difficult. To the show's credit, they do spend a good deal of time dealing with these questions (Chakotay decides to try and get custody and raise him after the spirit quest version of his father makes the observation that the boy is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>), but they're ultimately rendered moot when it turns out that the child isn't actually Chakotay's after all.

</li><li> In "Shattered," <em>Voyager</em> is split into 37 different timeframes. Chakotay, the only one originating from the proper timeframe, enlists the help of a Janeway from before <em>Voyager</em> was launched into the Delta Quadrant, injecting her with a special chroniton-infused serum so that she can exist in the other timeframes. Along the way, she begins to learn about all of the crazy stuff that's happened to <em>Voyager</em> throughout its run in the Delta Quadrant and blames herself for it. She wants to modify Chakotay's plan to fix things so that all of <em>Voyager</em> is back in the proper timeframe so that it is instead in <em>her</em> timeframe, and thus she can make it so that it never goes into the Delta Quadrant. Chakotay tells her that she's not seeing the big picture - all of the families and relationsships that have formed on <em>Voyager</em> and how everyone's grown. He also says that it's presumptuous of her to think that she has the right to change everyone's future. Yet, in the series finale "Endgame," this is exactly what happens. <em>Admiral</em> Janeway returns from the future with a plan to get <em>Voyager</em> home. There's maybe about two minutes of hand-wringing about the ethics of this at most, with most of the rest of the story spent on the ironing-out and execution of the plan, the upshot being that it works out exactly as intended and <em>Voyager</em> gets home nearly 16 years before it did in Admiral Janeway's timeline.

As said demon is also causing the town of Redcliffe to be constantly attacked by the undead, this obviously cannot continue. You are given multiple options, most of which have a very negative downside (make a deal with the demon, kill Conner, or use Conner's mother Isolde in a blood ritual that will cleanse Conner of the demon but kill her (with her consent). None of these options are great, and 2 of them end with Alistair giving you a MASSIVE chewing out (with big loss of approval) and the third causes Conner to be possessed again by the demon sometime down the line. However, there's a final option that makes all the above irrelevant. You can simply leave and go get help from the near by Mage's Circle, who will come with skilled mages/templars and lyrium, allowing them to purge Conner of the demon with no loss of life. Conner will be required to go live at the Circle for the rest of his life, but it's generally the best option he has available with Ferelden's situation. And there isn't even any time limit if you take this option, you can put off going to the tower for a long while and the Redcliffe situation won't change one bit.

</li><li> Until the aversion comes at the end, however, it's played straight when it comes to the complaints of the Mages. Their complaints are never actually seriously addressed, because most of their arguments are "disqualified" for extenuating reasons. Anders, their primary advocate, is possessed by Justice and is portrayed as irrational, with even freedom advocate Isabela mostly brushing him off, so players can conveniently write him off and ignore anything he says as the words of a crazy abomination. The strongest argument the Mages have, that the Templars treat all Mages the same way and are willing to punish the innocent along with the guilty, is brushed off by Fenris "shifting the burden of proof", and almost every Mage you meet is an insane blood mage trying to kill you. Well, at least pro-Mage players can have their points addressed with Merrill... oh wait, she conveniently turns out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accidentally unleash a Pride Demon on her clan in Act 3.

Leandra is furious that Gamlen didn't tell her he lost the family fortune, then used her new family's distress to sell her kids into indentured servitude to pay off his debts. Gamlen counters that she <em>chose</em> to leave the family fortune behind years ago, left Gamlen to take care of everything, turned up decades later only when she needed something, and is acting entitled and ungrateful for the help Gamlen <em>could</em> offer her. It raises interesting questions of how much Gamlen really owes her and how appreciative Leandra should be. Then Hawke finds out that Leandra's parents actually left her everything and Gamlen stole her inheritance, rendering his side of the argument completely moot.

Near the end of the game, the characters find a workaround to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycle</a>, but it will still cause the deaths of <em>two</em> of the major protagonists. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that this was done intentionally, in order to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s growth from being selfish to selfless. However, in the sequel, a similar situation comes up and a character offers to sacrifice himself in order to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of X-2. Yuna vehemently opposes this idea, stating that she is sick of watching friends die or fade away, and that she does not want to fight battles where "we have to lose in order to win." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Furthermore, the aforementioned sacrificed hero gains a chance to be reborn in this game, should the player meet certain requirements, providing no resolution to the overall debate.</span>
</li><li> Done deliberately and with severe repercussions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>. In the second game, Tali's loyalty mission has you defending her from a charge of treason. In the course of seeking evidence of her innocence, you find a recording revealing that her father was responsible for the crimes she's charged with. She asks you not to use the evidence (which will render her father the worst criminal in quarian history), even though it means permanent exile from her people. You can either use it, withhold it and see her exiled from the Migrant Fleet, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> (with enough Paragon/Renegade) and shame the Admirality Board into backing down. If you <em>don't</em> take the third option, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it becomes far more difficult to make peace between the quarians and the geth, because you'll have given the warmongers on the board evidence to back their position, and removed the possibility of Tali acting as a voice of reason</span>.
<ul><li> The geth/quarian conflict that occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> definitely plays out this way. Towards the end, you're forced to choose between one side or the other, with the side you don't pick <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being completely and utterly destroyed, essentially leading that race to extinction</span>. However, depending on your choices in the previous game and during the Rannoch arc in this one, you may get to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> where both races survive and even make long-term peace. There's a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> involved in this, but generally if you keep picking options throughout the series that promote the belief that there can be peace between the two races, it's not too hard to unlock.

By the end of the game, it is simply assumed by the core cast that all Pokemon are content to be raised by their trainers, and the sole unambiguously heroic member of the organization is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, conveniently allowing the series to avoid bringing the issue up again.

Interestingly, both sides reference the Dark War, and both have good reasons for their chosen outcome. Kokonoe's is purely technical: whereas Bloodedge's sacrifice froze the Beast for one year, use of the Lynchpin could have suspended it for three to five, giving more time to better articulate an effective armed response against it. Ragna's argument is from an emotional standpoint: the whole reason Nine worked so hard on making the Nox Nyctores was because she was trying to get out of sacrificing Celica in the first place, and if Celica had gotten sacrificed, she would have been consigned to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>, with Nine crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> as a result. The argument ends by intervention from Rachel, who reveals that the Nox Nyctores Houyoku: Rettenjo was made as a workaround to fire the Lynchpin, and that it had been loaded recently... with former Imperator Tenjo's soul. This allows both sides to get what they want in the end: Kokonoe gets to fire the Lynchpin to impair Imperator Izanami's operations, and the gang get to keep Celica for the rest of her natural existence... or as natural as a chronophantasma gets, anyway. Another problem related to the debate &mdash; that Celica's chronophantasma was evoked for this inevitable endgame &mdash; is never addressed.</span>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, new character Kasumi Yoshizawa brings up a decent counter-argument to the actions of the Phantom Thieves while still remaining sympathetic: by reforming society through changing the hearts of corrupt adults, they're robbing victims of the chance to stand up for themselves and solve their own problems. These points hit even harder during the Okumura arc, where the Phantom Thieves' engineered popularity has caused the public to blindly trust them to solve <em>all</em> society's problems, while they sit back and do nothing. Shortly after this arc, Kasumi accidentally wanders into the Metaverse and awakens to her Persona in front of Joker and Morgana, and from that point on she's fully on-board with the Thieves and their methods, and her initial argument is never mentioned again. And revelations in the 3rd semester make it questionable whether she ever held those views to begin with, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the "Kasumi" who espoused them was actually her sister Sumire brainwashed into thinking she was Kasumi</span>. On the other hand, the endgame ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">involves the Phantom Thieves giving up their power to erase the Metaverse, as well as defeating Maruki to bring the world back to normal, in the hopes that the public's hearts will change and hold Shido accountable for his crimes</span>, so perhaps the story comes down on Kasumi's side in the end.

Her main motivation is to kill her brother-in-law, Artorius, for selfish revenge, while Artorius has the goal of ending the menace of Daemonblight, which causes people to turn into bloodthirsty monsters seemingly at random. Then it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daemonblight is actually caused by Malevolence, strong negative emotions</span> and that if Artorius succeeds in his plans, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daemonblight will be stopped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSilence">erasing everyone's free wills and forcing them to act according to "order"</a>, which will prevent them from creating Malevolence and Daemons, but will also end creativity and culture, and cause the deaths of several innocent and mostly-innocent people (people who have committed crimes in the past will have their feelings of guilt amplified until they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>, people who commit crimes out of necessity are executed, and the elderly are either used as live bait for the remaining Daemons or willingly go into exile until they starve to death).

<ul><li> In the second case, Maya is on trial for murdering a doctor while channeling a spirit with a grudge against the latter. In a world where spirit channeling is very much confirmed to be real, this raises interesting questions on whether the channeler can really be held responsible for their actions while under the control of a supernatural entity and even if the latter can even be punished for their actions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course Maya is actually being framed by a normal person who can be convicted and sent to jail like everyone else</span>.

<ul><li> The first season sets up a really interesting question about the premise of the setting, only to ultimately result in this. We're introduced to the Equalists, a group of non-bender <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">revolutionaries</a> who feel oppressed by the superpowered benders (and we're shown that powers are used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">in practical contexts</a> as well as combat, so benders would make it hard for non-benders to get jobs as much as it makes them easy targets). Korra doesn't do much to counter their beliefs at first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">being rude, arrogant, and horribly insensitive to them</a> about how awesome bending is, then going on to proudly star in a major sport that requires you to be a bender. While the Equalists resort to greater and greater forms of domestic terrorism, the attitudes of the bender main characters (and bender politicians) only make it easier to understand why the Equalists are so upset. So how is this resolved? By revealing that the Equalists are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> secretly led by a bender</span>. While his motives are actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pretty honest after all</span>, his defeat is still treated as a resolution to the problem, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his true identity as not just a bender, but a <em>bloodbender</em> (bloodbenders can turn anyone into a puppet or kill them outright, and even block the bending of others), only showed how right he and the Equalists were to feel at the mercy of the dangerously powerful benders</span>. The most attention this is ever given is that a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">non-bender president</span> is installed off-screen between seasons. What certainly doesn't help is that the only non-bender main character is non-powered in much the way that Batman is (in other words, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have a massive fortune and one-of-a-kind brilliant mind that allows them to compensate for a lack of superpowers in a way that cannot be easily imitated</span>).
</li><li> Second season had more minor versions of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unalaq</span> wanted a balance between the human and spirit realms, which Korra would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually let happen anyway</span>, but since his methods involved deception, manufactured civil wars, and unleashing an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">avatar of chaos</span>, little actual debate was had on the matter. Similarly, Vaatu's nature called into debate the methods Korra usually used to solve her problems (namely, force), by being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a being made from and empowered by concepts like aggression and violence (which gave Avatar Wan no other option other than to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">seal it away</a>)</span>. So, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being brought low</span>, Korra has a spiritual journey to find a way to beat him... which ends up just being to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beat him into submission like every other villain</span>.
</li><li> Third season has the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red Lotus</span>, a group of anarchists who have some legitimate concerns with the various leaders of the world. In fact, the one leader they manage to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">assassinate</span> is an Orwellian tyrant. The fact that they're extremists (to the point where they didn't even think about the consequences of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a power vacuum</span>) allows the characters to mostly ignore even the points they <em>do</em> have (including against the leader they <em>themselves</em> hated). This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">somewhat offset</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">conversation</a> the leader has with Korra in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the next season</span>.
</li><li> The fourth and final season follows up the events of the previous season by tackling the struggle of rebuilding a war-torn nation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuvira</span> desired to rebuild <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Earth Kingdom</span> and it is later revealed that she was the <em>sole individual willing to take on the task.</em> Her methods are heavily based on military rule, with one of the protagonists being revealed to have been working for her during the time skip. In addition, she refuses to give up her leadership when the other nations wish to re-install a member of the royal family, believing that such an action would undo the past three years of work (which considering the behavior of individual they wished to install, could have very well been the case). The notion of whether any of the actions that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuvira</span> is undergoing could be validated is ultimately rendered moot, when it is revealed halfway through the season that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is building a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a> and has established re-education camps</span>.

At the least, they had Green Arrow try to provide an 'answer'.</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated they couldn't think of a way to resolve the plot on its own, so they had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictKiller">Conflict Killer</a> happen.
<ul><li> The last season of the series shows the League has been given military garrison and regularly has checks from members of the US Government now, and the members of the group agreed they need limitations (like the not keeping a super-zappo-laser on the Watchtower). So yeah, the show didn't skirt the issue and found a reasonable solution - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">at least for the Americans.</a>
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> episode A Better World we have Batman debating with his Justice Lords counterpart whether the JLords' fascist regime is "right". After some back and forth, JLord Batman argues "We've made a world where no eight year old boy will ever lose his parents because of some punk with a gun!", prompting JLeague Bats to concede. Then in a later scene, JLeague Batman manages to change his counterpart's mind... by appealing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">his daddy issues</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">The writers admitted that this was because they couldn't come up with a compelling rebuttal.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "Bats!", Applejack's apple garden gets infested by fruit vampire bats that proceed to feast on it, destroying Applejack's hard work and threatening her business. Applejack wants them driven away so that they leave her crops alone, which brings her into debate with Fluttershy who sympathizes with the bats and insists they need to feed their families and in general are important to the ecosystem. Twilight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAThirdOption">takes a third option</a> and opts to brainwash them into avoiding the apples and Fluttershy is convinced to help paralyze the bats with her Stare so that Twilight can cast a spell on them. However, because Fluttershy was in the range of the spell, she accidentally gets turned into a vicious fruit-hungry vampire herself. After catching her and bringing her back to normal, Applejack feels guilty that Fluttershy suffered from Twilight's "short-sighted solution" and agrees to make a small separate corner for the bats in her garden... So Fluttershy only ends up being in the right because the spell backfired and chasing them away is no longer a viable solution?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> often fluctuates between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">Spoof Aesops</a> and serious ones, with the latter occasionally falling into this. "Best Friends Forever," for example, satirized the Terri Schiavo case and the heated debate over whether to remove her life support, with Kenny standing in for Schiavo. The debate is magically "resolved" when the characters hear an excerpt from the last page of Kenny's will, which all but states the intended Aesop outright: "It's wrong to show people in a vegetative state on national television."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>: Shriek temporarily released a high-pitch frequency pulse throughout Gotham, causing chaos by making speaking incomprehensible and threatened a repeat performance using a more powerful pulse that would kill everyone unless Batman gave himself up to him. Terry wrestled with the morality of sacrificing one life for many, versus the loss his friends and loved ones would experience, and the disgust of sacrificing himself for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">ungrateful</a> populace of Gotham, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">side with Shriek and insist Batman was at fault and should give in to his demand</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terry figures out Shriek is using two giant towers as a tuning fork and confronts him at his base of operations, destroying the towers in the process</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>: Superman ends up on a planet where Kryptonian criminals Jax-Ur and Mala have taken over the native aliens and ruling them like gods and executing anyone who protests their rule. The two are cordial to Superman and try to paint a picture of them improving the aliens' lives via technology and industry but Superman learns from one of them, Cetea, that the pair were about to execute the former leaders of their planet. Despite Cetea's plea for help, Superman is hesitant to take them on directly because Jax-Ur and Mala have been cordial to him and of the damage &amp; destruction that would ensue from a Kryptonian vs. Kryptonian brawl. This is resolved when Cetea, recognizing that this isn't his homeworld, leads Superman to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a secret factory for an invading robot army that will be sent to Earth upon completion</span> and when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jax-Ur and Mala take Superman into deep space to send him into a black hole, and he fights them there, ending up with both of them getting sucked into the hole</span>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out the trope</a> at the end, noting that the aliens re-taught him the lesson that evil triumphs when good men do nothing.

The main characteristic of the alien being that it has godlike power but can't act in even the slightest manner (like walking) if its internal personalities disagree to do so (which they near always do). When Ben is added into the debate it means he'd logically become all powerful because every one of their deadlocks would be broken with what Ben decided to do but then they suddenly start agreeing... to do nothing in opposition to anything Ben says. When Ben calls them out on this, saying that the compassionate personality should want to save lives and the aggressive personality should want to punish evil, compassion starts crying and they completely avoid responding to Ben's complaint.

When a heart-reading unicorn named Celestabellebethebelle declares Mabel impure of heart (and then gives her a few reasons), her reasons are ignored and she is thereafter the villain of the episode because she made Mabel cry. Though Celeste does make some rather callous remarks along with her points, rather than addressing the legitimate parts of her criticisms or showing why Mabel is a good person despite her flaws, the episode concludes with Celestabellebethebelle being revealed as a fraud and the rest of the unicorns as "jerks" who are all actually terrible people with no ability to rightfully judge Mabel at all, thus dodging the issue of her comments' relative validity entirely.

In the season 3 finale, we are told that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose Quartz shattered Pink Diamond, killing her permanently. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> Steven, who has previously insisted upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>, is utterly horrified by this revelation and insists she was wrong to do so. Garnet insists that Rose had no other choice, and destroying Pink Diamond was the only way to end the war and allow everyone to be free.</span> Two seasons later, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose <em>was</em> Pink Diamond and her "shattering" was faked. Steven is just happy to learn she never actually shattered anyone, while dealing with the fallout from that reveal with the Crystal Gems and the Diamonds, and the debate remains unaddressed.</span>
</li><li> The debate is also brought up earlier with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bismuth</span>. She was imprisoned by Rose because she advocated the Crystal Gems should make shattering a normal part of warfare. As in the above example, she provides reasons why she believes this is necessary &mdash; that it would let them defeat their enemies once and for all and save their allies from having to suffer any further at their hands &mdash; but Steven rejects it as morally wrong. Steven is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain">forced to poof her in self-defense</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">the Crystal Gems agree to keep her bubbled after he explains what happened</a>.

The big issue that the team has is that Mira isn't happy about the marriage on principle, and they debate if it's worth interfering since they weren't even invited. They at least decide to attend incognito to support Mira. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out the prime minister arranged the marriage under a sham, so as to cause a Grounder coup, and her fiance curbstomps the invaders. Said fiance then admits he doesn't want to get married either because he likes Mira as a friend and nothing more.
