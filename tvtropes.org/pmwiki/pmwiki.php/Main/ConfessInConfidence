</div></div><p>There are several professions where there has traditionally been a certain level of confidence between the professional and the client. Solicitors, clergy, and medical professionals are the most common examples.
</p><p>Naturally, this is a very useful tool in fiction. You can have an exposition by the criminal <em>and</em> put a person in an unimaginably difficult situation, break their code of conduct or allow a criminal to go free. This trope has three main sub-sets:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><ul><li> Priest-Penitent Privilege: Most often invoked with (or by) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Christians</a>, this practice exists in many real-world religions. There is often scope for conflict between religious and national law, too, as some countries do not recognize it; yet unlike some other privileges, it is, for the priest, absolutely inviolable (for Catholic priests, pardon for breaking confidence has to come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a>, and one of the normal conditions of absolution may be forbidding the priest from ever hearing confessions again. History provides numerous examples of priests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">going to jail, suffering torture, or even choosing death over breaking the confessional seal</a>). Often a case of research failure &#150; the seal applies to <em>sacramental confessions</em>, regardless of where the confession is made, and <a class="urllink" href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950407/REVIEWS/504070308/1023">does not have anything whatsoever to do with<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> whether or not the information was revealed in a confessional <em>booth</em>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Confessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Confessional">Confessional</a>. Also, the confession has to be serious, not a criminal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">sarcastically confessing his crime</a>. If the confessor is not serious about his confession, the priest is not bound to stay silent.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Doctor-Patient Privilege: Less common in cases of crime. Often can be violated in situations where one person's actions put their well-being or the well-being of another at risk. This comes up a bit more often when the doctor is a psychiatrist or other form of psychotherapist since the patient's treatment necessarily involves telling the therapist very private information. (Yes, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>.)
</li><li> Attorney-Client Privilege: Keeping the secret that your client is guilty is often used to show that an attorney is Evil, even if he is just doing what the law requires of him. (Literally. If the client tells the lawyer to shut up, for whatever reason, the lawyer <em>must</em> shut up; actually, the lawyer has to get the client's permission to <em>talk</em> about information revealed in confidence unless it falls under one of the numerous but narrow exceptions to the privilege.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0yz77');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0yz77" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0yz77');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the US, these are: (1) Withholding the information may lead to death or serious bodily injury to someone; (2) The information relates to a future crime/fraud to be committed causing damage to property and the crime/fraud relied on the lawyer's assistance (witting or unwitting); (3) The lawyer needs to reveal the information to keep him/her from breaking another ethical rule; (4) The lawyer needs to reveal the information to defend against a criminal or ethical accusation against him/herself; (5) The lawyer is suing the client for unpaid fees and needs to reveal the information to prove damages; (6) The law requires the lawyer to reveal the information (this is rare); (7) The lawyer is joining a new law firm/two law firms are merging and they need to make sure they have no hidden conflicts of interest; and (8) the lawyer is employed by a company and discovers clear evidence of some kind of serious wrongdoing (unless the company is publicly traded, in which case he/she only needs to find good evidence). As you can see, these aren't applicable all that often; some of them (e.g. #8) are actually quite rare (that one is part of the famous Sarbanes&#150;Oxley Act passed after the whole Enron mess).</span>) This is often the strongest from a narrative point of view, as the others are often not recognised by the courts but lawyers are frequently required to remain silent. One thing that will sometimes bring down an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a> character is the fact that this privilege is strictly one-way: it protects the client but does not protect the attorney. Thus a client who'd previously been manipulated by his own lawyer is perfectly free to disclose to the court everything he told the lawyer, and everything the lawyer told him.
</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>There is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege">Spousal Privilege</a>, in that a person can not be forced to testify about what was said in any and all private conversations with their spouse.
</p><p>Often a case of artistic license when it's a profession that <strong>doesn't</strong> have this kind of privilege (librarians, for example, have patron confidentiality as a professional standard but usually don't have any sort of legal obligation or protection in this matter) unless it's played for laughs.
</p><p>Similarly to librarians, there is generally no attorney-client privilege for scientists, engineers, architects, etc., who provide data, designs, etc., for pay, but there is usually a contractual obligation to keep the data confidential.
</p><p>Engineering ethics (which varies from one professional organization to another) generally dictate that if it becomes obvious that continuing the project will result in either violation of the law or unacceptable risk, the engineer must halt work and contact the employer. Only if the employer is not cooperative, the engineer should resign and contact authorities, though not necessarily in that order.
</p><p>The media do not enjoy legal protection in this manner and may be forced to reveal their sources (on penalty of contempt of court) despite numerous attempts to gain immunity; in what may be an internal case of Not Doing the Research, reporters have been known to claim that they have this right, both in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> and in fiction.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly">For Your Eyes Only</a></em>: After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kristatos</a> has taken the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">ATAC</a> from Bond, Bond goes into a confessional at a Greek Orthodox church and says "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...", and it turns out the Priest is actually Q, who says "That's putting it mildly, 007.".
</li><li> This is the central plot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IConfess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IConfess">I Confess</a></em>.
</li><li> Used rather badly in the 1994 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Priest1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Priest1994">Priest</a></em>. A great moral conflict is created when someone reveals to a priest in a confessional booth that he is committing, and has every intention of continuing to commit, a heinous and disgusting crime. From that point on, the priest is deeply conflicted about whether to reveal this information to the police. The only problem is that the seal of the confessional does not apply in this situation. The seal of the confessional applies to all sacramental confessions, and to sacramental confessions only, regardless of where the priest hears them. To future criminals: if you go into a confessional booth and tell the priest that you have committed a crime, intend to commit the crime again, are not sorry or remorseful at all, and are not seeking any advice or counsel, that priest <em>has every canonical right to turn you in to the police</em>.
<ul><li> In the same film, a young girl tells in the confessional booth that she is the victim of sexual abuse. Again, the seal of the confessional does not apply because she had not done anything wrong, she was the victim. Obviously, you cannot confess and be forgiven for the sins someone else committed.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeddingCrashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeddingCrashers">Wedding Crashers</a></em>, where Jeremy Grey gets drunk and tells the minister who's there to perform a wedding the truth about who he is and what he does. A few minutes later, the truth is out, and he angrily accuses the minister of breaking the confidentiality. However, the minister didn't tell anyone. It was the boyfriend of one of the sisters who discovered the truth through his friends.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A minor plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a> Camaris' confession of his <strike>sins</strike> role in the plot to Father Strangyeard. Camaris is asked to do this because he refuses to reveal his secrets in the open, but the heroes desperately need to know if what he knows has any bearing on their struggle with the Storm King. Although Strangyeard confirms that Camaris knows nothing useful, the confession devastates him, making him admit that for once, he understands why people might wish to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">drown their sorrows</a>. It's also a convenient narrative way to hide Camaris' secret until after the climax when Josua (to whom Camaris also confessed) reveals it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGadfly">The Gadfly</a></em>, the protagonist loses all faith after he learns that his confessor leaked the secret to the police.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthTheBook">Earth (The Book)</a></em> this is double subverted. There is a transcript of a confession where the person confesses to: speeding, a hit-and-run, hitting a cop in the hit-and-run, robbing a bank, and murdering people in the robbery. This causes the priest a lot of discomfort. It seems completely played straight until you realize it was transcribed. This is lampshaded, saying the transcriptions were for 'insurance purposes.'
</li><li> In E.F. Benson's "The Hanging of Alfred Wadham", a murderer confesses to a priest&mdash; to be sure that the priest's the only other one who knows an innocent man is going to die for the confessor's crime&mdash; and that he can't do anything about it.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">Without Remorse</a></em>, a priest counseling one of the girls that Clark rescues from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> tries to get her to talk with the police, as her own crimes are fairly minor compared to having witnessed two brutal murders. Unfortunately, he tells a policeman he knows that he's counseling a murder witness (Without naming her), who tells the Baltimore PD, whose dispatcher unknowingly tells a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a>, who tells the killer, who has the witness tracked down and killed before she can testify.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> Archbishop Maikel Staynair takes the seal of the confessional seriously. In fact, he is absolutely furious when he learns Merlin Athrawes inadvertently eavesdropped on one such confessional, being placated only when assured Merlin has taken steps to avoid it happening again. In that same conversation, Merlin is trying to convince Staynair to release the seal from that confessional in order to help save several endangered people. Though such a thing is within his authority, Staynair agrees <em>only</em> because of the immediate threat to innocent lives.
</li><li> In John Brunner's "The Shockwave Rider" confidential confession through the video phone to a professional listener whose duty is to keep the call confidential is possible. This is allowed through what would now be called an extremely successful hack of the telephone and information network (the book predates the internet). The authorities naturally are not at all keen that this is possible mainly for policy reasons (they don't want it possible to have a conversation they can't listen in on) but also because there are some confessions they really don't want to be made (they don't trust that the hearer will be discreet). An amazingly current book in the themes it addresses.
</li><li> <em>A Prayer for the Dying</em>, a novel by Jack Higgins (later turned into a movie) is about an ex-IRA terrorist whose contract killing is witnessed by a priest. Rather than kill this witness, the killer simply goes round to his church and confesses, knowing the priest will have to keep silent. Unfortunately, the crime boss who set up the assassination doesn't believe that the priest will keep his mouth shut, leading to an inevitable conflict.
</li><li> In the sci-fi spoof novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BillTheGalacticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BillTheGalacticHero">Bill the Galactic Hero</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison">Harry Harrison</a>, Bill goes to see the ship's chaplain, who also doubles as the laundry officer as there's not much call for a chaplain on a warship. Bill says that he thinks one of his crewmates is a spy. The chaplain downplays Bill's suspicions and promises to keep the confession a secret, but as soon as it's time to become the laundry officer again he calls the MPs.

And in case the decision wasn't hard enough, the victim in the case was also a priest.
<ul><li> Several episodes have dealt with Priest confessions. One time, the "confession" was done when the person was walking with a priest. Another, the wife to the head of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryAmoralReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryAmoralReligion">morally questionable sect</a> tries to invoke this privilege with the Church's <em>accountant</em>, but succeeded (Jack later noted judges often don't want to touch the subject of religious privilege).

The information he is able to provide turns out to be just enough for Logan and Wheeler to figure out what the crime was (it helps that even the bare-bones details were relatively unique) and they slowly unravel it.

He knows it's wrong and he also knows the man won't stop (because he keeps coming back and confessing the same sin), but he feels bound by his oath. Elliot eventually convinces him that protecting potential future victims <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">is worth the consequences of violating confidence</a>.

Don Matteo is stumped for a bit but then tells the culprit that he would gladly be excommunicated if it meant putting the culprit behind bars. Then the culprit sees Don Matteo talking to the police and attacks him with a hammer, screaming "I'll kill you so you won't tell them I did it!".

When told that he would keep it secret, she then asks what if she later on murdered someone else by throwing some liquid on her. The Wizard replies that he would rather go to jail than see someone else guilty of a far worse crime go to jail as well.

<ul><li> This has been invoked by many Russian tyrants, most infamously Ivan the Terrible, but he's not the biggest offender for this in Russian history. In the late XIX and early XX centuries, before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>, Russian imperial police required the priests to report any crimes, criminal or political, they learned about in confessionals.
<ul><li> Even after the revolution the practice continued, with the NKVD and its successor the KGB either infiltrating the Russian Orthodox Church directly or paying off priests to act as informers.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a scandal a few years ago where a priest was appointed to a Polish bishopric and was discovered to have revealed secrets he learned in the confessional to the secret police back when the Communists were still in power.
</li><li> There is a new law in Ireland specifically requiring priests to report <em>any and all</em> confessions of sex abuse to the police. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-priests-say-they-will-disobey-new-confession-box-law-on-child-abuse-149029005.html">many are intending to defy the law.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

</li><li> One of the criticisms in how the Catholic church has handled sex abuse cases, and the reason for laws like the one in Ireland mentioned above, is that abusive priests have been confessing their crimes to other priests, essentially using Confession as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

JD has to choose between warning the girlfriend or his professional ethics.
<ul><li> This is averted in some jurisdictions, as sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported to the local health authority and/or the patient's sexual partners. In this specific example, the girl and her boyfriend had not had sex yet, so JD couldn't use this loophole to tell her anyway.

Note that this was entirely unnecessary: as Frasier was seeking assistance in helping his patient, he was well within his professional ethics to discuss said issues so long as it was A) with another licensed medical professional, and B) pursuant to the patient's well-being. A better example is another episode where <em>Niles</em> breaks confidence by gossiping with Frasier about a patient of his who bragged about being a womanizer.

</li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, where it turns out the White House Counsel is not actually the President's attorney:<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16xu0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16xu0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16xu0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The White House Counsel defends the office of the President of the US, in this case meaning anything Bartlet does as President. Any actions as a private citizen, especially the potential fraud while campaigning, would require his own personal lawyer. </span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Bartlet</strong>: Well, Oliver, it really boils down to this... I'm going to tell you a story, and then I need you to tell me whether or not I've engaged 16 people in a massive criminal conspiracy to defraud the public in order to win a presidential election.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Oliver</strong>: Okay. [...] Okay sir, uh... before we go any further, there's something that I want to make sure is absolutely clear.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bartlet</strong>: What's that?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Oliver</strong>: You and I don't enjoy attorney-client privilege.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em>: Neal exploits this when he gets framed and arrested in season 1. Since his attorney is his partner in crime Mozzie, they can use attorney-client privilege to keep the FBI from monitoring them while they plot Neal's escape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>:
<ul><li> Saul Goodman invokes this trope by having his kidnappers give him a dollar so that they become his clients. However, once he becomes a partner in Walt and Jesse's criminal enterprise, they are no longer protected by attorney-client privilege which he fails to mention to them. It is implied that Walt and Jesse do not really know much about the law, and Saul knows this very well.
</li><li> Played more straight when Walt's wife Skyler begins to see through his lies and visits a divorce lawyer to discuss how she can separate from him without hurting their family in the process. Before confessing that she knows Walt is a drug dealer she asks the lawyer in question about the confidentiality issue, who points out that since she's a lawyer and not a cop; she only has her client's best interests at heart.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits">Suits</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mike Ross faces a dilemma when a client confesses to him that he was stoned when he hit and killed someone with his car. Mike has just secured the client a nice plea bargain on the assumption that the death was purely accidental. Mike's parents were killed by a drunk driver and his conscience won't let him keep quiet about what he knows and thus sabotaging the deal, making a weak attempt at hiding how he found out. Katrina realizes that he's broken confidentiality and chooses to accept the plea bargain anyway, before calling him out on it in private. This one is incidentally okay since a plea bargain is conducted in court: a failure to report the information would violate Mike's duty of being honest to the tribunal, and would also possibly be suborning perjury (i.e. allowing someone to lie to the court). Of course, Mike isn't actually a lawyer anyway&#133;
</li><li> When Harvey Specter gets sued by a former client for malpractice, he reminds her that this is one of the circumstances when he is allowed to break confidentiality in order to defend himself against her accusations. While she was his client she told him about various crimes she committed, withheld vital information from him and straight up ordered him to bribe witnesses. Since all of this had a very negative effect on his ability to defend her in court, he will be able to reveal this information in court in order to show that the problems with the case arose because of her wrongdoing rather than any incompetence or malice on Harvey's part. She immediately drops the suit.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em>, Alicia is asked to represent Jonas Stern, the founder of the law firm where she works. Stern intends to represent himself and only use Alicia as a front. In the course of the trial, Alicia discovers that DUI and battery charges were, in fact, not caused by drunkenness but by dementia. Stern forbids her from revealing this in court and invokes attorney-client privilege to keep this a secret from his two senior partners, knowing that one of them wants to force him out. Alicia manages to get the case dropped by getting the arresting officer to admit that the breathalyzer test he administered to Stern at the time of the arrest was negative. Stern returns in a later episode and is annoyed when Alicia innocently asks how he's feeling. He threatens to sue her if she violates the privilege, but she replies that it was a normal, everyday question. This ends up being moot when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he dies some episodes later from a heart attack</span>.
</li><li> In the premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodFight">The Good Fight</a></em> Maia has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment when she realizes that in the current circumstances the family attorney is representing her parents only and thus her conversation with him is not protected by the attorney-client privilege. Since Maia's and her parents' legal interests might be different, he cannot represent all of them and the parents are his default clients. Maia is not happy that he is trying to get her to potentially incriminate herself in front of him even though he can legally be compelled to testify against her.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> has a marine suspected for murder (his vehicle was used in a hit and run killing) tell his attorney that he couldn't have done it because at the time of the accident he was miles away stabbing someone to death. The attorney is unable to inform Gibbs of this because of client-attorney confidentiality but does deliberately give Gibbs a lead by calling him to say that her client's unstated alibi checks out while standing across the street from the scene of the murder the man <em>did</em> commit. She also deliberately uses a pay phone, knowing that the unknown number will look suspicious and cause Gibbs to trace the call.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw">L.A. Law</a></em>, Ann defends a psychiatrist in a negligence suit concerning one of his clients who was convicted of murder. In the course of the trial, she realizes that the accused man couldn't be guilty, and asks her client if he knows who else might have done it. In order to prevent her from re-opening the investigation, he confesses that <em>he</em> did it, at which point attorney-client privilege ties her hands. She consults with a retired DA friend, who correctly tells her she can't do anything without getting herself disbarred and her whole firm sued. He, on the other hand, is both retired and terminally ill, and sends the story to the newspapers without her knowledge or consent, thus bringing all the consequences on himself.
</li><li> The main case in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reckless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reckless">Reckless</a></em> is that of a former female cop suing a local police department for wrongful termination. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a> fires her after explicit videos of her sleeping with a bunch of other (male) cops surface on the Internet. The whole thing looks like a deliberate set-up by the cops, specifically one particular detective, her regular lover. Evidence is found that the video was taken while she was under the influence of drugs, which she doesn't remember taking. At the very end, it's revealed that the girl deliberately engineered the whole situation (even dosing herself for the video and then emailing the video) in order to sue the department and get a lot of money. When her lawyer confronts her, the girl only mildly wonders why the lawyer took so long to figure it out and tells the lawyer that attorney-client privilege means the lawyer has to proceed as before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues">Hill Street Blues</a></em> puts Joyce Davenport in a quandary after her client confesses to killing his cellmate, and then goes on to <em>gloat</em> about the fact he's going to let Officer Coffee take the fall for him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's resolved when said client gets himself gunned down in a shoot-out with the police.</span>
</li><li> Discussed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow">The Andy Griffith Show</a></em>, where Opie tape records a confession between a man and his attorney. When Opie hands the recording to his father, Andy immediately erases the tape and explains to Opie that the law cannot use "that kind of help".

<ul><li> In Anne Mason's Kira Warden books, translators can be put on "sector status" by some government officials; revealing anything they were told under that status is punishable by death, both for the translator and the person they told (meant as a protection against someone coercing the translator to talk). A large part of <em>The Stolen Law</em> revolves around Kira choosing to violate sector status rather than allow a murder, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually discovering that the translations of the law were manipulated to conceal exceptions in the law for such cases</span>.

<ul><li> It is very common to see the characters in any Police Procedural come up against this when dealing Anonymous support groups. In one incident, the sponsor of an alcoholic suspect refuses to tell the detectives anything beyond having met with the guy, thus heavily implying that the man did in fact confess to the murder. While no one has been outright forced to testify, they have been reminded that the confidentiality of such groups is merely ethical, not legal and that they don't have the same privilege as a doctor/lawyer/clergy.
