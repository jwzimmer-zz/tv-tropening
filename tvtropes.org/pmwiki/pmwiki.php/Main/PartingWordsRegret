Katarina saw them as family, but when she got older, she had to be sent back to her real parents. Katarina doesn't like the idea of being sent to people she doesn't know, and tells Buona she's the only real mother she knows. But Buona reminds her she's just a servant, and nothing more. Angry at what this means, Katarina tells her she hates her...but not long after, Buona got sick and died, and Katarina continues to be wracked with guilt over it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, Tohru regrets not saying "take care" before her mother left on the day she died. She had pulled an all-nighter for a test and simply couldn't wake up when Kyouko went to work... There's the implication that she feels responsible for her death. She said it every day, except for the day her mom died...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Orihime regretted not giving her brother Sora her usual fond farewell when he left for work on the day he died because they had an argument earlier. When Sora came back as a Hollow and was defeated/purified by Ichigo and Rukia, Orihime took the chance to say farewell to his departing spirit.

The same day, Osamu was hit by a car...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, shortly before Wall Maria is breached and the Titans enter his hometown, Eren has an argument with his mother Carla about wanting to join the Survey Corps. Minutes later, he is forced not just to flee, but to leave the seriously injured Carla behind to be devoured by a Titan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillOnlySlowYouDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillOnlySlowYouDown">lest they would all perish</a>. He bitterly regrets spending his final moments with Carla having a foolish argument, while furiously vowing to eradicate the Titans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later, it is revealed Keith Shadis had been in love with Carla, and just like Eren, he deeply regrets that he lost his temper and insulted her the last time he spoke to her before her death.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>: Kohta's last words to his little sister Kanae were a threat that he'd "hate her forever" unless she apologized to his friend Lucy, who Kanae <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass">had just accused of murdering people at the festival they were at</a>. He then sees her bifurcated in front of him... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">by Lucy herself</a></em>. He shows clear regret in present times for fighting with her just before she died... although the trauma of witnessing such a thing resulted in repressed memories, so he's convinced himself for much of the series that his little sister actually died of a long illness, and feels regret for not being nicer to her in general.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em>, Kousei's last words to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his abusive and ill mother</span> were that he wanted her dead. His guilt over it is an important part of the trauma that keeps him from playing the piano.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Subaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Subaru">Subaru</a></em>, it gets played with. Subaru gets into a fight with her mother and yells that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWishedYouWereDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWishedYouWereDead">she wishes her sick brother wasn't there anymore</a>, whose condition turns critical shortly after. She is filled with guilt and realizes she can't simply apologize because Kazuma cannot understand words anymore, which was why she was dancing events to him as a form of communication. Then Mana teaches her how to dance sorrow and asking for forgiveness, but Kazuma ends up dead before Subaru can show him.
</li><li> A variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan">Yakitate!! Japan</a></em>, where Pierrot spends a few moments ranting about his parents, who had abandoned him as a baby while drinking with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the King of Monaco</span>, not realizing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the King is his father</span>. When he finally realized that he was essentially insulting his father in his face, the latter passed away before he could apologize. Made even worse when Pierrot found out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou">Daddy Had a Good Reason for Abandoning You</a> and that his father died a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save his life.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a>, Kotomi&#146;s last words to her parents before they died in a plane crash were how she hated them for missing her birthday.
</li><li> Implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>: in their last conversation, Touka got into a fist-fight with Kaneki and concluded by calling him "trash" and telling him not to come back to Anteiku. Soon afterwards, Anteiku is raided by CCG and Kaneki is defeated by Arima, with his ultimate fate ambiguous.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfSnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfSnowWhite">The Legend of Snow White</a>,</em> the youngest dwarf Jolly, who has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">unrequited crush</a> on Snow White, goes through this at Snow White's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>. He had been sulking and snapping at her all day because he was jealous of her love for Prince Richard and worse, it was his going off into the forest in anger, and his fellow dwarf Vet going to look for him, that left Snow White alone and led to her taking the wicked queen's poisoned ribbon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Seeing the Forest for the Trees!", After Ash yelled at her when she attempted to help him, Serena lets his words get to her as she gets frustrated and emotionally hurt with him. Serena then angrily told Ash that he wasn't the friend she knows and to give the real him back. However, while looking for Ash during a blizzard and not being able to find him, Serena became filled with regret as she felt the last few words she said to him got him to run away more depressed. Although, Ash, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardonHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardonHim">who felt remorses for hurting her</a>, somewhat assured Serena that she truly did help him and didn't make things worse at all.
</li><li> In "Memories in the Mist!", Mallow has heavy regrets that the last exchange she had with her ill mother before she died when she was younger was yelling that she hated her for apologizing for not being there for her. When given a chance to meet up with her spirit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse">all those bottled feelings spill out</a> as her mom gently forgives her and encourages them both to turn the regret into gratitude for being there when she was alive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyRoommateIsACat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyRoommateIsACat">My Roommate is a Cat</a></em>; Subaru's parents would often invite him on vacations and trips, which he would reject as frivolous. After they're killed in a bus accident Subaru finds some of his mother's notes, highlighting a number of locales that Subaru might enjoy visiting (such as the childhood home of one of his favorite authors or a few old houses he could use for set pieces for his novels). This causes Subaru to realize how much his parents loved him and how poorly he treated them, causing him to break down and cry.

<ul><li> Victor Alvarez, the second Powerman after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCage">Luke Cage</a> gave up the name, has this in his origin story. Victor's parents were getting ready to divorce, and Victor was upset that his dad wasn't trying harder to make the marriage work. Victor accused his father of not being strong enough to fight for his own family. When Victor saw how much his words hurt his dad, he immediately tried to apologize... and that's when the bombs Bullseye set in Hell's Kitchen exploded. Victor survived <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by somehow absorbing chi from the other victims, including one of Iron Fist's students</span> but he could never forget his dad's wounded expression.
</li><li> Gideon Wilson of the Gamma Corps in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">World War Hulk</a></em>. His son, Jim, told him he was leaving school, they had an argument, it came to blows, Jim told him he was going to New Mexico and they'd never see each other again... and days later Gideon saw a news broadcast warning that the Hulk was rampaging through New Mexico. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xt2h');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0xt2h" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xt2h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's not quite what you think: Jim traveled with Hulk for a while before getting fatal pneumonia. Bruce considered giving him a blood transfusion to save him but in the end wasn't willing to risk the possible side effects. It's unclear what Gideon thinks happened. </span>
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> story had a flashback that showed 8-year-old Bruce getting angry at his parents for some reason and saying that he hated them. In an effort to cheer up Bruce, his parents took him to watch Zorro the very next night. Bruce was about to apologize to them on the way home right when they entered Crime Alley...
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> with Gertrude Yorkes' death. Chase Stein was about to be sacrificed to the Gibborim by Geoffrey Wilder when Gert showed up and bluntly informed Wilder that Chase was a selfish, cheating bastard whose death was unlikely to earn Wilder any points with the Gibborim. So Wilder killed Gert instead, and Chase was left wondering if Gert truly meant what she'd said.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisherMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisherMAX">The Punisher MAX</a></em> series (which puts a lot more emphasis on the Punishers broken mental state than most incarnations) reveals that Frank Castle's last words to his wife were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "I'm leaving...</span>. The guilt of those parting words is partially why Castle launched his crusade, rather than just pure revenge; he wants to punish himself most of all.

He told those in attendance, which included Layne Staley's mother, that the last time he talked to Layne, he urged him to call 911 due to his ailing condition from drug use. Layne refused, and this sparked an argument that ended with Starr storming out. As he left, he heard Layne call out to him "Not like this, don't leave like this." Since Layne is believed to have died the next day, this was the last conversation they had. Starr blamed himself for Layne's death until he died nearly a decade later in 2011.

Katarina was a noble girl who was sent to the country to be raised by a wet nurse, Buona, and her son, Gimo. Katarina saw them as family, but when she got older, she had to be sent back to her real parents. Katarina doesn't like the idea of being sent to people she doesn't know, and tells Buona she's the only real mother she knows. But Buona reminds her she's just a servant, and nothing more. Angry at what this means, Katarina tells her she hates her...but not long after, Buona got sick and died, and Katarina continues to be wracked with guilt over it.	</p>
