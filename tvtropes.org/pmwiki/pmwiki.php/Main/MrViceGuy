</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Apathy</a></strong>. Having personal stakes can make you unpredictable when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> needs you to cooperate. With lives at stake, forsake your passion and stop caring about the outcome and you just might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfApathy">achieve something miraculous</a>.

Just because they aren't idealistic doesn't mean they're bad people. Even if they don't believe things will turn out for the better, they still won't stop doing what's right, because someone has to.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Dishonesty</a></strong>. If you refuse to lie when telling the truth can endanger the ones you love, then sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">doing the honorable thing is best left to the idiots</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy">Envy</a></strong>. Sometimes the good guys can take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> as their companion, whether it's the new guy showing that they can slay monsters more efficiently or if the helpless civilians find him or her more charming than them. While villains would try and drag that other guy down, a hero can take their resentment of their peers and channel it into a zeal for self-improvement.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedSimpleton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedSimpleton">Foolishness</a></strong>. What they lack in brains, they make up for in heart.

Of course, just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleMindedWisdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleMindedWisdom">they aren't intelligent doesn't mean they aren't capable of wisdom</a>.

They just can't keep their hands off of the cookie jar, but maybe it is a coping mechanism the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero">Hurting Hero</a> has to keep themselves from falling apart. Their gluttony can be weaponized to make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">Acrofatic</a> and can be integral when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTeam">Super Team</a> needs someone to win the eating contest.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a></strong>. Money can be an excellent motivator for a hero, giving them the right kind of work ethic to get the job done and accumulate skills necessary to thrive in good times and bad for themselves and the community.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lust">Lust</a></strong>. Some men just can't keep it in their pants and women have needs too, but that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">doesn't make them a bad person</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence">They won't take advantage of you when you're drunk and vulnerable</a>, and they refuse to ruin a preexisting relationship for their own needs, at least not on purpose anyway.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Machiavellianism</a></strong>. Provided it's directed at the right people and not taken too far, being manipulative can serve the hero well. Tricking the enemy by taking advantage of their flaws shows just how cunning the hero can be on the field.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">Mischief</a></strong>. They may not believe in following the rules, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people. They can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster">Karmic Tricksters</a> if the people they trick or prank truly deserve it. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Trickster Mentor</a>, despite their methods, do genuinely believe in teaching someone a lesson and helping them to grow as a person through unusual methods.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Paranoia</a></strong>. Some heroes can't bring themselves to trust others or relax. Yet at the same time, their paranoia isn't unjustified, since they have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">Taught by Experience</a> not to let their guard down, and they still have people they can trust.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a></strong>. The hero can be a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a>, doing it all for the glamour and fame and army of fans, but highly publicized heroics with all of the authenticity of a wrestling match is better than no heroics at all. Besides, sometimes their bravado is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo">completely justified</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Recklessness</a></strong>. They'll throw themselves at danger with reckless abandon for the sheer thrill of it, which can be a serious problem when faced with a danger that won't go down without a serious fight.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Rudeness</a></strong>. They're definitely not the most friendly of people, but the fact they still fight for what is right should say something about them. And sometimes, they may not actually be so mean, showing a heart they reserve only for the people they are close to the most.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">Selfishness</a></strong>. They struggle to think of anyone but themselves and their own needs, no matter how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlySelfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlySelfish">they fake it</a>, but when push comes to shove they'll come through for you in the end.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Sloth</a></strong>. It takes them a while to get out of bed to save your life and they try to do it the easy way first and foremost, but in a stressful world of action and danger sometimes the hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski">has to take it easy and abide for the rest of the sinners out there</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">Solitude</a></strong>. Some heroes usually work by themselves and have refused help. This can hinder them at times when teamwork is necessary, though some things have to be done alone, either to learn independence or because it's personal. The hero may prefer to do things themselves, but they aren't above helping others or receiving help at times, even if they aren't willing to join a group.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StubbornMule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StubbornMule">Stubborness</a></strong>. Some heroes just refuse to quit or lie down. Their determination and willpower to stick with what they believe in is just that strong.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">Vanity</a></strong>. Sometimes a hero is so confident in himself - both as a fighter and a lover - that it can take them to places they are desperate to leave but unable to escape. But that unearned confidence can be incredibly useful if nudged in the right direction. Just because they're vain, doesn't mean they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, nor does it mean they are incapable of acknowledging other people.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Wrath</a></strong>. A short-tempered hero can be a sloppy one, but that rage gives them the focus to face a world of danger without fear. After all, when faced with threats that seek to harm the peace, safety, and tranquility of your loved ones, what's there to be serene about?

</li><li> The Joe Fixit, or Gray Hulk, personality is a straighter example of this, he wears fine, personally tailored suits, eats the finest food (and a lot of it), and of course, heaping helpings of pleasurable company, but is shown to have a certain honor, mostly taught to him by his former employer, Mr. Berengetti.
</li><li> Recent interpretations of the character have indicated that Banner is just as much Wrath as the Hulk. The difference is that Banner's is much more focused, and therefore even more dangerous, with characters thinking that of the two <em>Banner</em> is the more dangerous. This gets backed up by the fact that the Hulk is scariest when he's closest to Banner in personality and intellect.

While Hiccup's biggest strengths are his capacity for compassion and his intelligence, Hiccup was raised in a Viking village who lived under the idea that one's physical strength, skills in weapons, and ability to kill dragons is more important and thus he did not value these skills as much as he should have, causing him to act without thinking ahead. When he tried using his natural skill in inventing to take down dragons his own way, not only did it earn him the scorn of the village (mainly because it accidentally caused a net full of dragons to escape and destroy half of the village in the process), but when it gives him the opportunity to actually kill a dragon, he empathized with the dragon too much to go through with it and freed it instead, a move that could have gotten himself killed.

The downfall of Jurassic Park was in part because of his pride and well-meaning ambition: all he wanted to do was show the world something real, not an illusion like his first business venture, the flea circus Petticoat Lane, and didn't quite care enough how he got there, breeding dangerous dinosaurs such as the velociraptors, stocking the visitor areas with poisonous plants because they look nice, and his reliance on automation to maintain the park being the main reason the disaster could even take place thanks to his corrupt head programmer Dennis Nedry. In the end, after numerous deaths and serious threats to the lives of his grandchildren, Hammond agrees with cynical Ian Malcolm and initially optimistic Alan Grant that Jurassic Park shouldn't be and abandons his dream. This is in contrast to how Hammond was portrayed in the original novel, where he was a Jerkass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who blamed everyone but himself for the park's failure and was planning to try again even after the disaster there, which claimed far more lives than in the film.

He's essentially a modern Hammond, just as kind-hearted and well-meaning, caring more for the happiness of the guests and animals than for his profit margins, and generally sees the good in everyone. Unfortunately, he's a little <em>too</em> trusting, leaving head geneticist Henry Wu and chief of security Vic Hoskins to their devices and ultimately leading to the creation of the hybrid dinosaur <em>Indominus rex</em> which causes another disaster on the island.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick">first film</a>, he completely upends the Tarasov Crime Family, leaving a massive trail of bodies, when the bratty Mafiya prince Iosef stole his car and killed his dog.

In order to cover his tracks after John succeeds in his mission, Santino has a bounty put on John that leads to half of the criminal underworld going after him. By the time he has Santino cornered, he kills him, breaking the ultimate taboo by spilling blood on Continental Ground. Not only does this make him excommunicado from the criminal underworld, but because he killed two members of the High Table, he becomes the criminal underworld's #1 most wanted.

<ul><li> Horace Slughorn is gluttonous and lazy&mdash;he likes to mentor promising young witches and wizards so that when they become famous, he can name-drop them and seek out favors from them. Still, he's a nice guy and pretty much the only unambiguously good Slytherin depicted in the series. He has a lot less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> than the other Slytherins (he still holds prejudices, but only until he has had a chance to meet the person and judge them as an individual) and has no interest in joining the villains&mdash;even spending <em>a year in hiding</em> to avoid joining them, knowing his life was at stake. In the end, he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of three wizards willing to personally fight with Voldemort.</span> This doubles as a demonstration that he's not just 'famous for being famous', or for his potion skills, but that he is an incredibly talented and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">well-rounded</a> wizard.
</li><li> Harry himself is the hero of the entire series. However, his most glaring vice is Wrath, or at least lack of control over his anger and other emotional outbursts. He's also <em>way</em> too foolishly stubborn for anyone's good, including his own, making it easy for other characters to accuse him of occasional arrogance.
</li><li> There was no denying that Dumbledore was a good guy. However, he had a glaring flaw of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>, which led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of his sister, Ariana</span>. He was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">chessmaster</a> who manipulated other characters to fulfill his (fortunately benevolent) plans. Indeed, Dumbledore recognized his vice and acted accordingly&mdash;he knew the worst he could do and was terrified of who he could have been, as revealed when he opened up to Harry. The reason he never became Minister of Magic is primarily that he did not trust himself in the position. His old slogan "For The Greater Good" taught him that he could easily become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>, without even noticing. Some of the most touching parts of his final conversation with Harry was asking whether or not he had gone too far, whether or not he had slipped and once again become the tyrant under the banner of the 'Greater Good'.
</li><li> Ron Weasley is one of the nicest characters in the books, and a major help to Harry in saving the world. However, he also gets jealous very easily, a weakness that threatened to tear apart the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> on several occasions.
</li><li> Hermione is not exempt from this. Her perfectionist attitude and her drive to be as best as she can causes her to somewhat feel threatened whenever someone manages to surpass her, such as Harry scoring higher than her in the Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL, or the potions class in the sixth year.

He also has a lot of pride and vanity&mdash;he likes looking sharp and driving an <em>extremely</em> nice car. However, he is mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> who recognizes that he'll never do anything that humans don't do to themselves far more effectively than hell ever could, and he's even willing to do an occasional good deed on behalf of his angelic buddy Aziraphale (who would in turn do a bad deed for him). In the end, he's one of the most sympathetic characters in the book and wants to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">avert the apocalypse</span> simply because he likes Earth and humanity.
</li><li> Henry Bacon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragons">The Last Dragon Chronicles</a> is staid, grumpy, and old-fashioned to the point of being stifling. He's not exactly a Friend to All Children. He's even the primary antagonist of the first book in the series. However, as the later books prove, he is nonetheless a loyal neighbor who truly does care about his neighbors and their friends. Even if he does think they're a little loopy.
</li></ul><ul><li> Samuel Vimes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> is alcoholic and pessimistic, but still intentionally sympathetic, honorable, and serious about being a cop, in his own way.

Said "slight flaw" includes alcoholism and a perfect willingness to lie to, rob, and kill people to achieve his ends without batting an eyelash. He even freely acknowledges to his much more pure-hearted companion Number Ten Ox that the only reason he didn't become a criminal instead of a crime-solving wise man was that he found committing crimes to be so easy that it became too boring for him. In spite of all of this, he's an unambiguously good guy whose morally questionable actions are done solely to find the ginseng root that will cure the dying children of Ten Ox's village and he isn't shy about expressing his disgust at the reprehensible deeds of the villains they meet during their quest.

Of course, he will forgive you. But first he will shoot whatever you thought you could get away with having in his base, or outside of it, or possibly teleport it into the sun or erase its existence entirely.

<ul><li> This also applies to the rest of the team as well. Eliot Spencer, whose vice is physical violence, and Alec Hardison, whose vice is being kind of a dick (and a hefty dose of pride.) Parker is an unapologetic thief who loves money and lacks basic empathy and Sophie is a manipulative con artist who even manipulates the rest of the team on occasion. All of them are just as reliable, trustworthy, and caring as Ford, if you can get them to show it.

</li><li> Alan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen">Two and a Half Men</a></em>. A deeply loving father and brother and a staunchly good friend to Walden, his virtues are usually overshadowed by his stinginess and cowardice.

Then all his actions, including his work with the CBI, were ultimately driven by the desire for deadly revenge on the killer Red John. Yet he is obviously a very competent case solver, and likeable enough that his co-workers easily forgive him when he has endangered them again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> gives us Oscar the Grouch, who, as his name implies, is perpetually grumpy. He's also extremely selfish, prone to playing mean jokes on others, and will very loudly complain about anything "non-grouchy." But he can, on very rare occasions, show a kindly side (not that he'd ever admit it, as being nasty and short-tempered is <em>expected</em> of his species) and help out his neighbors on the block.
<ul><li> There's also Cookie Monster, who will devour not just his favorite sweets, but anything in his path&mdash;edible or otherwise&mdash;if he's hungry enough. Despite his gluttonous actions, though, he's a sweethearted pile of fuzz who genuinely loves his friends and family, and will often end up doing the right thing even if it means sacrificing cookies.

<ul><li> Eleanor Shellstrop is best defined by her Selfishness. In life she was proven to be a leech who repeatedly ignored the general needs of other people, routinely breaking her promises first short-term pleasures and starting drama unprovoked under the cynical assumption that the world is looking down on her, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a mindset she learned at a young age because her parents were both selfish people who routinely ignored her needs</span>. Michael's torture for her involved her believing that she was mistaken for an objectively better person with who she shares a name with, forcing her to put up with Chidi in order to blend into a neighborhood full of people tailor-made to exacerbate her insecurities. Since her selfishness comes from self-enmity instead of pride, she is fully aware that she isn't a good person, giving her a sobering clarity that the rest of the group seem to lack, with most of the reboots Michael puts them through showing that she is usually the one who finds out that they are actually in the Bad Place.
</li><li> While Chidi is one of the most genuinely nice members of the group and had dedicated his life to learning the perfect moral standard of living through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">careful research, consistently weighing options and finding the objective truth with no heart to give it direction can create the perfect ethical life</a>, but this has also left him with a crippling fear of inducing moral consequences of his actions. This level of cowardice landed him in the Bad Place because while his intentions were good, all it ever did was make the people around him miserable. Michael's method of torturing him was by pairing him up with Eleanor, a "utilitarian nightmare" that gives him an endless list of conflicting ethical quandaries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, Season 3 reveals that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> in his dithering, the archaic nature of the moral point system clashing with the interconnected nature of modern times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">making it impossible for anyone to get into the Good Place for over five-hundred years</a></span>.
</li><li> Tahani has dedicated her life to raising money for charity and good causes, but she only ever did it out of envy for her sister Kamilah, who was always loved more by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> and by the general public. While she did a lot of good that should have earned her points, her selfless desire for attention made all of her actions worthless. In Michael's neighborhood, she would be constantly tormented by the thought that she was second best at everything; she would notice that she had been at the bottom of the points list and become self-conscious by it, she would think that her soulmate Jianyu does not care about her, she would fall in love with Chidi when he preferred Eleanor/Real!Eleanor, etc.
</li><li> Jason is a genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> and has been dealt a rough hand at life by being born in poverty, but most of his problems are caused by his reckless inability to think anything through, usually for short-term immediate rewards. This led to him living a life of street-crime and generally being a stain on society as a whole, with his death (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suffocating in a large safe in an attempt to rob a restaraunt</span>) being a direct by-product of his idiocy. Michael would weaponize his impatience in his Good place experiment by "confusing" him for a silent Taiwanese Buddhist monk Jianyu, forcing him to control his impulses and generally not allowing him to express himself the way he wants.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> is notable for featuring many nice but nonetheless sinful characters, with the two lead characters, Reimu, who's slothful and greedy, and Marisa, who's a compulsive liar and kleptomaniac, taking the spotlight. Aside from them, virtually every character is self-serving and a little too keen on using violence to solve their problems, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">may just be the norm in Gensokyo</a>.
<ul><li> A more glaring, non-human example is Suika. She is firmly on Reimu's side and is one of the few people who are genuinely kind, doesn't rope Reimu into a scheme, and is close to the traditional idea of innocence. The catch: she's never been seen <em>sober</em>.
<ul><li> And she kinda wants to rope other people into her parties...
</li></ul></li><li> It's so bad that one character's issue is pointing out that everyone else deserves to go to hell.

<ul><li> Sonic is very prideful, making him cocky or reckless in the face of danger, but is an easy-going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> in every other area.
</li><li> Rouge the Bat is a government spy with a bad habit of being greedy and obsessive with jewels.
</li><li> Despite being helpful to the heroes and being dedicated in guarding the Master Emerald, Knuckles suffers about three vices. One, he's quite prideful about his strength. Two, he's envious of Sonic's freedom and carefree nature. And three, he has a very short temper which can make him difficult for others to get along with him.
</li><li> Tails is very intelligent, but retains a very childish demeanor, making him impudent or over-excitable.
</li><li> The Chaotix are basically this personified, a misfit gang of so-called detectives who ultimately have good intentions at heart. Vector is extremely brash and rough around the edges and is horrible with money, but notices things others don't and offers his services free of charge to those that deserve them. Charmy is incredibly hyper-active and childish, yet is only occasionally mischievous. Espio often fails to successfully reign in the excesses of his two partners, but is otherwise extremely competent and dedicated towards whatever mission he's assigned to.

Both of them do develop some affection for their teams, but will undoubtedly stick to their vices of wrath and greed.

<ul><li> Weiss is initially a victim of Pride, at first believing she's too good for most people and then certainly better than her partner, Ruby. Character development kicks in fairly quickly and she gets over it.
</li><li> In Volume 4, Blake shows that she's a victim of selfishness. She thinks she's protecting her friends from danger by leaving them behind(especially when Adam swore to kill everyone she loves), but Sun points out that turning away from people who want to help her only hurts them more.

Rebecca is arguably even closer to the trope than Baloo. Her more educated, ambitious, and hard-working nature brought new life to his all-but-dead cargo business, but also caused new problems due to being overzealous and stubborn once she's chosen a particular plan of action.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>
<ul><li> Rarity is vain, very concerned about outer appearances and superficially impressing people, and neurotically concerned with cleanliness to the point that it limits her. Yet, like all the other main characters, she's willing to do almost anything if it's obvious it's right or her friends need it. Besides, her concern with appearances is not just superficial or selfish, as it's an artistic career for her, and she's always willing to help others look fabulous as well.
</li><li> Rainbow Dash is insensitive and overconfident, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">lazy</a> on top of that. She normally doesn't really stop to consider how her actions or words affect others. In spite of their different styles, she's also like Rarity in going rather far in wanting to be admired; both have had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a> episodes. But, again much like Rarity, she'll put her friends first when the chips are really down, and her brashness extends to being brave and heroic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>, Entrapta is a basically nice person suffering from the classical vice of hubris. She'll do virtually anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>, figuring she can handle it and that she can still learn something from a disaster. She doesn't care how any of her discoveries might be used, either, as long as she can make them. The only prospect that even gives her pause is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> complete planetary annihilation.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Homer Simpsons is an alcoholic, temperamental, lazy, glutton. But his heart is in the right place, and he'll go to incredible lengths to protect his family.
</li><li> Marge is normally a loving wife and mother but suffers from a gambling addiction, which can occasionally pop up every now and then. More commonly she is also something of a finicky wet blanket, often unwilling to break from her standard comfort zone, which can make her rather overbearing and humourless. It says something that as often as the kids feel more comfortable around Marge than Homer, they actually find the latter's antics more tolerable than her fussy moods.
</li><li> Lisa is intellectually gifted, philosophical, and compassionate, and all at the age of eight years old. Perhaps because of the awareness of her gifts, however, she can sometimes be incredibly egomaniacal and self-righteous, with an over insistence on being the centre of attention and pushing her beliefs down others' throats, and often insensitively dismissing others as stupider or less significant than her.
</li></ul></li><li> The heroic hedgehog siblings on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground">Sonic Underground</a></em> each have their own short-comings: Sonic is the bravest of the three, and therefore the most brash. Sonia is whiny and overly-concerned with petty things like dirt and dust but has a host of technical and social abilities to make up for it. Manic, meanwhile, struggles with the kleptomaniac impulses he learned growing up (he was raised by a thief), but otherwise is the most laid-back and approachable of the bunch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Krabs has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">single-minded obsession with money</a>, but is shown to care for his employees and his daughter. Unfortunately, he fell victim to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> starting with Season 4 and lost all of his positive qualities. He still displays some kindness every now and then, especially in the episodes made after Stephen Hillenburg returned to the show's helm.
</li><li> Sandy is arguably the one character who has maintained this trait. She is a scientific genius, physically robust to superhuman levels, and thoroughly optimistic and friendly on top of that. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">perhaps because of her many strengths and talents</a>, she often displays an ego problem, which can lead her to be very aggressive and competitive when someone challenges her.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the engines are depicted this way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>, particularly in the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> episodes. As Sir Topham Hatt constantly emphasizes, all of his engines are "really useful" and competent at their specific job on his railway, but nearly each and every one has a heavy shortcoming that causes problems and hinders their work. Thomas for example is optimistic and altruistic but is also impatient and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOhShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOhShiny">easily forgets his duties</a> to focus on some task he finds more important. James meanwhile (though originally more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>) is an extremely headstrong mixed traffic engine, making him versatile for numerous tasks, but sometimes unwilling or easily distracted due to his vanity.
</li><li> Both Buck Tuddrussel and Larry 3000 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad">Time Squad</a></em> are Vice Guys: Tuddrussel tends toward aggressive and childish flaws, whereas Larry's are hedonistic and lustful. Luckily, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondHisYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondHisYears">Otto</a> to keep them in line.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sunstreaker is as brave and heroic as any of the Autobots, but his defining characteristic is his ego. Powerglide and Sky Lynx have hefty egos as well, but they're generally less obnoxious about it than Sunstreaker. Tracks, on the other hand, has a heftier ego and is <em>more</em> obnoxious about it...
</li><li> The Dinobots all have anger and self-control issues, but this just makes them seem childlike and therefore comes across as endearing. Unless you're a Decepticon, then it's scary.
</li><li> Blurr has a problem with impatience.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Rattrap</a> is insubordinate, cowardly (though less so than he may appear), sleazy, and obnoxious enough to irritate all of his comrades. When the chips are down, though, he's as much a hero as any other Maximal. He'll rush in to save the day, guns blazing... and complaining all the while.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Thaddeus Venture of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, despite being mostly portrayed as a cynical, emotionally crippled, amoral slime ball, does occasionally show that deep down he is a decent human being, major examples including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> stopping Brock from murdering his brother at the end of season one, refusing to become the super villain Dr. Killinger had been grooming him to become in season three, and again in season three when he decides to study the super-powerful ORB rather than use it for his own personal gain</span>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">But then again we are talking about a man</a> who creates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">the Joycan, a fully interactive virtual environment</a> powered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">the heart of a dead orphan</a>, resurrects dead people to make them into suicide bombers- (note that said resurrectees are not mindless zombies) and orders his bodyguard to go kill people so he has more corpses to make said Suicide Bomber Zombies. Dr. Venture's decent and humane moments are few and far between.
<ul><li> Keep in mind, too, that one of the overreaching arcs of the show has been the slow redemption of dear old Rusty. The first season featured loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> moments for him, but these have toned down as time went on. By season 3, he's just more of an insensitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, with his 'worst' crime that season probably being when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">covered up the death of one of his daycamp kids with a sloppily made clone made from DNA in the dead kid's shoe</span>. Better than the Joycan, at least.
</li><li> And he cured some genetic diseases the kid had, too.
</li></ul></li><li> Now Brock Sampson on the other hand is closer to an unambiguous example... he definitely puts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">heroic in "heroic" and the sociopath in "sociopath"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ruel Stroud in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> is a treasure-hunter with an obvious attachment to money, but when his traveling companions are in danger (especially his best friend's adoptive son) he'll rush to their defense.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder16" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Florence Nightingale, despite being a lovely person who saved countless lives, ironically seemed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">think that women were inferior to men,</a> and couldn't do anything right, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">her own success would seem to disprove this claim.</a>
</li><li> Martin Luther King, Jr. would also count. Although he is rightfully credited with doing a lot of good for the Civil Rights movement, he did cheat on his wife at least once and plagiarized part of his doctoral thesis.
