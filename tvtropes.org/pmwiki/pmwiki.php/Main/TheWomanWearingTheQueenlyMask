But she is the one best equipped to see them through the current war or other disaster, and she sure as hell isn't going to turn the country over to the treacherous aristocrats who would be next in line if she stepped down.

</p><p>An important part of this character is that she isn't in a trusting and happy relationship (platonic or otherwise) as this would make her burden less heavy for her and thus remove much of the conflict inherent in this archetype.

He was pushed into running "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">the family business</a>" after his father died before even reaching fifteen years old (to give you an idea how well that's accepted, his friend Firo's initiation to a similar position at eighteen was met with "Wait, you can possibly... <em>Really</em>...?

So, to be taken seriously, he overcompensates like hell and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">puts up a front of ruthlessness</a> that even he starts believing &mdash; though his best friend and adoptive brother both see right through it.

<ul><li> Being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">second in command</a> in the most successful army in Midland - and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">the sole woman</a> at the same time - Casca always had to deal with this and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">quite cold</a> because of her job. However, this became more evident when the Band of the Hawk got into some deep shit after their charismatic leader, Griffith, got arrested and imprisoned after Guts, a man who got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">both of their affection</a> (one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">a bit more extreme</a>, which led to his erratic behavior in the first place), left the Hawks, which left Casca in charge. Casca became so physically and emotionally drained during this time, not only because two men that she respected and loved were not by her side, but because she was in charge with keeping the Band of the Hawk together AND alive (since they became fugitives upon Griffith's arrest). She was able to keep her cool for the most part... but when Guts comes back after a year, Casca just lets it all spill out, and almost attempted suicide.
</li><li> The Queen of Midland to a degree, in that she's a naturally passionate woman expected to act like a queen to a distant husband, which is why she ended up having an affair with the king's brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(that the king has the hots for his own daughter due to her resemblance to his first wife doesn't help)</span>. Unfortunately, Griffith's meteoric promotion led to the king's brother getting shafted, and she took it on herself to have Griffith removed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">which didn't work out well for her</a>.

Her characterization throughout the film is largely in keeping with this idea.

Specifically, she was forced to marry a much older man who completely disregarded her, most tellingly eating her food and drinking from her glass without asking permission. So she poisoned her own wine.
<ul><li> It doesn't get any easier when our good friend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eugenides</span> wins her love and becomes King of Attolia. He's happy as a clam to be married to the woman he fell in love with so long ago, but he isn't so hot on the job that comes with it.

However, she does not have to worry about doubts of a woman ruler, as Belleza (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> version of Venice) would not accept anything <em>but</em> a female ruler.

Her problems are not caused by her sex or youth, but by her not actually being a queen yet. She has to deal with a civil war caused by other aspiring queens, not to mention some highly irritating magic wielders and being pregnant to a man whom (and whose children) dozens of people would love to kill.

Chosen as an Ol-zhaan at thirteen (the usual age) her psychic gifts and personal charm were such that she was made High Priestess only two or three years later. Like all Ol-zhaan she could have "close communion" love affairs but was forbidden to pair-bond (marry) or have children.

She has workaholic tendencies and once noted that she cannot indulge in romance, though she has considered proposing a diplomatic marriage to one of her allies. Murtagh has a one-sided crush on her, which will probably turn out to be important in the last book of the series.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turns into a more literal example at the end of <em>Inheritance</em>, when Nasuada is declared Queen.

Kristin then agreed to take the throne, but that of course meant she could no longer marry Mark or be his lover. After that, she had to be totally formal with Mark and hide her true feelings. The mask slipped once or twice, as when her uncle, the wizard Karel, was reluctant to leave them alone together, and Kristin angrily pointed out that it was <em>way</em> too late to be worried about that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It all worked out in the end when Mark was revealed to be the son of the Emperor, and as such an appropriate consort for the princess after all.</span>
<ul><li> Subverted with Yambu, the Silver Queen, in the same series. After she became queen, she became detached and distant, and could never let her true feelings show; but at the same time was also pretty informal, and took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">any man whom she pleased</a> as a lover, although she never had any feelings for them, of course. She's also a subversion in the sense that her emotional detachment is necessary for her to commit the crimes she proceeds to carry out in power, including selling her own daughter into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">slavery</a>.

Unfortunately for her, along with power it also confers mental instability and delusions of grandeur that has isolated her from both her family and people, not to mention the hard decisions she has had to make to keep her country from full-scale civil war. The game actually plays with this early on, trailers and her actions at the beginning of the game portraying her as a merciless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Tyrant</a>, totally at odds with her real character. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note082un');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note082un" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note082un');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Arshtat was not always this trope; she became queen during a time when the country was on the verge of civil war.

Those years were probably the happiest of her life. However, things started to go downhill about two years before the start of the game, when events forced her to bear the Sun Rune. That's when she became this trope. Her sheer force of personality, along with her husband's, had been keeping the country stable for that entire time. But with the run pushing her closer to the edge, both of them know that it's only a matter of time before she goes completely insane, and/or the political groups make a grab for power (restarting the civil war). </span>

</li></ul></li><li> Princess Elodie, the heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen">Long Live the Queen</a></em>, is a young girl who has just had the responsibility of ruling an entire country thrust upon her well before anyone expected her to be ready for the task, least of all Elodie herself. The mood swings she experiences are important for players to consider, given that her attitude affects how well she does in her weekly classes. Focusing on being loyal and eloquent and neglecting to learn how to run an empire or command an army or fight will likely get her either killed or overthrown. Usually killed. On the flip side, focusing on developing her military commanding and combat skills at the expense of court manners or royal demeanour may impact how she behaves in front of her other nobles, which can also result in getting her killed or overthrown. Usually killed.
</li><li> While only metaphorically royalty, Franziska von Karma of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> counts. She is the daughter of a legendary prosecutor and feels pressured to live up to his image, despite her self doubts and her fears that she can never be perfect. She slowly comes to realize that her father was only able to stay 'perfect' because he cheated, coached testimonies, falsified evidence, and probably got a lot of innocent people convicted.

Season 5.2 made it especially clear that she's having a breakdown caused by all the stress she's under throughout the series. She fears dying because it would leave the Candy populace unattended and she has few confidants, namely Lady Rainicorn and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> Finn. The latter is complicated given how he had feelings for her for the longest time and how her own tendencies means she can be suspect in how much she cares about him (though it does become clear she genuinely treasures their bond and cares for him as a friend.) She is somewhat unrespected (though that's namely because of her surveillance and her subjects come to appreciate her more when they realize living under the so-called King of Ooo is pretty bad).
<ul><li> It's telling that when she was temporary restored to her 13-year-old self, she did not want to take back the reigns of her 18-year-old self. She preferred to indulge in youthful merriment, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">spending alot of close time with Finn.</a> She was also more jovial and light-hearted. She only re-aged herself back up since her successor Lemongrab was running the Candy Kingdom to the ground and even then, she was reluctant to.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Princess Celestia may technically be one of the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Empresses of Ponykind</a>, but she hates her duties and the court protocol so much, she enacted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to manipulate the mane characters into <em>destroying half her palace</em> as an excuse to get out of having to deal with a formal soiree, so she could just hang out with said characters at the local donut shop instead without breach of protocol. It's hinted that her centuries of isolation without Luna was a big reason why.
</li><li> At the beginning of "Sweet and Elite", Rarity is given a room in the palace while staying in Canterlot and goes overboard with the praise, going so far as to <em>kiss Celestia's hooves</em>. The princess is visibly uncomfortable the entire time.
</li><li> In "Princess Twilight - Part 1", Celestia explains to Twilight that she's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">enduring</a> the Summer Sun Celebrations for the sake of her subjects, even though it's served her only as a bitter reminder of her needing to banish her sister. However, she is much happier and looking forward to the one in this season, since it now serves as a celebration of her and Luna reuniting.
</li><li> Luna too displays some of this. Though she gets upset when her subjects display fear towards her, she is clearly more comfortable as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady">distant, imperious monarch</a> as a means of hiding her more vulnerable nature.
</li><li> After Twilight Sparkle becomes a princess, she notably averts this, acting the same as she did before ascending. She even tells her friends not to refer to her as "Princess Twilight."
</li></ul></li><li> The driving antagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> are led by a trio (formerly a quartet) of royalty-caste beings called the Diamonds, who led a highly invasive multi-galactic empire. As the show develops these antagonists, variations on this trope come into play:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Yellow Diamond</a> could be seen as touching on this trope &#151; she <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtA-juh3rf4">has a song<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> trying to convince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">Blue Diamond</a> to get over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain">Pink Diamond</a>'s death</span>, but by the end it's pretty clear that she's close to tears herself. (Blue Diamond may also count, but it's not clear if she's even <em>trying</em> to hide her depression.)
<div class="indent"><em>"Don't you know I miss her too?!</em> <br><em>But tell me...</em> <br><em>What's the use of feeling..."</em>
</div></li><li> We later find out that Pink Diamond zigzagged this. While the Diamond Authority was a rule of four equals on the outside, Pink, being the youngest, was often brushed aside <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as incompetent, and had begged for her own colony because her authority was essentially a farce put on for their subjects. But when she got the colony she asked for, she realized to her horror that completing colonization would kill the life that lived there &#151; a truth she'd been unaware of, as she'd believed that Gem production "created life from nothing"; she later miserably concludes that they are instead "stealing life and leaving nothing behind."</span> When Pink made the decision <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Ruler of Earth to spare the Earth from the resource extraction process that would destroy it, Yellow and Blue wrote her off as irresponsible and ungrateful, usurped control, and made her only task to smile and assure her subjects that the Rebellion that had cropped up against Gem Homeworld rule was no threat. Unbeknownst to them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Pink had created the Rebellion herself</a>; her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetQueen">Puppet Queen</a> role was a part she played in the hopes that her careful balancing act would last until her rebels could free the colonized planet; she even spread Anti-Pink propaganda to incite them further.</span> All the while the Diamond Authority continued putting on a front of being a single, cohesive, flawless oligarchy in order to hold their empire together.
</li><li> Ironically, the rebel leader Rose Quartz <em>becomes</em> this. Initially Rose's purpose was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for Pink to be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">socialize with others and experience freedom from the restraints of her class</a></span>, but since her decision to spearhead a Rebellion, she had to become whatever necessary for her fellow rebels to believe in her competency in leadership and maintain unity in the cause. She had a lot of personal baggage that probably would have torn the Rebellion apart if her secrets had been known and led to the doom of the Earth, humanity and the rebels, so she hid her flaws under a graceful, perfect, wise, infallible veneer in order to keep the Rebellion together. Which ironically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though not uncoincidentally</span>, reflects many traits in the fa&ccedil;ade propagated by the Diamond Authority about their own leadership.
<ul><li> Furthermore, this would meant that Rose would be unable to connect with any of the other Gems as equals because of her mask. Even Pearl, her close confidant, viewed their relationship not as equals and could not provide the emotional support or intimacy she needed. Ultimately, this would be why she would end up with Greg Universe. Greg liked her for her and they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">Birds of a Feather</a>. He <em>pushed</em> her to be honest and to change to be more open, furthering her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and giving her some much needed emotional support. Of course, the other Gems didn't understand this nor why Rose would wanna have Steven at the risk it came to her despite being so beloved (though it's implied Garnet begins to nderstand once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">The Chains of Commanding</a> begin wearing on her.)

(Elizabeth to the troops at <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">Tilbury<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as the Spanish Armada approached.)
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a> wore quite literally a Queenly mask, painting her face white and bedecking herself with jewels as she got older, to emphasise the cult of youthful virginity that grew around her.
</li><li> Elizabeth II, as mentioned in the entry about the film <em>The Queen</em> above, has quite a bit of this trope in her story, too.
</li></ul></li><li> Urraca, Queen of Leon and Castile from 1109 AD to 1126 AD. She was Queen in her own right and reigned alone from 1110 onwards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> of Austria fits this trope perfectly &mdash; she had great difficulty in establishing the claim of her husband, Francis of Habsburg-Lorraine, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a>; she was betrayed and made war on by her nominal subject Frederick II of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Prussia</a>; and though she was devoted to her husband, his philandering made her bitterly unhappy; and her son <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephII">Joseph II</a>'s progressive policies troubled her deeply. She was also a major Badass. She once gave birth then rushed off, to command her troops in battle with the baby in her arm (though admittedly she lost that battle).
</li><li> Queen Isabel of Castile (Isabella, of "Isabella and Ferdinand" fame), who, besides sending Columbus to the New World, often led troops while pregnant, in course of the Reconquista. Fittingly, she was one of Maria Theresa's ancestors.
<ul><li> Her daughter, Catherine of Aragon, proved that this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a>. Her first marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, ended abruptly with her young husband's death, leaving her in a dangerous political position. Her marriage to Arthur's younger brother Henry VIII fixed that problem, and for several years they were actually quite happy together; she often ran England while he was away fighting the French, even defeating the Scottish troops in a battle she personally directed. After Henry threw her over for Anne Boleyn, however, she took on the Queenly Mask rather than let her detractors see how much she was suffering, and continued to insist that she was the rightful Queen Consort. Even though she was kept apart from her only living child and eventually developed a cancer that would kill her, she remained loyal to Henry and to England until her last breath.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a> <em>had</em> to be this at the beginning of her reign, because her claim for the Russian throne was dubious at best - she wasn't Romanov or even Russian at all, leading many to basically ask, "Seriously, what the hell?" But when her position was somewhat stronger, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">relaxed a bit</a>.
</li><li> Empress Elisabeth of Austria (<em>Sissi</em>) has to fall into this category. She was shy and introverted by nature, and excruciatingly ill at ease among the stifling formality of Hapsburg court life after she married Emperor Franz Joseph. However, she was viewed as a fairy tale princess and beloved by the common people of Austria and Hungary.
</li><li> Hawaii's last queen, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Liliuokalani">Queen Liliuokalani<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Her husband cheated on her <em>numerous</em> times... and she had the misfortune of reigning just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eagleland</a> was taking over Hawaii.
</li><li> The Celtic queen Boudicea. Her husband was killed, she was beaten, and her two daughters were raped by Roman invaders. She did not choose to take that sitting down and declared war on them. She was ultimately defeated but did so much damage that <em>to this day</em> excavators in London still find what's been deemed the "Boudicca's Destruction Horizon" so she certainly didn't go down without a fight.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0c1g9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0c1g9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0c1g9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's less heroic than that in reality. The Romans were the underdog in the war against her, not the other way around. Boudica was defeated even though she held massive numerical advantage over the Romans. The Roman Governor Paulinus' already small army was made even smaller when one legion refused to answer his call to arms and another got routed while trying to reach him. In total, Paulinus had only 10,000 men to his name against Boudicca's 230,000 (per Romans accounts). Emperor Nero found the situation so hopeless that he considered abandoning Britain altogether. Inspite of this overwhelming odds, Paulinus chose to fight on his own terms rather than run, eventually picking a bottleneck location where Boudica's superior number was ineffective and attacking her entire army head-on. The poorly-equipped Iceni warriors were no match for the heavily-armored Romans and died in droves. The battle might not have ended in total disaster had it not been for one giant blunder from Boudica's part. She had set up some wagons behind her army to let their families witness a triumphant victory over the Romans, only for those wagons to end up preventing <em>her</em> army from escaping when the battle went south for them instead. Unable to retreat, the panicked Iceni got absolutely massacred. Her rebellion fell apart soon after this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackDefeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackDefeat">Crack Defeat</a>.</span>
