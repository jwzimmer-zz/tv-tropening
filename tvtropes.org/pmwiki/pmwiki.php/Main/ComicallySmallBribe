</p><p>This is when a character tries to bribe somebody, but the bribe is either pathetically small or involves something of no conceivable value to the recipient. Common reactions include an incredulous stare, dismissive laughter, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire">arresting them for attempted bribery</a>. Alternatively, the recipient may enthusiastically accept the bribe, much to the amusement of the audience. (A once-common form of this variant involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canadians being bribed in American currency</a>, although economics can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">largely ruin any humor it holds</a>.)
</p><p>Common variations are:
</p><ul><li> Attempting to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a> money or a minor coupon in place of real cash.
</li><li> Doubling the payment of voluntary or forced labour, and when they refuse on the grounds that double of nothing is still nothing, the briber offers to triple the payment.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Bribing people with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">something they have in a great abundance</a>, like offering a rock monster a rock you just found on the ground. Or something that isn't valuable or isn't even useful to their culture or situation, i.e. anything they'll call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>.
</li></ul><p>Sometimes gets inverted; the initial bribe is very large, at least by the standards of the person offering it. The other character refuses it but accepts something comparatively worthless instead, maybe even making the reduced counter-offer themselves. This is more likely to be a dramatic example than the normal way around&mdash; typically because the person taking the "bribe" has reasons of their own to do what's asked of them, but want to make a statement of some sort with the token payment. A specific example common in the real world is taking a single dollar (or local equivalent) as payment for services rendered; this is done because both sides have to give <strong>something</strong> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration">in order for a legal contract to exist<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Such an absurdly small payment is referred to in legal parlance as a <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppercorn_%28legal%29">peppercorn<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, after the rent paid yearly by the Freemasons of Bermuda for their meeting hall: a single grain of black pepper.

Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>, where the characters treat something as being less valuable than it is, rather than more valuable. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">Not Rare Over There</a>, where something is valuable to someone, but only because they need it and can't find it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySmallDemand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySmallDemand">Comically Small Demand</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldHisSoulForADonut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldHisSoulForADonut">Sold His Soul for a Donut</a>, where someone sells their soul for something comically insignificant.

Now, he'll give them out for two apples from Earth. Even beyond the fact that apples aren't exactly expensive or uncommon, shinigami are invisible and able to become intangible at will; it'd be trivially easy for any of them to just steal any number of apples.
</li><li> Played straight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> where Master Roshi attempts to buy one of the Dragon Balls from a gang of thieves.

However, when Soma makes an off-hand remark that someone in the dorm has all of the volumes of a shojo manga she's reading, she agrees to taste his food if he lends her the remaining volumes, since she doesn&#146;t know where to get them by herself.

You can choose to either play this trope straight and offer them a few gold pieces (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">a completely over-the-top manner</a>) or avert this trope by offering them a more impressive reward that's still nothing but pocket change for you.

It's a one-time offer. There's no opportunity to get gold from a container. So the bribe just has to be a sufficiently large fraction of the gold you have in open inventory. Carrying $10 in the open when necessary makes the bribe very cheap indeed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em>:
<ul><li> Happens annoyingly often, when the rival powers start threatening you with destruction unless you cough up some cash. "Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">mein freund</a>, I'm afraid the price for peace with the Holy Roman Empire is<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticPause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticPause">...</a><em>one hundred and thirteen Florins!</em>" And yes, if you refuse there is a good chance they'll invade.
</li><li> Of course they're just as likely to invade you a couple of turns after receiving your bribe, backstabbers. However a easy way to keep the Vatican on your side is to set up a "donation" to the state every turn - even <em>one single florin</em> will be appreciated, amusingly.
</li></ul></li><li> Also happens amusingly often in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> series.
<ul><li> After annihilating another country's military and leveling some cities, they say, "Please make peace with us! Here's 25 gold!" If their empire is that poorly run, perhaps they deserve to get invaded. Justified when the AI civ offering the bribe is the one that just got its cities ransacked: it's likely all they can afford, and if they're facing annihilation, it doesn't hurt to try. The player might even take the offer if they were planning on taking a breather before making the final push.

Proposing that someone enter an exclusive alliance with you, declare war on everyone else and give you all their techs and planets in exchange for 1 credit will be treated as a grave insult, and depending on the leader may very well lead to war.
</li><li> On the other hand, while the AI is aces at managing its economy to the fullest, it rarely builds up overly large savings to negotiate with. Furthermore, what wads of cash it has it tends to blow them away in rush-bought (or worse, leased) spaceships as soon as a war begins. Which means that should the war go pear-shaped for them, they are often reduced to begging for peace in exchange for all they have: 5 shiny credits.
</li><li> Technically funds are measured in bc, "billion credits", but 1 bc is still chump change compared to the cost of running an interstellar empire.

This is an in-universe insult to the Thalmor more than anything. Murdering other people comes at a much higher price.
</li><li> If you get caught committing a petty crime in a city where the Thieves' Guild's influence is high, you can pay half the fine for guards to go away.

In a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, this actually makes sense. Once the Space Marines have been dealt with, the remaining Orks would have to be mopped up to avoid further contention in the area.

If they're offering a lot of missiles or fuel or a nice weapon, you'll probably take them up on it. But if they offer one missile, one fuel, and only a handful of scrap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">you really have to wonder</a> how much value they place on their lives.

The chieftain is understandably noncompliant, and your translator notes that they have no use for your money since they can't actually spend it. The actual goods he <em>will</em> take in exchange turn out to only cost 400, though; half that if you're good at negotiating. The Sand People mostly just need somebody to pick them up, since the store is in a settlement they're at war with.

On occasion, however, this system can glitch out and lead to the computer offering to get out of a Reconquest of half its current territory for war reparations and a handful of ducats, even though you've crushed all its armies and are currently busy sieging down its capital.

The three scientists plead for their lives by trying to bribe an augmented bio-warrior with <em>$100-1,000</em>. It's not known if the 'filthy rich' sums they were getting from their employers for committing mass-genocide really were in those low brackets, or if they can't bring themselves to pay an even larger bribe to a black man.

(Hilariously, before the exchange, the kid lectures Phoenix on the importance of equal value exchange of goods and services). Phoenix is only able to provide that rare card by trading <em>another</em> rare card to another collector.

As these bribe items are all part of a larger metapuzzle, most of them are not exactly the kind of valuable/rare items you'd expect supervillains to be swayed only by, which leads to humorous scenarios like successfully bribing Doctor Doom with a <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">garden hose</span></em>.

<ul><li> The German satirical magazine <em>Titanic</em> offered a cuckoo clock, sausages and ham to delegates of the FIFA World championship committee to support the German bid to host the 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a>. A $20 value for arguably the biggest sporting event in the world. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(magazine)#2006_FIFA_World_Cup_bribery_affair">Amazingly it worked<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as one of the delegates who was supposed to vote for South Africa felt this ridiculous fax was the straw that broke the camel's back, and after all the pressure from both sides, abstained from voting, causing the final vote to be 12-11 in Germany's favor. South Africa did get the World Cup in 2010.
</li><li> On November 8, 2009, Chad Ochocinco of the Cincinnati Bengals offered an official $1 during a replay challenge on one of his own catches. Even though he was joking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">he got hit with a $20,000 fine.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/bribery-adjusted-for-inflation/502">This<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight">Not Always Right</a> entry has a customer, convinced that the cashier knows when the store will get more Wiis but is trying to keep it secret, try to bribe him with $20 for the info. As the cashier points out, even assuming he <em>did</em> have secret knowledge of the store's shipments, $20 is not worth the punishment he'd get for giving out such a secret.
</li><li> People find it amusing when politicians and bureaucrats revealed to have accepted bribes turn out to have accepted what seem to be ridiculously small bribes in exchange for their favour. A few million dollars, people can respect that. A few thousand dollars worth of <em>furniture</em>, on the other hand...
<ul><li> Though this could be them trying to seem subtle- a truckload of new furniture isn't nearly as suspicious as several thousand-ish dollars suddenly appearing in the bank.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>'s contests on his blog, such his limerick contest and photo caption contest have always given tiny rewards of "a shiny new dime." In the case of the caption contest, it became satirical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> when the winning entry was accused of plagiarism, and the prize given to another, only to find that it wasn't and for the original winner to receive his dime after all.
<ul><li> His "Outguess Ebert at the Oscars" defy this, as being official contests the prizes can range as high as a private screening to the years' Ebertfest or Pixar film. The most recent prize was the highest, $100,000, a year that Ebert only correctly guessed 15 Oscars out of 24.
</li></ul></li><li> Stephen Merchant's harrowing encounter with a nightclub bouncer certainly counts. It's one thing to flaunt your cash in front of some girls, quite another when that attempt consists of offering 7 quid on a 5 quid entry fee.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> offered to buy the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> franchise for $10,000. This was apparently not taken seriously, as the rights were up for sale, and ended up not being sold.
</li><li> A contestant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFortunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFortunes">Family Fortunes</a></em>, whose family had not covered themselves in glory, once offered to buy the rights to that episode so it would never be shown &mdash; for &pound;100. The producer had to explain to them that this fell somewhat short of covering the show's &pound;38,000 costs.
</li><li> The anti-corruption organization <a class="urllink" href="http://india.5thpillar.org/">5th Pillar<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> prints <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_rupee_note">zero rupee notes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which are intended to shame officials who ask for bribes.
</li><li> Bribery often takes the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfWealthAndTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfWealthAndTaste">items of wealth and taste</a> rather then money because money seems less "classy". One mole in Russia was paid by the CIA with a custom sporting rifle, although in his case he intended to defect for ideological reasons and simply asked for the bribe on the "why not?" argument.
</li><li> When a painting was stolen from the Museum of Bad Art, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Bad_Art#Thefts">a reward of $6.50 was offered for its safe return<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The stakes were later raised to $36.73, but eventually it was returned with no ransom paid.
</li><li> North Korean border guards are reliably known to both Chinese and North Korean contraband smugglers to accept cans of Coke as an acceptable bribe to look the other way when going in or out of North Korea. Utterly priceless to the North Koreans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">still a dollar or less per can to the Chinese</a>.
</li><li> The inverted version has happened numerous times in real life, usually either selling something for $1 or working for $1 a year. Although most of these people working on $1 salaries are <em>actually</em> paid in stock options and other perks that would easily be worth millions of dollars (it also serves as a convenient tax dodge; in America, income from stocks are taxed more leniently than salaries).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> was groped by a radio host by the name of David Mueller at a fan event after a concert in 2013 while they were taking a picture. She told his employer what happened and he was fired. He sued her for $3 million in damages for losing his job and for defamation in 2015. She countersued him for $1 for sexual assault. She won the case and dollar.
</li><li> The Knights Hospitalier were given the islands of Tripoli, Malta and Gozo by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1530. The yearly rent on all three (pretty sizeable) islands was a bird &mdash; a single Maltese falcon &mdash; and the Knights duly paid up until 1798. This is where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalteseFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalteseFalcon">famous detective story's</a> title comes from.
</li><li> There exists a superstition that giving a knife as a gift is bad luck (symbolizing the severance of a relationship). Therefore, it is customary for those who believe this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">"buy" the knife instead</a>, with whatever small change they happen to have in their pocket at the time.
