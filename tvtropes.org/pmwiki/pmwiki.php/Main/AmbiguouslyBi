The vast majority of the time, male characters are attracted to women, and female characters are attracted to men, there are some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerAsTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerAsTropes">gay and lesbian characters</a>, and very rarely you'll get a bisexual character (unless it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance">Queer Romance</a>, where naturally the last two categories are more common), but others aren't so definite. Sometimes there's a male/female character who doesn't express interest in women/men but does seems to show interest in people the same gender as they; they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>. Then there are characters that seemingly show romantic and/or sexual interest in people of multiple genders; they're Ambiguously Bi.

Characters with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life Partner</a> are especially prone to this, as while they might have an actual love interest of a different gender or try to get a love interest through flirting and having crushes on women, the relationship with their HLP often has a romantic/sexual element as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a> can be a reason for this trope, the writers wanting to include hints a character is gay or bi but with enough heterosexuality to appease the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>.
</p><p>It should be noted that what makes a character Ambiguously Bi and what differentiates them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bisexual">Bisexual</a> characters is largely a matter of opinion. The character does not have to officially be declared bi to qualify, and as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">No Bisexuals</a> demonstrates, even if a character is clearly bisexual to the audience, much of the time the writers don&#146;t consider it as a possibility. Obviously, some form of attraction to people of different genders is required, but the exact extent varies; for some people, an offhand comment or a prolonged glance can be enough; for others, nothing short of onscreen sex can suggest bisexuality as a possibility. Characters who express <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">If It's You, It's Okay</a> further muddle the issue, as by definition, that makes a character bisexual, but there <em>are</em> otherwise straight, gay, and lesbian people in real life who do have exceptions to the "rule" of their sexuality.

She also has a girlfriend, Ginger. The vague part is if Chuck is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">beard</a> or if they were a legitimate couple before she fell for Ginger.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a>, especially under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a>'s pen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em>. At one point she was going to quip that she was "75% heterosexual" thus making her bisexual, but placeholder dialog confusion turned it into "heterosexual to the bone". And when she believes she's going to have to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a> she tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a> to tell both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle">Barbara</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Oliver Queen</a>, her ex-husband, that she loves them. In that order. To say nothing of <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906094341/http://i573.photobucket.com/albums/ss175/galateus/comics/babsdinah-25uo2a0.jpg">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2000">Cassandra Cain</a>'s canon love interests have all been men, with her first romantic kiss coming from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy">Superboy</a>. However, she displayed a fascination with a young ballerina named Christine (even watching her dance from the shadows), and agreed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a>'s offhanded comment about wanting to marry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>: Johnny Storm, according to some <a class="urllink" href="http://titanstogetherr.tumblr.com/post/152136986151/johnny-storm-is-officially-bipan">fan theories<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In addition to doing things like dating non-binary aliens, it was strongly hinted that he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken">Daken</a> had a fling in <em>Dark Wolverine</em>. While the comic never confirmed the exact nature of their relationship, when a fan asked Marjorie Lu if Johnny and Daken were sleeping together, she replied with: "They better have been, given all the hard work we put into creating sexual tension between their characters."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">Hercules</a> was implied to have had relations with a large number of women and Northstar. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is Amadeus Cho repeatedly denying that he has the same relationship with Herc as Iolaus did. While armwrestling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thor2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thor2014">female Thor</a>, he also had a line of dialogue that suggested he'd kissed the original, male Thor in the past. In the <em>X-Treme X-Men</em> alternate universe, he's explicitly shown to be in a relationship with Wolverine, making both characters a little less ambiguous.
</li><li> Tony Stark aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>. (It also shows up in the movies he appears in). He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> and all of his canonical love interests have been women, but he also seems to have a thing for teasing/making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a> remarks towards male characters.
<ul><li> Not to mention the fact that he publicly apologizes to both men and women when his dating profile is taken down in the comics....and when it&#146;s put back up, it noticeably allows both men and women to send requests. There&#146;s also a party scene from the Superior Iron Man issue that displays a half-naked Tony surrounded by both men and women who are also in various states of undress &#151; while in his bedroom.
</li><li> It&#146;s taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by the Avengers Academy game, in which Tony does things like refer to Thor as sexy, call T&#146;Challa handsome to his face, tease Loki for hitting on him and compliment his hair, openly check out Captain Britain&#146;s biceps, and seems to have no problem with the concept of himself and Steve as a couple, all while still flirting incessantly with female characters like Pepper, Nadia Pym, and Natasha Romanoff.
</li><li> As far as the movie version goes, some of Tony&#146;s more obvious indicators include telling Hawkeye to &#147;clench up&#148; when he carries him with the Iron Man suit, patting Thor&#146;s biceps while complimenting his swing, joking about performance issues with Loki, asking his teammates as a whole (four out of five of which are male) if someone kissed him, and, of course, the ever-infamous &#147;America&#146;s ass&#148; scene (in which Tony, completely unprompted, calls attention to and comments on Steve&#146;s ass).
</li></ul></li><li> Kimber from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em> obviously had a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSexuality">Adaptational Sexuality</a>, but it's hard to tell if she's lesbian or bisexual. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> cartoon she's exclusively into boys (though her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a> with Stormer in "The Bands Break Up" makes her Ambiguously Bi in her own right). In the comic though, she leans towards girls. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmittenTeenageGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmittenTeenageGirl">interests outright includes "Girls"</a>, her sisters mention her frequently crushing on girls, and she falls in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> with Stormer. Some dialogue in early issues imply she could be bi, and considering her cartoon version that wouldn't be unusual. Though in the Valentine's Day issue she gets disgusted when she learned she kissed a man while under a spell, suggesting that she's gay.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyDeath">Lady Death</a> was originally as Evil Ernie's love interest and even then that didn't stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer">women being all over her</a>, despite saying she is not into them. However in the Avatar publications, while she prefers men, it's implied she swings both ways when she casually kisses a barmaid on the lips in one scene, though she treats it as nothing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>:

</li><li> "Girl Crush" by Little Big Town is about someone who is jealous of a woman because she's with the man she loves. She also sounds like she wants the object of her jealousy. She sings lyrics like "I want to taste her lips, yeah, 'cause she tastes like you", "I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume", and other romantic sounding lyrics about the woman she's jealous of.

In some songs ("Casimir Pulaski Day," for instance) he seems to be singing about a female love interest, in others ("The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades," "Drawn to the Blood") it's pretty clearly a man, and in a few ("Impossible Soul") it could go either&mdash;or both&mdash;ways. As Stevens has never spoken publicly about his sexuality, his fans tend to read into his lyrics whatever they want to see in them.

Also of note, her hatred of men apparently comes from her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGullible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGullible">gullible enough</a> to take something her marital arts teacher said as an obvious joke at face value (that being that coming into contact with men will weaken her strength). Obvious because said teacher <em>is a man</em>, which Tenko apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">did not realize</a> until Shuichi points it out, causing her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">Go Mad from the Revelation</a>.

<ul><li> During a news report in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HazbinHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HazbinHotel">Hazbin Hotel</a></em>, Tom Trench makes a joke about lusting for Cherri Bomb, who shows a lot of skin in her outfit as she appears in the footage. A short while afterwards, Charlie mentions Cherri Bomb's protege Angel Dust, and Tom Trench immediately recognizes Angel Dust as a porn star.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Charlie:</strong> Oh, just someone named... Angel Dust.

But he also once told Strong Bad he was "falling for him," seemed excited at the prospect of receiving a "deep tissue massage" from him, and also once proclaimed, about a celebrity, "He's positively dreamy!" (Said celebrity was a <em>sound effect,</em> but that's just the kind of show Homestar Runner is.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>:
<ul><li> More than once Yang has all-but flirted with Blake, winking at her while promising to dance and flirtatiously calling her "feisty" being some of the more prominent moments. However, when she first arrived in Beacon, she was also happy to be sleeping in the hall so she could check out all the boys. When Blake runs away after the fall of Beacon, Yang takes it extremely hard. In Volume 5, she breaks down in tears in front of Weiss, sobbing that she needs Blake.
</li><li> The official <em>RWBY</em> manga anthology <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RWBYOfficialMangaAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RWBYOfficialMangaAnthology">Red Like Roses</a></em> features Ruby/Weiss teasing, mostly on Weiss' side. One story has Ruby going on about how she wants a boyfriend. At the end of the chapter, she jokes that Weiss has a crush on her and gets real close to her. Weiss blushes and gets embarrassed at this. This might imply Weiss likes girls, on top of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with boys in the animation.

<ul><li> Kat has crushes on Alistair and Eglamore, her friendship with Annie has a lot of romantic tinges, and as of Chapter 42 she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dating Paz</span>. It's entirely probable that she's still discovering her sexuality, but bisexual seems the most likely.

<ul><li> Jake is likely bi to some degree, but there's enough ambiguity about his relationship with Dirk that he could still be exclusively straight.
</li><li> Caliborn is clearly interested in "the bitches", but also has quite a bit of a (one-sided) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush">Villainous Crush</a> on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dirk</span>, to the point of drawing fanart of the two of them being "more than friendly" together. (This being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist">Caliborn</a>, though, it's impossible to tell what he <em>actually</em> drew.)
</li><li> Rose is dating a girl, but is also fond of certain masculine literary figures and implies that she and Dave treated one another differently before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they found out they were brother and sister</span>.
</li><li> Post-retcon, the Vriskagram suggests that Dave and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karkat</span> might be in a romantic relationship. In his later conversation with John, Dave resists identifying as either exclusively straight or exclusively gay. He crosses out of this trope and into explicit bisexuality after asking Dirk for advice on how to come out to one's friends.
</li><li> Pre-retcon, Roxy had a staggering amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Calliope and at least a little with Jane; post-retcon, she spends about 5 lines constructing an elaborate description of how hot Jane is. On the other hand, she's expressed much more direct interest in both Dirk and John.
</li><li> Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">trolls</a> are only shown attracted to one gender or aren't shown in a relationship at all, but are assumed to be bisexual due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">that being the norm in troll society</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3">M&eacute;nage &agrave; 3</a></em> does this a lot, although over time it tends to settle down to making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">most (though not all) of its characters definitively bi</a>.
<ul><li> For example, DiDi, Sandra, Sonya and Gary have all claimed to be straight, but hinted at or dabbled in bisexuality at times from the first (DiDi and Sandra even went so far as to attempt lesbian sex with each other, only to conclude that they were really "two naked straight girls with poor boundary issues"); DiDi and Sonya are nowadays fully functionally bisexual.
</li><li> Also, Zii always held that Yuki was not a lesbian, she just didn't like penises due to a childhood trauma from the work left lying around the home by her father, a manga-artist who became famous as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">"The Tentacle King"</a> &mdash; and this now appears to be entirely correct.
</li><li> After it seemed that Sandra's heterosexuality had been confirmed by her attempt with DiDi, spinoff comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraOnTheRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraOnTheRocks">Sandra on the Rocks</a></em> had Cammi bring the trope racing back to the surface for her. And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">her tendency to grope other women when drunk</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Becoming a successful model does wonders for her confidence, and by the end she can comfortably flirt with women while sober. She officially ends the comic as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBi">But Not Too Bi</a> due to not wanting to put a label on her sexuality, and in the final strip, she confesses her love to Cammi and the two get together for real</span>. Also in that comic, teenage geek Alex seems increasingly ambiguous about his complete commitment to heterosexuality, especially after Sandra vomiting on him made him start to associate attractive women with vomit. However, the only "boy" he shows attraction to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver">is actually a girl in disguise</a>, and this subplot resolves itself off-camera during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> with him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">scoring a threesome with said girl and her girlfriend</span>.
</li><li> Another spinoff comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StickyDillyBuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StickyDillyBuns">Sticky Dilly Buns</a></em>, has Jerzy, who keeps insisting that bisexuality was a stage on the road to homosexuality for him. This might be more convincing if he didn't still sometimes have sex with women.
