It all depends on what kind of story is being told.
</p><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGoals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGoals">Reasons include:</a></strong>
</p><p></p><ol><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Avenge me</a>! The ghost was killed through foul play, knows it, and wants the murder avenged. Sometimes, this also comes with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">Clear My Name</a> sidebar. This one can also lead to ghosts becoming violent and angry if not avenged. They may explicitly say that they cannot rest easy in the graves until they are avenged.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a>: Something that was significant or important to the person they used to be when alive remains undone. The ghost hangs around until this is done, and may or may not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathAlwaysEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathAlwaysEnds">move on afterward</a>.
</li><li> The ghost hasn't yet figured out they're dead, or are so attached to what they did in life they are still doing it out of habit and/or affection. This can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a> shock or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a>.
</li><li> They're aware they're dead and angry at living people because they are still alive.
</li><li> That's just how the Afterlife works in this universe. No alternate dimension, Higher Plane of Existence or anything &mdash; you just become a ghost when you die.
</li><li> The ghost suffered so much in life that the spirit was drawn to the place where the worst torment took place.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMemory">Resounding psychic echo</a>. The ghost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">isn't even the person's soul</a>, but just a spectral imprint left behind by the person's death that's gained a form of sentience. In paranormal fields, these are usually called residual hauntings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>. They feel someone they love can't make it without them, or needs protection.
</li><li> No funeral, no grave &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">they cannot rest without proper memorialization</a> &mdash; or perhaps their graves have been moved or desecrated.
</li><li> Or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">someone is mourning them</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">too</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">much</a>, and as a consequence, they are bound to this world.
</li><li> The person who arranged for their burial was a beneficent stranger, and they must make return for this good deed. This type is the original "grateful dead".
</li><li> They were very, very naughty in life and fear crossing over to the Afterlife and facing possible cosmic retribution.
</li><li> They were very, very naughty in life and ghosthood <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">is</a></em> their cosmic retribution. If it's of a purgatorial type, sometimes humans can help out.
</li><li> They're a spirit form of some sorcerer, and actively made preparations to ensure themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">eternal life</a> after their bodies gave up, or just ended up that way because of their power.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarredFromTheAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarredFromTheAfterlife">They were magically prevented from going to</a>, or were magically drawn back from, the Afterlife.
</li><li> The boundaries between the realms of the living and dead have been weakened; this tends to bring about <em>lots</em> of ghosts. This can be a regular, normally annual, occurrence, in which case you just want to propitiate them, or indicate serious problems as a one-time thing.
</li><li> They can move on any time they want; they just don't want to because they're having too much fun.
</li><li> There's also the odd rare case of a ghost that was never a living human being. It may have spawned from something. It may be part of a broader species that's made of the same kind of "matter" as human ghosts. It may be an animal, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">Genius Loci</a>. It may be a synthetic ghost made by alchemy. In cartoon setting, a ghost child can be considered to be the son of a couple of "normal" ghosts, born after the two normal ghosts's death (this is mainly to have a young ghost spectators can identify to, without addressing the issue of a child's death). Or it may be some sort of... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">thing</a></em> pretending to be a ghost to suit its purposes.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a>: Some ghosts have strong psychological or even physical effects on the living. These may result from being in the presence of, seeing or hearing, or (generally the worst effects) <em>touching</em> the ghost. These effects may be temporary topermanannt, and may include:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever">Brain Fever</a>: Common in 19th century works. Sometimes fatal, sometimes survivable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch">Death Touch</a>: Has is own entry under "powers"on this page.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">Insanity</a>, of varying duration and severity.
</li><li> Tangible physical injuries, of varying severity, often caused by a touch. Sometimes all or part of these injuries become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">Wound That Will Not Heal</a>, ranging in severity.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch">Death Touch</a>: This is a <em>very</em> common ability for ghosts in stories written before the 20th century; it can still sometimes be seen in later works. The death may occur instantly, or the victims may linger for a time (rarely more than a matter of days), the better to gibber madly about the unutterable <em>horror</em> of what they saw (and in the process provide story significant clues). Variants include curses, life drains,and visual or acoustic ranged effects. Especially in 19th century works, death may come by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever">Brain Fever</a>, or extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer">Fear</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>: Some ghosts can take over the body of a living person and operate it like a puppet. For some ghosts, this is the next best thing to being alive again. For others, it's simply an expedient because they can't experience what their host is experiencing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker">Dream Walker</a>: Some ghosts can inject themselves into a living person's dreams. Usually this person is someone psi-gifted, though.
</li><li> Elemental powers are not uncommon.
<ul><li> Most commonly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Wind</a>.
</li><li> Sometimes they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a> powers too.
</li></ul></li><li> Equipment the ghost used in life may become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel">ectoplasmic version of same</a> that can hurt other ghosts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer">Fear</a>: One of the most common ghostly powers, and one almost universal for ghosts in stories written before the mid 20th century. As literal spirits of the dead, and metaphorical personifications of death itself, ghosts often induce unreasonable fear in anyone in their presence, above and beyond any <em>reasonable</em> fear they may induce. This often results in cowering, psychological paralysis, terror or even madness.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">Flight</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFloats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFloats">Levitation</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Not</a> necessarily limited to the ghost itself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a>: When ghosts do not look the same as when they were alive, they can often disguise themselves as such. However posing as a human will usually result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">slight flaws</a> in their facade, like lacking a pulse or cold skin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">Intangibility</a> or Phasing: The default state of ghosts tends to be intangible. They can touch and interact with physical objects if they concentrate on doing do (except in works which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">play up the toll on their sanity</a>), but they usually cannot pass on their intangibility to anything they are holding - typically, if they pass through solid matter while holding something, the solid matter remains behind after the ghost has passed through. This is most common in modern works; ghosts in older stories are more likely to be solid, and some can even pass for living humans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">Invisibility</a>: Some ghosts can choose whether they want to be visible to anybody. Others are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">visible only to the spiritually sensitive, or to people with close personal ties to the ghost</a>. Sometimes this is dependent on the ghost's power, with strong ghosts being easier to see than weak ones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a> for moving and throwing things around in a ghost tantrum/poltergeist fit.
<ul><li> Other times, they can project <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamerTrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamerTrailer">Scary Visions</a> into the mind of a victim.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>: Ghosts can sometimes morph into morbidly, gruesomely horrific, grotesque (or amusing) shapes to terrify their haunts. If their emotions flare, this effect may happen involuntarily.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a>: Some ghosts can create rain, thunder, lightning, high winds, even sleet or snow. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostAndMrsMuir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostAndMrsMuir">The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</a></em>, Mrs. Muir reveals that the Ghost can never fool her about his emotional state because the weather barometer always reveals his genuine mood.
</li></ul><p><strong>Limitations include:</strong>
</p><ul><li> Some ghosts are only able to show up between sundown and sunrise.
<ul><li> Others can only appear on certain days (nights); for single ghosts, this is often a significant date in their lives, but in masses, there is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalTime">Liminal Time</a> where ghosts walk because the boundaries between life and death are thin (which may also be year's end, or otherwise a boundary between times).
</li></ul></li><li> Some ghosts are unable to enter churches.
</li><li> Most ghosts are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">restricted to haunting a specific house</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter">object</a>. If you can leave the premises you're usually safe. Destroying said house or object will usually remove the ghosts' anchor to the material world and force it to move on, but it might just allow it to haunt anywhere it wants to.

A human being touching a ghost feels a slight chill while the ghost feels a cold and sharp pain. Ghosts themselves can interact physically with each other. While lacking psychic abilities, the ghosts are very good at reading facial and body language on account of lacking things like breathing to distract them. Lastly, the ghosts are prone to falling asleep for days at a time, especially after exerting the energy to physically manipulate things.

They can manifest physically to an extent that they are indistinguishable from the living, which can get really confusing. They can also be invisible but can still affect the physical world. Some ghosts (like Nora Montgomery) don't seem to realize they're ghosts, some ghosts (like Chad, Patrick, and Moira) do, and some (like Tate) seem to vary based on the situation. Moira is unique amongst <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStory">American Horror Story</a></em> ghosts in that she can drastically alter her appearance; to living heterosexual men she appears young and sexy like she did when she died, to others she is a middle-aged woman (who actually looks older than she probably would have had she not been murdered).
<ul><li> Ghosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryHotel">Hotel</a></em> are similar and expand on the rules.

Those of great evil will also become ghosts such as the various serial killers in the Hotel. Oh, and they're immune to certain forms of magic which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Queenie</span> discovered the hard way.
</li><li> Even if you weren't evil in life, becoming a ghost tends to make one somewhat amoral, with a tendency to scare living people at best and murder then at worst, including people who haven't done anything to deserve it. As Larry from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse">American Horror Story: Murder House</a></em> puts it, "they've got nothing to live for anymore", and they get bored.

</li><li> Gilbert.

For Annie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was her fiance killing her, which is solved when she drives him mad with a secret</span>). Once they are able to move on, a ghost sees a door appear and walks through it. If a ghost is upset enough, they can become a poltergeist and move or break things mentally. Also, all ghosts can't eat or drink, can randomly teleport, and are stuck in whatever clothes they died in ("It's just as well I didn't die in a Star Trek uniform or a giant squirrel costume..."). Ghosts can also hide the living or undead by wrapping them in their clothes, referred to as "swaddling".

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS">US/Canadian remake</a> has Sally Malik. She is intangible all the time and invisible to normal humans. She cannot interact with physical objects, but seems to be able to sit on objects (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">the production team made special wooden and concrete cushions for her to sit on, but they do not conform to her body</a>). When upset, she disrupts the electronics and pipes around her. While she is initially not able to leave the house she died in, she is later taught how to leave. Objects close to the ghost, such as Sally's engagement ring, will constantly find their way back to the owner. Salt will create a barrier that ghosts cannot cross, and iron will disperse a ghost's energy, causing it to reform in the location in which it died. A ghost passes on to the other side after resolving unfinished business. As with the British version, Sally's door does not appear until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she forces her fianc&eacute; Danny who killed her to admit to his crimes</span>. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has to pass up her door to save Aidan</span>. It is after this event that Sally discovers she can pick up and interact with physical objects. This also appears to be an ability that stronger ghosts exhibit, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as when Danny is able to hold the iron poker that Sally intended to disperse him with</span>. Ghosts can also possess humans, so long as the human is willing (or inebriated), and destroy each other, defined as "shredding".

</li><li> Specters, who are not so different from vengeful spirits, except they leave black ectoplasm instead of the usual green. They posses those who feel betrayed and carry on their vengance for them, though they must hold something haunted by them.
</li><li> Poltergeists, another type similar to a vengeful spirit, although unlike vengeful spirits poltergeists do not target people who committed crimes similar to how the spirit died, and are more indiscriminate.
</li><li> Shojo, a Japanese ghost/spirit, different from others in that it's tangible and alive, however similar to a ghost, it is invisible, and only those who are drunk can perceive them.
</li><li> Demons can also be considered ghosts since they are former human souls transformed by their stay in hell. Bobby said once they're nothing but ghosts with a an ego.

<ul><li> Dickie Lee's song "Laurie (Strange Things Happen)" is about a young man who picks up a girl who needs a ride. When he gets to her destination, the seat beside him is empty, though he never stopped the car. All that remains is her sweater. When he knocks on the door with the sweater to see if she went inside while he wasn't looking, the person who answers is astonished to see the sweater. It belonged to his daughter, who was killed in a car crash at about the spot where the young man picked up the hitcher girl... 25 years earlier. The song was inspired by the urban legend of the Vanishing Hitchhiker. The young man of the song takes Laurie back to her home, leaves, realizes he forgot the sweater he gave her to keep warm with, and goes back for it. The person at the house tells him "She died a year ago today" and that she's buried in the local cemetery. He goes there to look at her grave, and finds the sweater folded up on top of it. So, even truer to the Vanishing Hitchhiker legend. All made especially effective and actually creepy by the disarming early 60's (made in 1965) music that accompanies this telling. Not surprisingly, Dickie Lee was responsible for about three or so of the songs that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean">Don McLean</a> called "dirges in the dark" in American Pie &mdash; the song, not the movie series.

In Celine Dion's version, her late lover's ghost manifests first as shadows on the walls, and then in flashbacks within mirrors, his intangible presence only becoming visible near the end. In the Meatloaf/Marion Raven version, Marion's ephemeral ghost is visible to the audience all along, but her widower Meat only becomes aware of the haunting when objects start moving by themselves in his mansion, and doesn't seem to actually see her at all.

<ul><li> Catholics believe that the dead in Purgatory can visit living people to request prayers for purification; the living should never attempt to initiate this contact, and these souls are not the same as demons. By contrast, most Protestant churches believe that all ghosts are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons masquerading as the spirits of the dead</a>.
</li><li> Ghosts (usually referred to as revenants) from Medieval folklore are usually malevolent and decidedly physical, with there being stories of people wrestling with ghosts or ghosts being restrained until a priest can arrive and perform an exorcism.
</li><li> In Buddhism, ghosts are called <em>pretas</em>. They are people whose craving of something (be it food, sex, or money) was so strong they could not properly reincarnate, leaving them in a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> until they could build up enough good karma to reincarnate.

They fall into different categories based on how they died and who they were in life, but boil down to repeating actions over and over in a mindless, pathetic way. Mourners show up and crowd around dead bodies, snowfallen show up during snowstorms and sing prophetic warnings, etc.
</li><li> Then there are demons, human spirits that are entirely ego, who remain active and cognizant entirely through the force of their will and obsession. They are universally awful and dangerous because, even if their obsession is something noble, they will possess and destroy you to accomplish their goals. Add to that the fact that while they still think and feel, they're utterly lacking in the emotional depth that hormones give you, making them incapable of love or even basic empathy, and you have the nastiest creeps in the whole setting.

Eldar Wraith-constructs are the souls of dead Eldar given material form, and the robotic shells of the Necrons house the souls of the long-dead Necrontyr. Necrons Wraiths in particular drive the point home, being able to phase in and out of existence. Space Marine Dreadnoughts aren't technically dead, they're just the head and vertebrae of a 'mostly dead' Space Marine hero.

<ul><li> Ghosts are somewhat less elaborate than in the Old. Whether or not they are the human soul is deliberately unclear, but magic can bind a person's soul to an anchor and thus make it into a ghost. They have trouble communicating with mortals, and the specifics of their powers (Numina) vary from ghost to ghost. A ghost tied to its Anchors is basically a psychic echo of the actual human, unable to fully comprehend that they're dead and unable to change. Once the ghost is free of its Anchors and descends to the Underworld, however, it regains its sense of self and is able to change.

As a result, their human memories are fragmented, to say the least, but they gain access to the power sources of the Underworld and can make bargains to bring the mystically inclined back from the dead... as long as they get to come along as passengers.

<ul><li> The method of death showing up on the ghost has been removed. It's a kids' show.
</li><li> The Neitherworld, where Beetlejuice dwelled, was full of nonhuman ghostly entities.
</li><li> Beetlejuice himself was arguably an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> version, since he displayed all kinds of strange powers most other ghosts didn't seem to have.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a></em> is a complicated case. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, he was a boy who died of an illness, but in the comic books... it would seem that ghosts in the comicverse are one more Enchanted Forest species, not humans who die. The animated shorts do little to clarify, though one does involve a fox that Casper tried and failed to save becoming a ghost.
<ul><li> As for abilities, "Ghostly Powers" in the comics are kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">very consistent</a> and what they are is told often: they can fly, become invisible, or become intangible &mdash; all under the ghost's control. Occasionally, Casper encounters a "ghostproofed" wall or prison. What is inconsistent is which objects can be turned invisible or intangible along with the ghost: Spooky's hat <em>never</em> becomes invisible with him and has given him away many times, but Pearl's bow has changed with her sometimes and not others.
</li><li> The new cartoon <em>Casper's Scare School</em> has Casper and his uncles back to being ghosts that were never "fleshies".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> has a whole bushel of examples:
<ul><li> Overall, there are three main types of ghosts. 1) Ghosts of people/creatures who died, like Poindexter and Cujo. 2) A entity that was never living, but seems to be a unique life-form formed of ectoplasm, who can create races and even reproduce, such as the race of the "Far Frozen". 3) A concept or idea that has taken on conscious form. Clockwork is the ghostly form of Time, Vortex the manifestation of bad weather, etc. Half ghosts (Danny and Vlad) seem to be still-living humans with ectoplasm fused to their DNA in a similar vein as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>.
</li><li> Danny himself is a "half-ghost" and technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">never died</a>. So is Vlad Plasmius. And because she was created, so is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>, Dani Phantom.
<ul><li> Danny has the "Ghostly wail" which is a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">sonic attack</a>, effective on ghosts. This seems also to be a power particular to half-ghost/half-humans.
</li><li> Danny has the ghost sense (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Homage</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s spider sense), which turns out later to have been the precursor to his freezing power.
</li></ul></li><li> Ember McLain got power from the adulation of fans she never got in life.
</li><li> Desiree was obligated to grant wishes, though not always as the wisher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">would have preferred</a>.
</li><li> Sidney Poindexter was bullied in life so much that his spirit haunts a ghostly clone of Casper High circa 1955. Seeing people get bullied turns on his poltergeist rage. He once possessed Danny under the mistaken impression Danny was a bully.
</li><li> Ghosts in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">'verse</a> are capable of reproduction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Box Lunch is the future child of the Box Ghost and the Lunch Lady</span>.
</li><li> Possession is called "overshadowing" instead because it's a kids show. And for some reason, despite at least one common victim stating more than once that he hates being overshadowed, the concept of overshadowing people without their permission for no good reason being an immoral violation not befitting a hero is never, ever touched upon.
</li><li> Ghost animals:
<ul><li> The ghost puppy who got Danny in touch with Valerie could morph from cute puppy to vicious hound until Danny resolved his issue &mdash; he only wanted his squeaky toy.
</li><li> Vlad Masters has a hunting lodge. Every animal that appears as a trophy on the wall is a ghost animal under Vlad Plasmius' thrall. He also has ghost vultures.
</li><li> Youngblood has a ghost sidekick which could morph into an animal of its choice to fit whatever costume Youngblood was using at the time (Parrot for pirate, Horse for Cowboy).
</li><li> Wulf is a ghost <em>werewolf</em> who speaks broken <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage">Esperanto</a></em>.
</li><li> Every other ghost is made of ectoplasm and doesn't resemble any living or human being.
</li></ul></li><li> Nonhuman Ghosts:
<ul><li> Skulker is a weird little ghostly entity who does not appear to have ever been human; he wears a cybernetic suit.
</li><li> The ghosts who taught Danny to use his freezing power are all appear to be Yeti, or something similar.
</li><li> There's a ghost who is a plant and who controls them.
</li></ul></li><li> Ghost Gear:
<ul><li> There's a metal that harms ghosts or half-ghosts.
</li><li> Johnny 13 has a ghost motorcycle.
</li><li> Youngblood has a ghost pirate ship.
</li><li> Ember's ghost guitar would let her use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> based on what song she was playing.
</li><li> Skulker has a number of ghost traps, weapons and devices (with the weakness of being hackable by normal earth tech).
</li><li> Technus could literally be the ghost in the machine (which is not the same as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine">Ghost in the Machine</a> trope). Danny could as well.
</li><li> Jack and Maddie Fenton were able to invent and use (with varying degrees of success) devices that protected from ghosts or trapped them. The garage sale episode featured a lot of mundane stuff the family owned getting contaminated with ectoplasm.
</li><li> Enemy Freakshow has a staff with a gem on it that exerts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> on ghosts. Danny is only partially susceptible.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DudeThatsMyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DudeThatsMyGhost">Dude, That's My Ghost!</a></em>, the ghost of Billy Joe Cobra can twist his form into all kinds of shapes, and his ectoplasm can have bizarre effects on both living people and inanimate objects. He can also only be seen by someone if they are wearing one of his former possessions.
