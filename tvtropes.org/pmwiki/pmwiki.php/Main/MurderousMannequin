<ul><li> Anastasia Aldarismen of <em>Boundary Labyrinth and the Foreign Magician</em> uses animated faceless mannequins as servants in Chapters 28 &amp; 29. They're properly dressed as valets and maids, but they rip out of their clothes when she sends them into battle. Theodore destroys them with little effort.
</li><li> Adal is the main villain of Episode 19 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Devilman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Devilman">Devilman</a></em>. He's a demonic spider who takes possession of mannequins as if they were marionettes. Adal's mannequins can (drastically) shapeshift into a human's appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShadowKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShadowKnows">although their shadows don't change along</a>, and have an identity separate from the demon. For years, Adal's been replacing people in key positions with his mannequins, but they all burn up when Devilman kills him.
</li><li> The movie entry of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure">DokiDoki! PreCure</a></em> casts a trio of discarded objects as the villain's main forces. They are given life through the sound of the magical clarinet. The one female member of the group is Mannequin Carmine, a mannequin dressed in red and with a star drawn over her left eye. She's physically very strong and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">has a bigger form</a> with ribbons adding extra volume to her lower limbs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> during the Fighting Festival arc, Bickslow move his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">"babies"</a> inside some mannequins. While they don't become "alive", they can still float around, move and shoot laser beams at Gray.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em>, though it was a surprise. The heroes came upon a beautiful woman and her small doll, who were able to use strings to restrain and kill their enemies. One of them realized that the woman never bled, and so figured out instead of the woman making the doll talk, the doll was actually a little girl, using one of the magical artifacts to give the mannequin life. Cue tragic backstory.
</li><li> Episode 16 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories">Ghost Stories</a></em> deals with a haunted apartment complex. These days, the building is abandoned but for whatever the main spirit residing there throws at trespassers. One of the things the spirit can do is summon an army of rundown mannequins to go after its targets. Keiichirou and Hajime are captured by these mannequins and brought to the roof of the apartment complex.
</li><li> In Chapter 38 and Episode 33 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostSweeperMikami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostSweeperMikami">Ghost Sweeper Mikami</a></em>, a youkai takes a mannequin as body when for aesthetic reasons it's placed on a pentagram that under a certain angle of light completely throws off the feng shui of the store. The mannequin goes on the run, donning various disguises and turning whoever it can into non-living mannequins. (In the anime, it specifically targets the ghost sweepers.) Mikami manages to destroy it with Okinu's help.
</li><li> Episode 9 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick">Gosick</a></em> opens with Avril telling Kujo a horror story about a mannequin that invites people that stop by store window into the store after closing hours. She, or a spirit possessing the mannequin, then consumes the victim in the dressing room.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto">Junji Ito</a>'s "Headless Sculptures" there's an artist who makes headless mannequins because he wants people to appreciate the body language, not the face. Then his creations come to life, kill whoever they can, and place the victims' heads on their necks.
</li><li> In Episode 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IDInvaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IDInvaded">ID: Invaded</a></em>, the sniper in the Pyrotechnician's ID well is a faceless mannequin with a rifle. It's a figurative nobody, because it doesn't need to be anybody as long as it causes the destruction the Pyrotechnician craves.
</li><li> In Hideshi Hino's "The Mannequin Room", the son of a mannequin maker enters his father's workshop and by accident knocks over a little girl mannequin. That night, she attacks him while he sleeps and he smashes her head in in self-defense. The next night, he's attacked by hte other mannequins in the hallway. His baseball bat saves him once more there. The third night, he's attacks while he sleeps by all the broken mannequin parts and again he fights back. There is the question of how the mannequins got in his room or in the hallway, but it's left up in the air whether the mannequins truly attacked or the boy just imagined them doing so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NotLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NotLives">Not Lives</a></em>: The Queen of Puppet's forces comprise mainly of mannequins that kill anyone who uses a skill.

He also uses it to fight the Sailor Scouts until it's destroyed by Jupiter's Flower Hurricane attack. For comparison, in the manga Nephrite uses a shadow doppelganger instead of a mannequin in this scheme.
</li><li> In the episode "The Next Floor" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YamiShibai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YamiShibai">Yami Shibai</a></em>, a mannequin serves as the elevator girl of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellevator">hellevator</a> in a department store. She drops the victim-of-the-day off at a floor where he's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">left alone</a>" forever, as per his wish.

Victim du jour Will Parson got banished there by Rick to compete in a dating show otherwise populated exclusively by mannequins. He loses the first round of <em>Mannequin House</em> when Stiffanie doesn't give him a rose on account of him having facial detail. Will is taken away for "improvement", which entails the removal of his face, but he escapes. In order, he ends up on the sets of <em>Family Autopsy</em>, which has mannequins in the audience, <em>Chop'd</em>, where one other contestant is a mannequin, <em>America's Got Intestines</em>, uniquely without mannequins, and <em>Wealthy Family of Zombies</em>.

</li><li> There's a pulp comic called "Mannequin of Murder" (in <em>Witches Tales</em> #17, Harvey Comics, Feb 1953, pencils and inks by Manny Stallman) in which a guy invents a serum to freeze people into mannequins. This is intended as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> torture, but they eventually come back to zombie-esque life and kill their creator. Then they go back to posing, get shipped all over America, and start going on killing sprees after dark.
</li><li> In "When Darkness Falls!!", published in <em>Journey into Mystery</em> #69, a man is the only that notices the subtle movements of the wax mannequins of a men's clothing department. He chooses to remain after hours to investigate. As soon as he's alone, the mannequins move in to attack him, but he reveals himself to be one of them and berates them for their carelessness that could endanger all of them.

The couple's daughter, Natsuko, found out about the scheme and she too was murdered.

The mannequins have the likeness of him and his lost wife Elsa in their younger years. After transferring his own soul, Toulon's puppets realize he's tricked them and murder him. Carolyn gets away and in need of a new master, the puppets turn to the corpse Camille Kenney to put her soul in the female mannequin. Thus, Miss Camille is born as the new Puppet Master. This plot point gets ignored in the sequel films, but is continued on in the comics. There, Miss Camille ceases to be when Camille's soul is put in a puppet as the evil counterpart to Dr. Jenn's soul.

In this form, she's very strong, is able to teleport, can control people, and exhales a gas that turns living creatures into mannequins. Her main weakness is that she easily falls apart. The demon's modus operandi is to initiate contact as a "normal" animate mannequin, but as soon as her head gets knocked off the face becomes flat, featuring only a giant eye and a giant mouth. The demon is also able to telepathically control other mannequins (but, it seems, not humans turned into mannequins) and they may or may not gain similarly distorted faces.

For them there's only the carefree life, which sounds great to the miserable new store employee Bridgette. Being forcibly turned into a mannequin in the store that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMultiPurposeRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMultiPurposeRoom">doubles as an operating theater</a> is a little less up her alley. Worse, because she's uncooperative, the mannequins threaten to use her for spare parts. Circumstances get three of Bridgette's friend captured too. Fortunately, the mannequins' party life makes them easy to involve in playing a clapping game, through which they clap themselves apart. The episode does not address whether (all) the evil mannequins started out as mannequins or if they were once human.

<ul><li> Lee ran an ad in 1981 for their Genuine Jeans. It follows two mannequins flirting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a>-style and ends with the female mannequin winking at the camera when she says they're "100% real".
</li><li> In the 1990s, the Irish National Dairy Council produced a commercial in which one child asks another how many bones a body's got. The life-sized posing doll sitting next to them gets up to sing to them how a child's body has more bones than an adult's and that bones need calcium.
</li><li> Agent Provocateur ran an ad in 1995 in which a man passing by the store window gets turned on by a mannequin's pose and outfit. She comes to life and puts on a show for him until he pokes a hole in the glass with his junk, triggers the alarm, and has to run for it.
</li><li> In a Coca-Cola commercial from 1997, three male mannequins are standing in the store window while all kinds of events take place on the street, such as a car crash and a guy breathing fire. Being mannequins, they stay as they are until two kids drinking Coca-Cola walk by. Like weird goldfishes, the mannequins press their mouths against the glass to get a sip of the drink.
</li><li> Q100 radio ran an ad in 2001 in which a female and male mannequin come to life to dance when a nearby car blasts Q100.
</li><li> In 2003, Mercedes Benz ran two versions of the same commercial for the then-new W209 model. In the commercial, an entire street worth of mannequins dressed in black tie fashion gather around the Mercedes Benz W209 display to admire the car. A poor streetsweeper alone at work sees them and they see him and he pretends to have seen nothing and carries on.
</li><li> The 2004 <em>Urban Legend</em> ad by Levi's features a man who takes the last pair of jeans of a mannequin. The mannequin refuses to part with his jeans and stalks the man out of the store, through traffic, to his home. In the end, the man falls asleep on his couch and the mannequin enters, sight firmly fixed on his jeans.
</li><li> Mazda had a racy commercial in 2005 in which a man transports several female mannequins in his car to get them to his store. One of the mannequins gets excited from the car ride, gaining erect nipples and letting out a flirty giggle. An alternative version does away with the sexual aspect, but also with overt hints that the mannequin is alive.
</li><li> Broadway Home Floral &amp; Design ran a Christmas ad in 2007 in which a dress form becomes human after closing and plays around in the store. The commercial ends when she turns back into a dress form.

They act as celebrities with social media presence and the commercials depict them as sassing each other around while pointing out how affordable Old Navy is and poking fun at their own mannequin limitations and perks.
</li><li> Target in Australia ran an ad in 2012 in which all the mannequins in their stores come to life at night just to have fun. The watchman only notices their outfits are a little in disarray.
</li><li> Stayfree ran an ad in 2012 for the then-new Ultrathin version of their pads. The commercial laments how women don't have their full range of mobility if they don't wear the right pad and depicts them as mannequins at this time. Then one wears the new Ultrathin version and turns (back) into a normal human.
</li><li> In 2012, The Art Institutes created a commercial to showcase what heights students of theirs could reach. A mannequin wears a dress by Gustavo Cadile and tells about how it would've remained but a sketch if the designer had never studied the finer details of sewing or learned how to promote himself.

</li><li> Under the slogan "Everything comes to life at Hudson's Bay", Hudson's Bay ran a commercial in 2018 in which a male manequin in a small store gives in to his curiosity and visits the recently opened Hudson's Bay across the street. Inside, he meets a female mannequin and they have a blast together until he has to return to his own store the next morning. The store owner is confused why his mannequin has a lipstick print on his cheek.

They talk as humans do, but aren't shown moving and when knocked over lay stiff as a mannequin instead of crumpled like a human. The characters of interest do not see the mannequins as anything other than human. The mannequins can be considered symbolic of the human, a modern girl, who became the bakaneko.

As it turns out, Mannequa isn't resentful of Coaty moving on while she has ended up on scrapheap, but she has come to tell her old friend something she didn't consider important while she was the only one to wear Coaty: there's a pin stuck in its collar that could prick Coaty's wearer.

<ul><li> The <em>Black Magic</em> #13 story "A Rag - A Bone and a Hank of Hair!" tells of Marcus Jagger, a middle-aged tailor who regrets never having gotten married. He gets an order to make a dress for a female magician and dusts off his previously unused tailor's dummy for it. Once the dress is picked up, the dummy is left in the corner where it gathers dust, gets oil spilled on it, and is rained on through the open window. Come winter and Marcus cranks up the heat from the radiator the dummy is slumped against, which ignites life into it. That night, the radiator fails and the dummy instinctively looks for another source of heat, for which it wraps itself tightly around the sleeping Marcus. He suffocates and the dummy dies too because it no longer has a heat source to maintain its fragile spark.
</li><li> In a reimagining of "A Rag - A Bone and a Hank of Hair!", <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrotherPowerTheGeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrotherPowerTheGeek">Brother Power The Geek</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> is a living tailor's dummy that's also a supercivilian possessing immense strength and agility. He began existence as a normal tailor's dummy, of cloth held up by metal wires, that was left behind when the store closed down. Hippies made the abandoned store their home. One day, they are attacked by bikers and one hippie places his wet and bloody clothes on the dummy to prevent them from shrinking while drying. He also spills some oil on the dummy in the process. All of these ingredients allow a bolt of lightning to bring the dummy to life some time thereafter. His first act is to save the hippies from another attack, for which they name him Brother Power. "The Geek" is a title referring to his pseudo-humanity and he doesn't like to be called that. Brother Power is a proponent of the hippie philosophy (but not necessarily lifestyle) and doesn't actively seek out wrongs to right, but he also never walks away when someone needs help, even if helping comes with risks.
</li><li> In "Dugan and the Dummy", published in <em>Journey into Mystery</em> #18, Dugan is a Trimble's Department Store worker known for his aggression towards male mannequins and his obsession with a female one he calls Isabella. One day, he starts a fight with a male mannequin in full view of a crowd outside the store window, and in front of that very same crowd is stabbed by the mannequin. The police dismisses the witness statements as nonsense, but they have no explanation as to why Dugan's corpse itself is a mannequin.
</li><li> In the comic "Halloween Scene", published in <em>Scary Tales</em> #7, a woman is locked in a store with a werewolf. As the werewolf corners the woman in the window display, she falls over, alerting two watchmen. As it turns out, the woman and the werewolf are both mannequins and part of a Halloween display. For the entirety of Halloween night, they've been enacting the same scenario over and over with no memory or knowledge of what they truly are. Each time it ends with the woman mannequin falling over and starts with the watchmen restoring the display. And, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">horrible as it is for the woman mannequin</a>, there's still a few more hours until tomorrow.

When she's being pushed into marrying a cruel tailor, Otto tries to kill him to save her, but is murdered himself. The tailor marries Helga and immediately starts the abuse. Helga's only happiness comes from one of her husband's old tailor's dummies, which looks remarkably like Otto. Then the abuse escalates into a murder attempt and Otto's spirit possesses the tailor's dummy to save Helga. Helga happily spends the rest of her life with the dummy as companion, knowing it watches over her.
</li><li> "The Wax People!", published in <em>Strange Tales</em> #93, is upfront about toying with the reader's expectations. While the mannequins surely are alive, this is because the events take place on Xaccus and not Earth. Xaccus's population are the wax people and some have a job as mannequins.
</li><li> Sue the Magic Manikin, also known as Sacony Sue, is a 1950s promotional character for Sacony that has two comics to her name.

He's having a great time until at dawn the party dissolves and he freezes near the windows, having become a mannequin just like his new friends.

Then their owners return, put them in the trash, and bring in a newer set of discarded mannequins. The new mannequins are loud party animals and when the old group returns to reclaim their home it takes mere seconds for a brawl to break out. The end result is that the heavily damaged mannequins repair themselves with each other's parts and other junk lying around, thus fusing the two groups and allowing peaceful coexistence to return to the building.

They always try to get her to buy something, but not aggressively so. When Rebecca finally learns not to buy everything that catches her fancy, she imagines the mannequins clapping for her.
</li><li> Two children who daydream about the same superhero, Rem Lezar, join forces to make him real in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatingRemLezar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatingRemLezar">Creating Rem Lezar</a></em>. They do this by dressing a mannequin up as him and, once they sit down next to him, he does come to life, but only for a day unless they can find the Quixotic Medallion to keep Rem Lezar in the real world. They succeed and wake up next to the lifeless mannequin back where their adventure started, but the promise isn't broken. They now each have a piece of the medallion, the police officer that finds them looks suspiciously like Rem Lezar, and the spiritual Rem Lezar now can always visit them.
</li><li> In <em>The Doll</em> (also known as <em>Vaxdockan</em>), a lonely night watchman takes a liking to a mannequin and steals it to be his companion. At first, he knows she's a doll, but as time passes he imagines her coming to life. Their happiness sours when she grows to want more freedom and he refuses because he's afraid he'll lose her. Through circumstances, the other tenants find out about the mannequin partner and he tries to make amends by introducing her to them. She, however, keeps still as mannequins are wont to do. In anger, he smashes the "deceitful" figure, loads the pieces in a suitcase, and throws the suitcase in a river. His relief is short-lived, for when he gets home she's there all conjured up by his mental state. She coolly lets him know that she can't die as he long as he doesn't.
</li><li> The second dream of <em>Dreams That Money Can Buy</em> is "The Girl with the Prefabricated Heart". It tells the tale of a stunning but vapid mannequin (possibly a robotic mannequin) named Julie, who rejects her literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">One True Love</a> because his want for affection messes with her flair. Two other mannequins help her get away from him, whereupon he dies.
</li><li> After hitting her head in <em>Holly's Holiday</em>, Holly awakens to find the gorgeous male mannequin whose window she passes daily standing over her, alive and charming and all. She and the mannequin, Bo, start up a relationship in which he becomes increasingly more controlling. One thing he does is invite his parents, who used to be catalogue mannequins, over for a surprise visit and tell them all about his vision for the relationship. Upon realizing how unhappy she is, Holly breaks up with Bo and shortly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">truly awakens</a> from her blackout.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mannequin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mannequin">Mannequin</a></em> is Ema "Emmy" Hesire, the spirit of an Ancient Egyptian woman who prayed to the gods to escape an arranged marriage and find love in another place and time. Throughout the centuries, Emmy serves as a spiritual muse to artists and she gets to inhabit the art made into her likeness as long as only the artist is around. Her latest match is Jonathan Switcher, who remakes her into a mannequin as an odd job that fulfills his artistic aspirations. The two grow close and Jonathan ends up risking his life to save her current body from being destroyed, thus gifting Emmy true love and allowing her to stay human permanently.
</li><li> The store clerk Philomena in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMomForChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMomForChristmas">A Mom For Christmas</a></em> knows that the mannequins with faces are alive to some degree and works hard to save as many as she can when the store decides to replace them with faceless ones. One mannequin, Amy, gets a shot when the half-orphan Jessica wishes for a mother for Christmas Eve. Amy and Jessica get along great and Amy also develops a relation with Jim, Jessica's father. Jessica wants Amy to stay forever, but Philomena can't grant that wish: it's Jessica and Jim who must hold on to Amy with their hands and hearts on Christmas Eve for her to stay. Of course, the ritual succeeds.
</li><li> In the 1935 short <em>Two Hearts in Wax Time</em>, the department store employee Joe draws the ire of his colleagues by coming into work drunk for the umpteenth time.

<ul><li> In the "The Dummy That Lived" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L. Frank Baum</a>, a fairy named Tanko-Mankie pulls a cruel prank in which they bring a mannequin to life by breathing on her forehead and then leaving her without guidance just to see what chaos follows. The mannequin can talk, reason, and walk, but those are the only skills she has that separate her from a newborn. She wears clothes and accessories because she saw the women gawking at her do that, but the clothes she picks don't match. She sits down at a cafe and orders coffee 'n' rolls because she sees another person do that, but the coffee burns her waxen and wooden body and she walks off without knowing she's supposed to pay. When a man raises his hat in greeting, she copies the greeting unaware of the gender association. Eventually, she's hit by a car and the huge hole in her head positively identifies her as a living dummy. She's taken to the police station, where Tanko-Mankie takes her life away the moment no one's looking.

They immediately set out to do whatever they want, disregarding the fact none of them is supposed to be alive and that things will get awkward when the store opens. The huntress enacts her display's scenario by hunting a stuffed fox on horseback throughout the store. The copper finally gets to be authorative and use his nightstick. The drinking gentleman sets out to get something to drink instead of being stuck pretending to pour himself one. And so on. Hugo and Judy can't wrangle them despite their best attempts, so they resort to flipping the switch that seemingly brought the manikins to life in hopes it de-lives them. It works, and the manikins are left standing in whatever poses were their last.

He fancies the mannequin Courtney and wants her to be alive. Roarke invokes the myth of Pygmalion and gives Francis a talisman of Aphrodite to channel the goddess's life-granting power. Courtney's love matches Francis's, but she is woefully naive of the human experience. Among others, she tells other guests that she was born at Bloomingdale's, that she's six years old, and makes it sound like she has a disconcertingly active sex life. At a fashion show on the island, she finds three friends of hers on display: Mindy, Sally, and Sybil. Courtney uses the talisman to bring her friends to life too. Francis takes care of the lot of them, earning their affection when he promises he'll take them to his next job and not let them be thrown out in favor of the new, faceless models. Soon enough, the weekend ends and the mannequins revert to a lifeless state. Francis is happy to have had even a short time with Courtney, and he's even happier when Roarke introduces him to Ms. Wilson, ostensibly the woman Courtney's form was modeled after.

She tries to give him another partner by bringing Justin's rare Calico Woman doll to life (and making her human-sized), but Manny only has eyes for her. The problem resolves itself when Manny volunteers for a dunk tank and goes under, because water undoes the magic.

As luck would have, there's a strike going on so many mannequins can make it to the ball this year. They mingle and share their fears of being thrown away as beauty standards change, share their frustration over having only one night for themselves, share their sorrow over missing parts, and so on. The party is disrupted when a human, the leader of the socialist workers' party, drops in in pursuit of a female mannequin he mistook for a pretty woman. His head is cut off with a giant pair of scissors to keep the mannequins' secret safe. A headless mannequin claims the head for himself and takes a chance to visit the humans' ball some blocks over. He's mistaken for the labor leader and bribed all night until the headless body of the real labor leader crashes the party to get his property back. Tired of humans, the mannequin gladly returns the head and leaps out of the window to escape.

They are actually NPCs coded to not act on any script. However, sometimes the code not to act doesn't load fast enough and they walk off their pedestals before being frozen on the spot, wherever that may be in the house. It's also possible to make the code not load at all and thus for the mannequins to act like normal NPCs. Giving the bug more in-game credence, the mannequins are NPCs whose race is set to "mannequin" to give them their wooden appearance. Setrace in consolecommands allows the mannequins' race to be changed to any other and, for that matter, to turn any other NPCs into mannequins.

</li><li> In the <em>Goofy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Disney</a> short "How to Dance", George Geef gets a dress form to serve as his practice dancing partner. For the most part, it's a regular dress form, but she does get drunk after a cup of punch.
</li><li> In the <em>Family Guy</em> episode "Hefty Shades of Gray", Chris remarks that he likes the look of a headless lingerie mannequin. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scene</a>, it's revealed that Chris took the mannequin home with him to use as sex doll. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a>, it stares forlornly out of the window when Chris leaves on a date with Kristen. Thereafter, it resorts to looking up porn on Chris's laptop.
</li><li> There are two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Merrie Melodies</a> shorts that feature mannequins and one mannequin in particular as the title screen character. The shorts are "A Great Big Bunch of You" and "We're in the Money", with the latter potentially being a prequel to the former.
<ul><li> In "A Great Big Bunch of You", a male mannequin just brought to the dump brightens up his lot by playing music. Other mannequins and dress forms, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue">bust</a> and other discarded items join him.
</li><li> In "We're in the Money", many objects within the department store come to life at night when the guard goes home. Among them are several mannequins, of which one leads the final third of the nighttime merrimaking.
</li></ul></li><li> While the Mane Five are sharing scary stories in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E15ScareMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E15ScareMaster">Scare Master</a>", Rarity offers the tale of the mannequin that came to life at night to haunt the costumes. To Rainbow Dash's annoyance, that's the extent of the tale.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PickleAndPeanut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PickleAndPeanut">Pickle and Peanut</a></em> episode "Movie Camp Out", the mall's mannequin folk become active at night to drink from the fountain, eat trash and pizza, care for the auto-buffers, train standing still, be silent, and be fashionable. They explain to Pickle that eons ago their ancestors fled to the mall to evade taxes and ugly people; a story the veracity of which Pickle questions but doesn't pursue. Peanut steals the pizza vending machine to buy himself a good spot in line for <em>Night Hog 3</em>, provoking the mannequins into war against the nerdy moviegoers. Once they discover this is all about <em>Night Hog 3</em>, they reveal they already snuck into the theater to watch it, spoil the plot twist, and go in to watch it a second time as the angry nerds retreat.
</li><li> Xipe of "In Your Own Skin" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VictorAndValentino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VictorAndValentino">Victor and Valentino</a></em> is a probably-god-definitely-fashion-designer. During the song "In Your Own Skin", his mannequins and outfits are his backup dancers.

<ul><li> There's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> regarding a bride mannequin dubbed La Pascualita. It began when in 1930, shortly after the death of her daughter, Pascuala Esparza put a new mannequin in the store window of her bridal boutique in Chihuahua, Mexico. The mannequin is very detailed and carries a resemblance to Esparza's daughter, which caused the locals to speculate the mannequin was actually the daughter's embalmed corpse. About a century later, that particular rumor has lost its conviction because corpses can't be kept in pristine condition for so long. But the secondary rumor, that the mannequin is possessed by the daughter's spirit and moves around at night, has not been negated by time.
</li><li> In 1932, Lester Gaba created a remarkable life-like plaster model for Saks Fifth Avenue, that would become known as Cynthia. Cynthia became the subject of a <em>Life Magazine</em> shoot to show off how advanced the art of mannequin making had become. From there, the mannequin became a true celebrity, receiving invitations, fan mail, gifts, promotional gifts, subscriptions, and hosting both a newspaper column and a radio show. Cynthia's popularity survived her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a> (she broke from a fall, but was repaired), but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, during which Gaba served in the army. Attempts were made to put her back in the spotlight in the '50s, but it didn't work because the glamor days she was part of were over.
