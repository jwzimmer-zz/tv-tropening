<p>A crime has been committed, usually a murder. In the subsequent investigation, Bob seems to be going out of his way to <em>make</em> himself a suspect. He may confess right at the start, or just draw attention to himself by refusing to co-operate with the investigators, even when it would appear to be in his interests to do so. Or he may not make himself known immediately, but will suddenly show up at the cop shop two-thirds of the way through, ready to confess, even though he's never been a suspect. Why? Because he's Taking The Heat for Alice.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In a classical whodunnit, it will usually turn out that Alice is innocent after all, and Bob was acting on a misapprehension. (Whether Alice is more flattered by Bob's care or offended that he was able to think she'd done it will vary from case to case.) Some authors have gone for the double-whammy, where Bob tries to take the heat for Alice while Alice tries to take the heat for Bob, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">and in fact, neither did it</a>. Another variation is for the actual perpetrator to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">offer a deliberately implausible confession</a> so that everybody <em>thinks</em> that he's taking the heat for somebody else.
</p><p>In more "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">cynical</a>" series, it may instead turn out that Alice did indeed do it, but Bob has some reason for feeling she should be spared punishment: Alice can't handle prison, Alice has less than a year to live, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">victim</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">raped</a> Alice and only Bob knows, Alice has a degenerative brain disorder and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacsAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacsAreInnocent">doesn't know</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacsAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacsAreInnocent">she did it</a>... and sometimes, Bob may actually think he's protecting an innocent Alice - all while she's pulling his strings to get him to take the heat for her.

<ul><li> Attempted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aya Misaki</span> in the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother">Dear Brother</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Manipulated by two elder Sorority girls, Aya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a> Megumi and Miyuki steal and almost burn the signature books requesting for the dissolution of the Sorority. Aya takes the blame for her friends when they're confronted, saying that <em>she</em> ordered for the books to be destroyed; but after she leaves the school, the girls reveal what truly happened to Kaoru, Junko, Nanako, and Tomoko.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> The trope is featured in Heiji's first appearance, which involves the murder of a famous diplomat named Isao Tsujimura. When Heiji claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Isao's father Toshimitsu</span> is the killer, said character confesses <em>despite not being the culprit</em>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinichi (as in <em>himself</em>, not Conan-as-Kogoro)</span> has to bail them out. Their real intention is to invoke the trope, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">20 years ago Toshimitsu had helped his son with a cruel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a>, so he wants to atone as an apology to the persons who were affected by it.</span>
</li><li> A two-part episode featured Shougo Soumei, the president of a small-time entertainment company, who was having some problems with the TV station's manager Raisaku Nakame; he had been extorting him, and then wound up dead as the result of poison. Shougo was discovered to have hidden some evidence, then tried to take the rap for the crime until Conan-via-Kogoro revealed the true culprit... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It was his office assistant, Maiko Kozumi. The two loved each other, though neither had confessed their feelings to the other yet. Maiko murdered Nakame because she knew he was causing problems for Shougo; she then called Shougo, told him what she did, gave him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>... and threw herself off a window. Poor Shougo was so shattered by this that he put Maiko's body in the trunk of his car, hid the evidence that she had committed the crime, and got ready to take the blame in order to preserve his beloved Maiko's good name. However, Conan had deduced this much as well, revealed the whole deal through Kogoro, and Shougo ended up going free.</span>
</li><li> Another example from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Night Baron Virus</span> case: Ran thought that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Satoshi, the karate champion she fangirled upon</span> was the murderer, but he was planting evidence <em>against himself</em> to divert attention from the true killer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> girlfriend, Akiko, who killed the victim in revenge for having driven her beloved brother to kill himself. Satoshi <em>was</em> arrested too, but <em>because</em> he took the heat for Akiko.</span>
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> case features Ran's mother Eri as the lawyer of a guy named Shinji Usami. Shinji's been accused of beating a guy to death while in a drunken rage, but Eri is firmly convinced that he's innocent and he's doing this for the real killer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She's right: Shinji saw his ex-wife Masako kill the victim as revenge since he had caused the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring">their little son Masaki</a>, so he willingly took the blame to protect her.</span>
</li><li> In another case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady">Office Lady</a> Fumie Ozawa took the heat for herself <em>and</em> her boyfriend/partner in crime Ryouta Shimizu, who had embezzled a very large sum of money. Ryouta realized that Fumie would spend the rest of her life in jail for the two, so he killed her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">to spare her from such a terrible fate</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:

</li><li> Hayate also took responsibility for the Wolkenritter's crimes, partially to protect them and partially because she felt responsible (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">the only reason they attacked people was that they were trying to save her life</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kyosuke takes the heat for Kirino's H-Games when their dad found out.

</li><li> He does it again to help patch Kirino and her friend, Ayase's, friendship after the latter found out about her hobby. Really, this seems to be his plan A.

She is freed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">but prison warps with her mind a bit.</a>

He sees himself as unimportant and believes that social issues cannot be resolved unless all parties focus on a single enemy, which in this case, is Hachiman himself. It works the first time around, but his second attempt causes a rift between himself and Yukino and Yui, who feel disdain for his method of operation.

He turns out to have been taking the heat for his wife: the guy had a terminal illness and the doctor had conned the couple out of their savings with a quack treatment involving leeches leading the wife to shoot her. He wanted to be sent to jail in her place seeing as he didn't have long to live.
</li><li> In another episode Mac asks a man coming out of prison why he took the blame for a crime he didn't commit, while the man insists he accidentally ran over a girl on a bicycle after having several drinks when celebrating that night. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He and his daughter were celebrating her becoming a doctor, and she had several wine glasses when she got behind the wheel of her car and ran over the victim. Not wanting her career and her life, to be ruined, he told her to let him take the blame.</span>

As he's being taken away, Columbo, who knows the truth, gently points out that the evidence will eventually show he didn't do it. The confessor agrees but figures it would probably take about six months or so for that to happen.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeenEddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeenEddie">Keen Eddie</a></em> episode "Black Like Me", the character Georgie turns himself in and confesses to a jewel heist. Eddie refuses to believe that Georgie is a criminal and figures out that the girl Georgie loves asked him to take the fall, so she and her real boyfriend, a murderous crook, can get away with it.

Neither was guilty, but because both had a reason to want the victim dead and weren't looking in the right direction at the moment the murder occurred, they each believed the other was responsible until Fraser learned about and captured the actual killer.
</li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGlades">The Glades</a></em>, a potential suspect, who otherwise denies the crime and has the potential for a good alibi, immediately confesses to the murder when he finds out they have DNA of the killer and all they have to do is test him to have conclusive evidence. Jim immediately believes the confession is false and done to prevent any DNA comparison, because enough people have seen forensics on TV to know that DNA can show people are related, in this case showing that the man didn't commit the crime but a close blood relative (his son) did.

</li><li> In another episode, a person of interest confesses to the murder, but is tripped up when Beckett asks him about some details of the case that he gets completely wrong. He was doing it to protect his girlfriend who was being framed.
</li><li> In "Like Father Like Daughter", Alexis tries to prove that Frank Henson, a man convicted of murder 15 years ago and scheduled to be executed in three days, is innocent of the crime. She and Castle ultimately discover that Frank had confessed to the crime to protect his brother John, whom he saw standing over the body. Alexis and her father prove that both Frank and John were innocent, and Frank is exonerated.

She almost goes to prison, but Earl sees that Darnell and the kids are already starting to suffer without her. So even though he didn't do it (although he did help Joy try and cover it up), and even though he knows he'll lose his newly-acquired job, apartment, and girlfriend, Earl says that he did it and that his fingerprints are all over the truck (which they are). He goes to prison for most of Season 3.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> sees this happen several times, as members of a drug organization take the heat so that their higher-ups will remain free and able to run their criminal organizations, most notably with the Barksdale Organization.
<ul><li> D'Angelo is on the verge of making a deal with the police until at the last moment his mother Brianna convinces him to take some of the heat the police are trying to pin on Avon, whose criminal activities provide for his entire family. Later, after D'Angelo is assassinated in prison on Stringer's orders, McNulty calls Brianna out on this in one of the most devastating ways possible.
</li><li> Arguably the most notable case though, is another one from the first season. Wee-Bey Brice, the main assassin of the Barksdale crew, is caught and offered a plea deal: he'll avoid death row if he confesses to all the murders he committed on behalf of the Barksdales. Wee-Bey immediately starts confessing to every single murder ever committed on the Barksdale Organization's orders, even ones that both the audience and the police know he didn't commit so that as much of the Barksdale group as possible will remain free and able to carry on with business.
</li><li> When the Stanfield gang is arrested at the end of season 5, their main assassin Chris Partlow, as part of a plea deal cut by Rhonda Pearlman, pleads guilty to all murders committed by the crew so long as his family is taken care of, similar to Wee-Bey.

</li><li> In "Brother's Keeper", Detective Watts confesses to killing a man in self-defence, but Murdoch doesn't think things add up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As he learns more of Watts's connections to the victim, a sadistic gang leader who tortured and killed Watts's adoptive brother and was released because Watts himself was guilty of evidence tampering, he starts to suspect the murder was premeditated, before realising Watts is protecting the <em>other</em> brother. And he didn't do it either; he was going to but couldn't go through with it, and was murdered himself in the same way as his brother. The guy was killed by his own father, who witnessed this and finally realised the accusations were true, then Watts found the body and jumped to conclusions.</span>

</li><li> In "Family Ties", Vance's daughter Kayla gets arrested for shoplifting a purse. In reality, one of her friends committed the crime, but Kayla covered for her because the friend in question has gotten into trouble with the law before and another offense would have ruined her chances of getting into college, especially since she had recently turned eighteen. Kayla, on the other hand, is still underaged, has early acceptance into Georgetown University, and has an otherwise clean record, meaning she only gets legally punished with having to do 30 hours of community service and the "theft" won't go on her permanent record.

Another character, who is about to make a break for England, offers to leave behind a letter confessing to the murder since he's determined to make it or die trying so either way the Germans won't be able to do anything to him. At the end of the episode, the German commander receives the letter and immediately recognizes it for what it is, but seems to be considering accepting it at face value so the situation may be smoothed over; the episode ends without revealing his decision.

<ul><li> More "Claiming the Credit" than "Taking the Heat", but part of ISIS' M.O. is to claim that lone-wolf terrorists were members of ISIS.
<ul><li> Although in this case, ISIS considers anyone who declares to fight on their behalf as part of ISIS regardless of whether they ever were in direct contact with the group. Basic ISIS ideology considers that you don't have to actually be connected with them previously to be considered a member as long as your attack was declared to be part of their struggle.
