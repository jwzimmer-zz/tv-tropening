This can happen at any point in a story, but happens so frequently at the end that we have tropes devoted specifically for that situation.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em> gives us one with the pirate villain Dorza Baroy in Episode 17. Witz manages to defeat the pirate by firing shots on his ship at the end of the episode. The room of the ship Dorza is in takes damage, looking like it is about to explode. One crew member panics and says that they won't make it, while Dorza say "Damn, is this the end?!" The shot cuts away to Garrod destroying three of their mobile suit soldiers that were hiding in the water, and then we see that Dorza's ship has been wrecked, but not completely destroyed and is floating in the ocean. We don't see any rescue boats sailing away, but there is no way to tell is Dorza died or not, and he is never seen again for the rest of the anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arachnid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arachnid">Arachnid</a></em> introduces the protagonist of the <em>Caterpillar</em> prequel midway through the story only to have her defeated from a backstab soon after. The scene plays out in such a way that the readers couldn't tell for sure if she actually died and then the story completely forgets about her. Furthermore, most of the characters are left for dead by the end of the series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Japan is put through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> spread through rape, with the goal of depopulating the country once all the mindless infected die from starvation. Other than Gokiburi and Kabutomushi the fate of everyone else is left unknown, with a few like Dinoponera, Geji and Kamadouma having been unceremoniously infected offscreen. Even main character Alice was last seen charging alone against the zombie hordes to vent off the stress from all the trauma she endured through the story.</span>
</li><li> In the grand finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em>, the crew destroys NME's fortress with the NME Salesman still inside and, upon being informed of this, he makes a run for it. In the original Japanese version, he can be heard screaming just before the fortress is entirely destroyed but what makes it qualify for this trope is the English version, which doesn't dub his scream at all and leaves him silent. In both versions, King Dedede attempts to contact him and only gets a static screen in return.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> a few of the characters who are only in one arc and who didn't join Gut's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">party</a> or go the Griffith's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia">Falconia</a> are classified as this.
<ul><li> Theresia from the <em>Black Swordsmen arc</em> swore revenge on Guts for getting her monster father killed- but she has never been seen again. More tragically Jill in the <em>Lost Children arc</em> has to return to her abusive home life as Guts refused to let her go with him as she would be in danger, but since the entire world of Berserk is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">dangerous</a> if she didn't travel to Falconia she'd likely be killed by the numerous creatures that roam wild.
</li><li> Nina and Joachim from the <em>Conviction arc</em> they survived the destruction of Albion and went off alone together to make themselves better people, unfortunately we don't see them in Falconia and as said above there are monsters everywhere so their chances of survival are minimal (especially as Nina was already dying).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em>: In the anime, Nadare the deer survives being shot by his human friend and limps his way back to the forest. The episode ends with the other characters wondering whether Nadare was Killed Offscreen.

<ul><li> Harribel gets captured when the Wandenreich invades Hueco Mundo, and is never seen again, even after they are defeated. It was only in the light novels released later that would reveal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was rescued and resumed leadership of Hueco Mundo</span>.
</li><li> Cang Du and BG9 receive punishment from Jugram for losing in their fights. Jugram is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> Cang's abilities and kill or at least badly injure him, but the scene cuts away before we see what happens to BG9. Neither are mentioned again following this.
</li><li> At the end of their fight with Askin, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Urahara and Yoruichi</span> are apparently unable to escape when their opponent unleashes a final "Gift Ball" on them. While Nel is seen trying to rescue them, they are never mentioned in the ending. Like the Harribel example, it was up to the light novels to reveal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nel rescued them.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BurstAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BurstAngel">Burst Angel</a></em>: Jo's body wasn't found by Meg in the rubble at the end of the anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> ends with Spike collapsing from his injuries, but it's left unclear whether he died or simply passed out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CyborgKurochan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CyborgKurochan">Cyborg Kurochan</a></em> often uses this for minor one-off villains. For major characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a> is used instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Monster Carrot and the Rabbit mob, after defeating them Goku takes them to the moon via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff">Power Pole</a> and forces them to make Mochi for the kids of Earth for a whole year and then he promises he come up and bring them down. However Master Roshi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destroyed the moon</a> in the World Martial Arts Tournament to revert Goku from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla">Great Ape</a>. So fans assumed they were killed, but then Toriyama (when asked) states that Monster Carrot and his henchmen are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSpaceDrifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSpaceDrifting">drifting through space</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EsOtherwise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EsOtherwise">E's Otherwise</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kai Kudo</span> is not seen alive or dead after the explosion in the final episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a> FINAL</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The entire crew, minus Mamoru and Kaido, is left in a collapsing universe, sacrificing their only (known) way out to save the kids.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> Part 3 does this with some of the Stand users. While some are confirmed dead (including Gray Fly, Fake Capatin Tennille, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla">Forever</a>, Devo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">J. Geil</a>, Pet Shop, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Vanilla Ice</a>), some are confirmed alive (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Mannish Boy</a>, Boingo and Oingo, Mariah, and Hol Horse), and there are some whose fate are uncomfirmed. Among those whose fates are uncomfirmed, there are two of them who are highly implied to be dead as they don't get up. They are Steely Dan (whose been punched even more times than Forever and did not get up) and Rubber Soul.
</li><li> A lot of villains from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaiketsuZorro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaiketsuZorro">Kaiketsu Zorro</a></em> get this treatment because there's no doubt that Zorro won't hesitate to cut down the villains who attack him. But whether or not he outright kills them or just wounds them badly enough to incapacitate them is left in the air. In some episodes, Zorro does explicitly kill his enemies, such as the time he slew an Indian assassin who murdered his friend Teo and had found out about his secret identity earlier. At other times Zorro will cut down enemies but either ties them up or drags their prone bodies away from impending explosions, implying that he hasn't killed them and will more than likely leave them to the authorities to imprison. More than often, though, Zorro will usually cut down a villain and their deaths will be neither confirmed nor denied, making the situation much more ambiguous.

<ul><li> Axe-Hand Morgan, the former Marine captain, was thought to be killed by Zoro by one fan until Oda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">corrected him</a> by saying he was arrested. Morgan appeared in Coby's cover story where he escaped and then he was never seen again.
</li><li> Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates (with the exception of Jango) are also nowhere to be seen after Luffy defeats Kuro and they flee Usopp's village. The anime shows Kuro having returned to his pirate life and reacting dispassionately to Luffy's first bounty poster.
</li><li> Don Krieg, Gin and the other Krieg Pirates don't appear again after the Baratie arc. The arc involved Gin breathing in a lethal dose of poisonous gas and telling Sanji he might have not have long to live but he hoped to see him again on the Grand Line... which didn't happen.
</li><li> The Arlong Pirates' fate is left very ambiguous. The anime mistakenly has Arlong accuse Zoro and Sanji of "killing his brethren" after they defeat Hatchan and Kuroobi.

Shura was blasted by Wiper's Reject Dial to the chest and Ohm was sliced down by Zoro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind">Pound Cannon</a> and (like Satori) didn't get up again. Even if they survived that, the Shandians banished them and the rest of Enel's forces to a drifting cloud, which means they will stay on this cloud until they all die or the cloud dissolves and fall down into Blue Sea (which would kill them as well).
</li><li> Yorki, Brook's friend and captain was not killed along with the rest of the Rumbar Pirates as he had fallen ill prior and was last reported traveling across the Calm Belt (which is filled with Sea Kings) and even if he crossed safely that was 90 years ago.

Dumblodore implies that he will be sent back to Azkaban, but Crouch Jr. never appears alongside other Death Eaters in subsquent films.

Alternatively, he could be killed offscreen in some other way.

Because all the crusaders start dying of thirst and exhaustion, their army is annihilated and Raynald and Guy de Lusignan are taken captive. It is unclear if the Grand Master died with crusaders, as he was not seen being taken captive as well.

In the finished movie, it's still <em>possible</em> that the Thing got him, but it's also possible he was killed in the explosion or even that he's still alive somewhere at the end of the movie.
