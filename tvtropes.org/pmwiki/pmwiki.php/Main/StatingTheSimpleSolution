<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Sanji's first wanted poster is a comically crude sketch of his face. The pirate Duval, who happens to look just like the sketch, keeps getting into fights because people constantly mistake him for Sanji thanks to the wanted poster. Eventually, Duval tracks Sanji down to get revenge for all the trouble he's been put through. When Sanji asks Duval why he didn't just change his appearance somehow (like getting a haircut), Duval takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">a moment to think</a> before he admits that he never thought of that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> King Cold advises his son Frieza that revenge would be easier by just blowing up the Earth from space. Frieza rejects this notion, stating that he wants to see Goku suffer. One episode later, both Frieza <em>and</em> Cold are killed by Trunks.
</li><li> After being warned from the future that in three years, two androids built by Dr. Gero will murder all of them, Bulma does this when she suggests simply finding out where Dr. Gero is and killing him before he activates the androids. She's promptly shot down because Goku and Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">like the sound of the challenge</a> these androids will bring. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">In some versions</a>, Krillin also tells her in secret that it's best to give former villains Piccolo and Vegeta a mutual enemy. Goku also suggests that since Dr. Gero hasn't built the androids yet, it would be tantamount to killing an innocent person, which he doesn't want to do (of course, he's forgetting that Gero was the lead scientist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil">Red Ribbon Army</a>, and so most of their tech was probably built by him). Vegeta, meanwhile, says that even by the time they found Dr. Gero, it would be too late.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#145;F&#146;</a></em> and the subsequent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> adaptation; after being revived, Frieza announces his plan for revenge against Goku. Tagoma, one of his minions, speaks out against it, telling him that he could just go back to ruling his empire in space with Goku and the Z-Fighters never the wiser. In response, Frieza either kills him on the spot (<em>Resurrection 'F</em>') or uses him as his personal training dummy for four months (<em>Super</em>).
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series, Staff Officer Black insists to Commander Red that they're no match for Goku and the smartest thing to do is simply to let him have the Dragon Balls, escape while they can, and rebuild the Red Ribbon Army later. Of course, after killing Red and taking over the army for himself, Black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">refuses to take his own advice</a> and tries to beat Goku using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>.

Both of them are severely injured and weakened, and Shishio's 15 minute-time limit for fighting has elapsed. Yumi (Shishio's lover) and Houji (Shishio's right-hand man) are watching, and Houji has a rifle. Yumi asks Houji why he just doesn't shoot Kenshin... Houji <em>throws his gun away</em>, on the grounds of his belief that Lord Shishio will win. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> offers a non-fatal version: when Lelouch learns that his best friend is the pilot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that's thwarted him at every turn, his partner C.C. asks why he doesn't just use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Geass</a> to make said friend join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a>. She guesses that it's either pride, sentimentality, or distaste for robbing another person of their free will; Lelouch responds that it's all three.
</li><li> At the climax of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeFirstEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeFirstEpisode">Non-Indicative First Episode</a> (filming a movie) of <em>The Melancholy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, Nagato confronts Itsuki, who refuses to join forces with her. Nagato's shoulder-mounted <em>cat</em> suddenly starts <em>talking</em>, asking why she doesn't just use <em>mind control</em> on the guy already, since judging by what she's shown so far it ought to be well within her powers. But that's not in the script, so after a scramble to <em>shut him up</em> Nagato has her final battle with Mikuru.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> inverts the trope &mdash; ("No, you can't just shoot him!") &mdash; when S&#333;suke is challenged to a no-holds-barred martial arts battle and, after being warned by his opponent not to pull any punches, calmly shoots the guy with a rubber bullet. Once it's explained to him that using a gun isn't allowed, he repeats the performance with his next opponent by gassing him with a fire extinguisher &mdash; and when it's <em>further</em> explained to him that he's supposed to be fighting <em>solely</em> hand-to-hand, he downs his third opponent via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyCatch">Hey, Catch!</a> with a grenade followed by several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attacks</a>, explaining afterwards that the pin was still in the grenade, and clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">never quite grasping the concept of a "fair fight" at all</a>.

Ed and Ling are discussing how best to attack the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Ling seems to think it's a better idea to take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> first since their enemy clearly outmatches them. Edward would rather go to the point. They share this exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ling:</strong> Haven't you heard the saying, "if you want to shoot the leader, first aim for his horse"?! <br><strong>Edward:</strong> If you want to shoot the leader, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">then you should just SHOOT HIM</a>!! <br><strong>Ling:</strong> <em>(thinking)</em> Is he stupid...?

Big Boss' idiot nephew Beserko suggests they <em>pay the tickets</em> and ask the police to leave since they no longer have any reason to be there. He is glared into silence by the rest of the gang, which then tries to drive the C.O.P.S. off with brute force, which results in the police grounds to arrest them for owning illegal weaponry and attacking the police.

When Wax discovers a civilization that created armbands that can grant powers to anyone, he asks why they seek the Bands if they can just strap thirty-two armbands to someone, and is politely told that they can't. The vast majority of Allomancers and Feruchemists only have one power, and powers from different people interfere with each other. Wearing two armbands does nothing, and scientists only recently discovered how to put four peoples' powers in one band. The Bands can grant all thirty-two powers because they were made by someone who had thirty-two powers, which is vanishingly rare.

O'Neill doesn't actually <em>say</em> anything, he just removes a couple of grenades from his equipment, pulls the pins, and drops them down the shaft.

</li><li> In the episode "Wormhole X-Treme!", O'Neill is acting as the military advisor to Martin's TV show, and when the question is brought up of "How can they defeat the giant alien without being weightless?", O'Neill says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?</a>", and is commended for his innovative thinking.

The Jem'Hadar contingent left in control of the ship is led by the arrogant first of a new batch of clones with a seasoned veteran of an older generation as his second-in-command. The veteran brings this trope up repeatedly to his superior, saying that the value of the crew helping with repairs is surely outweighed by the fact that they're no doubt scheming of a way to take back control of the ship (because he's smart enough to know that's exactly what he would do in their place), but he's ignored. At the end of the episode, Sisko lampshades this, telling the dying veteran "Your leader should have listened to you."

One naive young man suggests finding an actual horse and counting the teeth but is shouted down because the monks believe scientific questions are properly answered by consulting old authorities, not by empirical methods. The anecdote, which serves to ridicule the medieval "scholasticist" approach to science, is of dubious truth value and may be no older than the 20th century.
</li><li> There's an urban legend that goes as follows: When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat the problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface, and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to 300 degrees Celsius. The Russians used a pencil. However, this isn't at all true, as both Russia and the US knew beforehand that pens wouldn't work in space and instead used pencils. When pencils proved to be hazardous in space due to graphite dust and debris, the US switched to felt pens while Russia switched to grease pencils on plastic tablets. Eventually, a private entrepreneur independently developed the space pen with $1 million of his own funds, and sold them to NASA <em>and</em> Russia for $3 each.
</li><li> A crew transporting a house had difficulties with an overpass that their payload was 3 and a half inches too tall to fit under. They were standing there, scratching their heads, debating how to find an alternate route, when a kid on a bicycle who was doing his morning newspaper route asked what was up, he said, "Why not just let some air out of the tires and then re-inflate them after you've passed under the bridge?" A few minutes later, the crew were on their way again. This is in fact an extremely common solution to the problem - with the proviso that, unless you're very close to clearing the overpass while your tires are fully inflated, it won't help. Deflate your tires and you'll ruin them by the time you clear the overpass which would cost thousands of dollars to replace, to say nothing of if you damage the wheels themselves. Oversize load routing is intricately planned to avoid such eventualities.
</li><li> A joke is told about a driver who gets a flat tire just outside the fence of a mental asylum. Nervous about being stopped in such a place, he quickly starts to change the tire, putting the nuts in the hubcap while he wrestles the spare on. He then accidentally kicks the hubcap and the nuts fly out, disappearing into the tall grass beside the road. Suddenly, he hears a voice: an inmate watching him from just inside the fence tells him to take one nut from each of the other three wheels and use those, and that should serve to hold the spare in place long enough for him to get to a garage and replace them.

Meanwhile, Riot latches onto an elderly woman in Malaysia and spends six months aimlessly wandering around before latching onto a young girl who is about to fly to America. The young girl then somehow gets into the secure lab so that Riot can bond with Drake.</span> The screenwriter even says that it will probably be the "least fun" part of the movie but he needed to somehow get everyone into their positions so that the plot could get going in earnest. The Producer points out that he could eliminate the need to do all that legwork by simply having Venom be the one who escapes at the beginning.

Tax records indicated those who possess the wealth and resources to create his technology (the number drops to <em>3</em>).

<div class="indent"><strong>WordGirl:</strong> So, you're stealing gold, then transforming it into potato salad? <br><strong>Dr. Two-Brains:</strong> Mmm-hmm! <br><strong>WordGirl:</strong> Then you're taking that potato salad and transforming it into cheese? <br><strong>Dr. Two-Brains:</strong> Right. <br><strong>WordGirl:</strong> Doesn't that seem a little unnecessarily difficult? I mean, why not steal potato salad instead of gold? <br><strong>Dr. Two-Brains:</strong> Huh? <br><strong>WordGirl:</strong> Or use the gold to buy the potato salad. Or, why not just steal cheese in the first place? <br><strong>Dr. Two-Brains:</strong> Oh... boy. Seems obvious when you say it that way, but... but I have my reasons!

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller">Penn Jillette</a> has stated that the Greatest E-mail he ever sent from a text-to-impact ratio was when he was one of the few who proofread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>' <em>The God Delusion</em> before publication. He came to a part of the manuscript when Dawkins quoted an American hater of his calling him "a cheese eater!", and Dawkins then spent two-and-a-half page trying to deconstruct how being a cheese eater could be a bad thing, where cheese was manufactured in America and if there was some correlation with that area and atheism. Penn's immediate realisation and comment?

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> is credited with using a variant of "Why don't I just shoot him?" on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em>, as he was suffering from food poisoning and wasn't up for filming a long fight sequence against a swordsman. The resulting moment - Indy pulls out his gun and just shoots the swordsman dead - became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a> for the <em>Indiana Jones</em> franchise and firmly established Indy as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>. It also frustrated the actor playing the swordsman who had spent a lot of time learning the fight choreography only to see his big scene reduced to a 10-second joke.
</li><li> From the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>: "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j61kIL334X8">Why don't I just zap them?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" "Be-because your batteries are low. You can't get any AA's in the city. You've tried, but... gone to every chemist in the city but none of them have AA batteries."
</li><li> A Non-verbal example of this comes from the writings of Simplicius of Cilica, regarding an Ancient Greek philosophical debate. One of Zeno's Paradoxes states that it's actually impossible to leave a room, since first you have to cross half the distance to the door, then half that distance, then half <em>that</em> distance, etc., getting very close but never actually being able to leave (Greek Mathematics didn't have the concept of zero). While other logicians proposed more intricate responses to the paradox, Diogenes of Sinope (appropriately, one of the founders of Cynic philosophy) simply <em>stood up and walked out of the room</em>. Strictly speaking, not the correct way to refute a Logical Paradox, but it's hard to argue with the result. One interpretation is that the paradox was meant to show that reality is an illusion since one can physically appear to do what is logically impossible.
</li><li> In the lead-up to World War II, a visiting British politician asked Hitler how he thought the English should respond to the situation in India. Hitler's advice: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">"Shoot Gandhi."</a>
</li><li> The NSA scandal in 2013 has made many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorists</a> believe that the government can spy on anyone at any time through the internet. Those who state the simple solution that debunks this - it's rather easy to unplug the computer - are often scorned.
<ul><li> Related to this is the manner in which computers that have to really be secure are protected from hackers: not by ridiculously sophisticated protection software, but simply not having the ability to connect to the Internet wirelessly.
</li><li> The only data transfer method that can't be remotely hacked is physically taking the hard drive to the location.
</li><li> For added security against hackers using webcams to spy on people, many webcams come with manual shutters or physical switches to disconnect them. And if you don't have those, you can just put a piece of tape over the lens, like former FBI director James Comey admitted to doing. It doesn't matter how good a hacker is if there's something physically blocking their view so that can't see through the camera.
</li></ul></li><li> It was once stated that if the moon landing was a hoax, the cover-up would be so enormously complex that, in the end, it would be easier just to land on the moon. Not to mention that while we actually did have the technology to land on the moon in 1969, we didn't yet have the technology to realistically fake it.
