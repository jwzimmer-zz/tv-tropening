The characters might as well not even attempt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>, because all the civilians around them know who they are and what they are up to. And that super-secret bit of gossip that no one can ever know? Hate to tell you this, but <em>everyone knows it already</em>. But at the core of the trope, is the fact that even though everyone is fully aware everyone else knows about the secret, it will still be treated as a secret; no one will ever openly admit to knowing it, and it is a common understanding that it should remain unspoken. Sometimes the occasional knowingly wink and nod will be shared, at most vague allusions or euphemisms might be used, but any and all open discussion and acknowledgment of the secret is completely out of the question. To do so will be viewed a mild faux pas at best, and an outright cardinal sin at worst. As a result, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Na&iuml;ve Newcomer</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> will often mistake it for an actual secret, as they don't know that most people already know. In smaller social circles, a common variant is "everyone knows, but they don't know how many other people know until they start comparing notes one day", at which point the real secret is that it isn't one.

Everybody in the town knows about it, and most carnivores use it, however, everybody collectively acts as if they knew nothing about it, with the exception being carnivores talking with each other, and Sebun mentions that a carnivore telling her about the market is something she never experienced, and everybody just pretends that the enforcing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore">Vegetarian Carnivore</a> rules are working. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis attempting to bring up the subject in live broadcast apparently breaks general rules of what the town's media can talk.</span>

She comes home to find Tenma also preparing her a party.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, it seems that Ed has "I performed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">a human transmutation</a>" written on his shirt.

While his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">automail arm and leg</a> aren't much of a clue (lots of people have automail, and it's implied that some people even replace fully functional limbs with it), the fact that his brother is a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a> tends to be a dead give-away that they have crossed a line never meant to be crossed.

When the characters discuss this, they talk in hushed voices and try not to let it get out. Yet, by episode 10, everyone seems to know, including the Acca employee who meets Jean when he comes to audit that incredibly secluded desert district.

Some assume he also knows already, but the Senate especially are hell-bent on keeping the truth from him.
</li><li> The fact that His Majesty often comes to the laboratory to enjoy himself while inventing or just talking to Jasmin or Lante seems to be an open secret everyone keeps from Legna as Legna has a reputation as a joy killer.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>, the fact that Lala is an alien is treated like this for quite a while, as everyone either already knows, or doesn't care when they find out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> a law exists that forbids anyone revealing that the titular character is the vessel of the Nine-Tailed Fox. While this means that Naruto's generation and those younger are ignorant of the Nine-Tails, every person able to remember the attack knows about it. The secret becomes even more open in <em>Shippuden</em> where several members of Naruto's generation openly discuss the matter. As of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fourth Ninja World War</span> it is officially not a secret anymore. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Part of the coalition's main objectives is to protect Naruto (and Killer Bee)</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, Quattro's real identity as Char. Not only would the audience not be fooled (the same character design, the visible scar, the same voice actor) but the fact that he flies around in a custom red Rick Dias shows that he isn't exactly keeping a low profile. It even gets lampshaded when he officially reveals his identity&#133;

</li><li> The use of Nen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter &times; Hunter</a></em>, the setting's effective magic system, is supposedly a secret known only to people who belong to circles that are in on it and seem to be subtly taught to hunters once they pass the Hunter Exams. However, it is also openly publicized in an arena tower that not only seems to televise the fights between powerful Nen users, also have commentators explaining what the contestants are doing in the Arena with their Nen&#133; to a large public. It gets to a point that the only main character that should realistically be ignorant about Nen is Gon, for growing up on an isolated and morose island in the middle of nowhere. Killua should know about Nen just by osmosis from his heavy Nen-practicing family of world-famous assassins, Kurapika's deceased clan is implied to be formed of powerful Nen users as well (otherwise they wouldn't register on Nobunaga's memory. Even Uvo eventually remembers the clan and its powerful members) and Leorio's general world and history knowledge should make him aware of it as well (even if just by passing knowledge about the Celestial Arena).
</li><li> The fact that Akina's an otaku is an open secret among her classmates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinozakisanKiWoOtaShikaNi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinozakisanKiWoOtaShikaNi">Don't Become an Otaku, Shinozaki-san!</a></em>. She thinks she keeps it hidden but everyone in her class is well aware, as shown when several girls try to awkwardly strike up a conversation with her but back off because they aren't sure how to talk to an otaku. Akina's old middle school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a> are also quick to realize that she has a major crush on Kaede, another thing Akina thinks she's hidden.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em>: Everybody knows that Rock is Duke Red's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, even though there are no official links between the two. Pero even name-drops this trope when discussing it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>, Kuromaru does his best to hide the fact that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a>, but he doesn't exactly do a good job of hiding it. Furthermore, it's implied that the fact is listed in his UQ Holder file and isn't that difficult to access. Basically, the only person who isn't aware of the fact is Touta.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>: As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/StrikersSoundStageX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/StrikersSoundStageX">StrikerS Sound Stage X</a></em> when Runessa tried to access certain information, most of the details behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Jail Scaglietti incident</a> are a military secret, including the fact that Vivio is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneJesus">clone of the last Sankt Kaiser</a>.

What she doesn't seem to realize is that though she appears to be an ordinary human to adults and cameras, her fellow students can see right through her disguise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em>: The assistants try to keep the fact that they are working for Nozaki a secret, sometimes even from each other. Nozaki himself does not hide the fact that he is the shoujo mangaka Yumeno nor does he think that his assistants should keep their affiliations with him a secret. He is actually very open about his profession, but the majority of his classmates do not believe him.
</li><li> In early volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma &frac12;</a></em>, Ranma tries to keep secret the fact that he transforms into a girl when doused with cold water, mostly from his fellow students at school. (His father and the Tendos know all about it.) At some point, the secret just disappears, and everyone knows about it and doesn't care much. (Except for the particularly oblivious and denial-worthy. Looking at you, Kunou.)

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s secret identity is like this sometimes, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Marvel</a>. In one issue, Daredevil (not in costume, of course) walked up to him, at school, to recruit him for a mission. In another issue, the Human Torch and Iceman showed up at school mostly because they were bored (Iceman: "Hey, aren't you&mdash;" Peter: "Don't you dare."). And finally, Kong &mdash; a jock who deduced it on his own &mdash; tells Peter to go help a friend, and when Peter looks ambivalent, he mocks him. "What do you want me to say? Should we have a code? Should I just throw up my hands and say 'Oh, if only Spider-Man were here...'!?" This was lampshaded, parodied and subverted in one issue when he's knocked unconscious and wakes up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Mansion</a> without his mask (they wanted to make sure he was OK); upon learning this, Peter engages in a very long rant about how he's trying to keep a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> here and is getting a bit sick of everyone somehow knowing that he's Peter Parker... only for them to point out that while they knew what he looked like, until <em>now</em> they didn't know <em>his name</em>. Oops.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>'s "secret identity" as Oliver Queen. Between his not-particularly-concealing mask and incredibly distinctive facial hair, anyone who's met them both will know that it's him. It doesn't help that Green Arrow is one of the more politically outspoken heroes, which means even his stated philosophies line up with Oliver's. In one case a policeman working with Green Arrow came to his house and, on being asked how he knew his identity, hadn't even known it was supposed to be a secret. His to-be sidekick Mia also recognized him instantly, not least because he was claiming to be a good friend of the Green Arrow. The best he could hope for is people thinking he's got a twin.
</li><li> In his own book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a></em>, Patch is actively concealing the fact that he is, in fact, the title superhero while he is operating in "deep cover" in Madripoor. Of course, all of his contacts know he is Wolverine, though they chose not to reveal this. They figured it is best not to delve too deeply into the private affairs of a walking blender. Not to mention the fact that the "Patch" persona adopted by Wolverine is SUCH a good disguise that apparently all Wolverine needs for this is, you guessed it, an eyepatch. Clearly, NO-ONE (I'm looking at you, Superman) can figure out his identity, save pretty much everyone.
</li><li> When the Human Torch of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>, a character whom the in-universe public knows as Johnny Storm, got his own ongoing feature in <em>Strange Tales</em> starting in issue #101, he maintained a secret identity in his home town of Glenville &mdash; the inhabitants of which knew his sister Sue was the Invisible Girl, but ostensibly don't know who the Torch was (the four schoolmates who do know who he is are now out-of-town graduates who were sworn to secrecy). #106 had him discover that everyone knew who he really is, after all, they just respected his privacy.
</li><li> One story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> centered partly around a country superhero called Roustabout. It was blatantly obvious that he was one of the guys working for a traveling fair, and everybody in town knew it but acted as if it was a complete mystery. They do this because Roustabout is technically a fugitive (he got his powers trespassing on the secret research lab of an evil corporation, and they offered a reward for his arrest) and they like and respect him too much to turn him in. The viewpoint character of the story, a city girl staying with her aunt, considers turning him in, but then realizes something else about him: given that everyone in town knows who he is and haven't done so, what would they do to someone who <em>did</em> try to turn him in?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em>: During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>' run, Matt Murdock's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> was outed. Although the accusation was "officially" fought back, since then <em>everyone</em> knows or at least heavily suspects Matt Murdock is Daredevil, so much so that he had to cease practicing law himself due to the fodder it supplied the opposing counsel. By the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a>'s run, even Matt himself has stopped caring and he just waves off people saying he's Daredevil with a halfhearted "I'm not Daredevil" that nobody buys. He still can't represent anyone, so he gives legal counsel to people so they can represent themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a> was originally just a marketing nickname, as she was known as Spider-Woman in her own reality. Later, her secret identity is outed, and she spends a year in jail. Upon release, she discovers that Spider-Gwen merchandise exists &mdash; she's stuck with the name. Any attempt to correct people fails, prompting her to decide she needs a new name. During Spider-Geddon, Miles Morales, thinking she'd been killed, asked if she was a ghost. This inspired her ne codename, Ghost-Spider, though the name is pretty much redundant with her secret identity no longer a secret.
</li><li> In comics where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> is treated as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>, his existence is often this. There's a giant spotlight that gets shined in the sky, major criminals find their way into police hands, many people have seen him, you can see people wearing Batman costumes and merch, and pretty much every superhero has either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">worked with him or worked with someone who's worked with him</a>. This sometimes gets some mocking, such as in <em>Young Justice</em>, where Robin keeps trying to "hide in the shadows" in broad daylight while insisting he's a myth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>'s nature as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a>'s most notorious rival falls into this, in stories leaning on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> aspect. Pretty much everyone knows that Luthor dislikes Superman, and that any military contract he gets will go haywire and target Superman, and that he's publicly battled Superman a time or two while "under mind control", and that Superman himself has spoken poorly of Luthor, but Luthor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">manages to cover his tracks just enough to save himself in criminal court</a>. One of the comics leading into Luthor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a> run had Luthor go into a restaurant and find that the menu included a number of Superman-based items and one incredibly disgusting Luthor one.

Nobody wants to come right out and say it, because Lancelot is "the best knight that is on life" and would challenge anyone who dared bring it up to trial by combat, in which he would slaughter them. That no one dares do more than hinting about it obliquely allows King Arthur to officially pretend he doesn't know about it for quite some time. In the fourth book <em>Candle in the Wind</em>, Mordred's scheming finally makes it impossible for Arthur to keep up the charade and he has to officially charge Lancelot and Guenevere with High Treason in the new courts, ironically set up by Arthur himself because he didn't like how trial by combat meant the person who could afford to hire the biggest, strongest fighter as a champion got to basically do whatever he wanted.

This is made much more clear in the Third Season episode "The Prom", during which Buffy is given the "Class Protector" award. Jonathan mentions while he's presenting that everyone present knows that Sunnydale isn't like other schools, but it's an unwritten rule that no-one ever talks about it. She won the award because the class mortality rate was the lowest in school history!

They seem to have worked out some kind of deal (referenced a few times but never seen onscreen) that they'll try not to profile one another, but they're not very good at keeping it, and mostly just compromise by politely pretending not to know things they're not supposed to know. One particularly notable example is Reid's drug problem in Season 2. He meets a friend outside the group who figures out what's going on in about fifteen seconds.

<ul><li> Lord Renly and Ser Loras' relationship is theoretically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">secret</a> given that the setting is based on the middle ages where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">homosexuality wasn't exactly approved of</a>, but not only does nearly the whole court, (including Renly's wife Margaery Tyrell) know about it, even a couple of random Lannister soldiers halfway across Westeros from them were joking about Loras "stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead!" in one episode. Considering that Renly's marriage to Margaery was never officially consumated and Loras is often seen entering his tent at nighttime, they really shouldn't have been surprised. This continues even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Renly's death</span>. It's revealed in Season 3 that Jaime, Cersei, Joffrey, Tywin, and Tyrion are also aware of Renly's sexual orientation. The Tyrells are a very powerful family that can easily shift the balance of power in the kingdom, so anyone with any political savvy avoids discussing Loras Tyrell's sexual preferences. Joffrey makes a massive political faux pas when he publicly brings up Renly's homosexuality. Everyone knows about it, but only someone as thoughtless as Joffrey would bring it up in the presence of the Tyrells.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jaime:</strong> It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks... They'd have never got him off it.
</div></li><li> On the same token, much of the nobility of Westeros seems to be aware, or at the very least <em>suspicious,</em> that Queen Cersei is having an affair with her twin brother, and that her children are illegitimate bastards born from the incest. Except for King Robert and the twins' father Lord Tywin, all of the smarter members of the court &#151; Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle &#151; have for a long time known for sure but kept it to themselves for their own plots and benefit. However, few people are actually willing to directly challenge Cersei on the matter because of her political allies. Ned Stark learns this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">the hard way</a>. Stannis Baratheon "outs" their secret when he receives Ned's missive, and it quickly catches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfMouth">Word Of Mouth</a> with the commonfolk at King's Landing and different parts of the kingdom, though whether people believed it is another matter. Olenna Tyrell, who's marrying her granddaughter to the Crown, points out to Tywin Lannister that the evidence is very convincing. As of "A Man Without Honour" in the second season, even Jaime and Cersei have given up denying it. As Season 4 rolls, it is the worst kept secret of Westeros and is only tolerated for political necessity and convenience, with everyone making snarky comments about it and the rumor having spread all the way across the Narrow Sea to Essos. Only Tywin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">refuses to acknowledge the truth even to himself</a>, and his denial is suggested to be because he point blank <em>does not want to believe it</em> since it would mean that his whole legacy and the Lannister blood claim to the throne is built on a lie. Even when Cersei herself tells Tywin outright that it's true, he refuses to believe it.
</li><li> Lampshaded in season 8 when the truth about Jon's parentage gets around. When Varys is told and learns that he's the <em>eighth</em> to know, he remarks that at that point it's not really a keepable secret anymore and will soon be common knowledge.

While it certainly isn't true that everyone in the city knows that Bruce is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BatmanTheCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BatmanTheCharacter">Batman</a>, more people than usual seem to have guessed his secret, but have just chosen not to say anything. Justified, since the entire series except the finale is a Batman prequel show, and some of the plot revolves around different comic characters befriending Bruce over a decade before he ever puts on the mask, so they might know him better than they do in the comics. It becomes apparent by the end of the finale that Jim Gordon has guessed the new vigilante's identity, and that Harvey Bullock might be close to finding out. Remarkably, two villains also correctly guess Batman's identity, but neither seem inclined to say anything, most likely because they both actually like Bruce, and used to be his friends. Selina Kyle/Catwoman doesn't even need to see Bruce's face to realize who the mysterious vigilante stalking her is, and it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker">the Joker</a> all of a second to recognize Bruce under the mask when he encounters Batman for the first time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even though part of Bruce's face is covered, he hasn't seen him for ten years, and he's standing about fifty feet away from him.</a>

</li><li> Though it helps that, predating both examples, Vince McMahon made an announcement to that effect when officially announcing the Attitude Era.

It was very clear that he had <em>something</em> to do with the show, as much of <em>Impact Wrestling!</em> at the time had his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle">trademark booking</a> (at one point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBeautifulPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBeautifulPeople">The Beautiful People</a> said "SWERVE!" in reference to their heel turn during a promo), but it was rumor at best since the dirtsheets had no concrete proof, nor did TNA announce anything.

Construction had already begun in September 2001, and everyone already knew what the ride was going to be because of the September 21, 2001 edition of the <em>Orange County Register</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ybse');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2ybse" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ybse');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The ride was rethemed in 2017 to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyMissionBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyMissionBreakout">Guardians of the Galaxy &#150; Mission: BREAKOUT!</a></em></span>

In May of 1965, though, rumors began circulating that Disney was building an "East Coast" version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Disneyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Disneyland">Disneyland</a>. However, the <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> denied the rumors' accuracy based on an earlier interview with Walt Disney at the Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ttve');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3ttve" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ttve');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Disneyland received a makeover to Tomorrowland around this time</span> In October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the <em>Sentinel</em> visited Disneyland during the park's tenth anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida; Bavar later described that Disney "looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face" before denying the story... by going over why he <em>wouldn't</em> build a park there. His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida. Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the <em>Sentinel</em> published another article headlined, "We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney". Walt had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the <em>Sentinel</em> story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25, though kept the official reveal on November 15th.

In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> Akyuu most definitely considers Eirin and Kaguya humans as well as Reisen a <em>youkai</em> Earth Rabbit, even though almost a dozen people she could have told her they were Lunarians. The fact that Akyuu later devotes a whole section to a "Lunar Capital Exposition" Eientei hosted in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Kaguya_Houraisan">Kaguya's article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> laughs in the face of an earlier note where in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Eirin_Yagokoro">Eirin's article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> where Akyuu thinks she may have "a deep connection to the Lunar Capital."
<ul><li> From various world-building materials, it can be said that most human populace of Gensokyo are generally ignorant of many in-going of the world, mostly because Gensokyo's power-players (read: most named characters), whether it's youkai or humans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">are deliberately making it so to maintain Gensokyo's power balance between the races</a>. Best shown in <em>Forbidden Scrollery</em>; Kosuzu who doesn't know these conspiracies freaks out when she finds out the Noh dancer in Hakurei Shrine is a youkai who will control the populace's mind and reporting it to Marisa, the closest seemingly neutral human power-player she has contact with. Unfortunately, to those who know the true event of <em>Hopeless Masquerade</em>, it's no secret that Marisa is one of those who set up Kokoro as the shrine's Noh dancer as the most non-violent mean to channel her power, instead of almost triggering a civil war between the religious factions. What Kosuzu knows as "youkai extermination" is just a staged performance of those involved power-players so there's no misunderstanding over the "controlling the populace's mind" thing, not to stop it. In short, the "secret" is open to those people we, as the fourth wall audience, often fill the exposition shoes in as player characters and main antagonists but not so much for those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">nameless extras</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">who don't get into fights at the drop of a hat</a>.

The teams may <em>think</em> that they're being all sneaky and secretive in their dealings, but they often get spectators in the form of locals who live near their 'secret' bases, who just want to watch two teams of idiots blow each other up. It's also very heavily implied that the teams know the actual fights don't have much purpose, given that they're quite familiar with both the Administrator and Ms. Pauling, who keep the conflict going, but don't care because they like getting paid.

As Y'Shtola explains, they saw through it immediately, but Papalymo begged them to keep it a secret to humor her. As well, a part of her figured that they already figured it out, but just didn't want to believe it. It's unknown if the Eorzean leaders knew of this. It is however shown the Warrior of Light had no way of knowing this, regardless of if they started in 1.0 or A Realm Reborn, as the deception was already in play by the time they meet. To her credit, she apologizes for it.

The story behind that started when the twin Edefelt sisters went to Japan to participate in the Third Holy Grail War, only to lose. Because only one of them would be allowed to inherit the Edefelt's magic crest, the two were expected to fight to the death so that only the stronger of the two would return. The older sister returned, but with only half of her magic crest, claiming her sister's half had been destroyed in their battle. In reality, the younger sister was rescued by the Tohsaka heir, who later married her, and added her half of the magic crest to the Tohsaka's magic crest, granting her son and granddaughter the jewel magecraft that the Edefelts were well-known for. In the modern day, Rin and Luvia resemble reach other and use almost identical magecraft, yet maintain the history that Rin's grandmother was an unknown European woman, and that Luvia's grandmother survived the Third Grail War while her younger sister didn't.

Most major superheroes and supervillains &mdash; even those who didn't attend Whateley themselves &mdash; do know about it, as do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">The Syndicate</a> (who are a major backer), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Mutant Commission Office</a>, and most national and state/provincial governments. Many major metropolitan police departments have someone who is at least familiar enough with the school to know who to contact when a newly manifested mutant shows up, too. Lampshaded when a superteam in Cincinnati, which (unlike most others) has never had a mutant team member before, tries to find someone to help train an underage mutant who they'd come to be the guardians of. When someone finally asks, "Why not just send her to Whateley?", they are dumbfounded. They are then shocked to find that they are pretty much the only ones who had never heard of the school before.

<ul><li> In the early days of the series, big stars looking to guest-star would often go under aliases and their appearances weren't broadcasted much. The most famous are probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DustinHoffman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DustinHoffman">Sam Etic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">John Jay Smith</a>. The latter in particular had things relatively kept on the down-low and wasn't legally acknowledged as one of the most famous music stars in the country, even though pretty much everyone knew about them and the episodes they appeared in were laden with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusions</a>.

On the other hand, their membership seems to include just about every recurring male character in Springfield. It makes it even sillier that it took Homer so long to find out the organization existed, when, for instance, Lenny, Carl, Moe, and Barney were all members, and that's just in Moe's Tavern.
