</p><p>... Yes, of course, the technology has a bizarre effect that nobody could have predicted &#151; you really need to keep track of those inputs and outputs! Usually it's in the form of acquiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">sentience</a> or a bizarre weapon, or only being able to be used by people of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">target demographic</a>. (It's common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> series.)
</p><p>This is surprisingly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, particularly in programming, where the programmer is the only one who really understands how what they've built works (and sometimes, not even <em>them</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dy0i');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0dy0i" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dy0i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even a "simple" (no graphics, purely command-line and input file driven and with the only output being more text files) scientific application that does anything actually useful can easily exceed ten thousand lines of code in a high-level language and is probably the result of the work of multiple people, none of whom knows <em>every</em> detail of the parts they didn't write. And even if a single dedicated programmer wrote the whole thing personally, it's virtually certain that at least some of it uses infrastructure in the form of library routines or system calls that were not written by the same programmer.</span>). Especially in high-level languages, where the programmer can for example tell the computer to replace all occurrences of "cake" with "apple" in a text, and doesn't have to worry about how the system does it - they get a changed text back and that's that. This also happens in pharmacology, where it might be discovered that a drug has a positive effect on people with a certain illness but when it's first used doctors and scientists don't understand why.

<ul><li> For a while the Caster Gun employed by main character Gene Starwind was a black box of lost knowledge.

GN Drive technology can be mass produced in months (reversed engineered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> from the GN-X drive model), but <em>true</em> GN Drives, the ones which emit green "pure" particles used by Celestial Being's Gundams, are equipped with a "Topological Defect" Blanket, which can only be manufactured around Jupiter with a total production time of six years. Somehow harnessing the power of topological defects (a mathematical solution involving differential equations) allows the drive to funnel energy back into itself, allowing for unlimited operation time. Additionally, Celestial Being's true GN Drives have a literal black box which no-one could figure out, which turns out to contain <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the data for the Gundams' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Trans-Am Function</a> and the Twin-Drive System</span>.
</li><li> This is a main plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotechTheShadowChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotechTheShadowChronicles">Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles</a></em>. The Haydonites provide humans with shadow technology which greatly aids them in fighting Invid. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the technological information supplied by Haydonites is incomplete</span>, so even though the shadow devices were built by humans themselves, they still have flaws which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haydonites</span> exploit when they attack humans.
</li><li> In the American release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">Voltron</a></em> (which combined the separate series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoLion">GoLion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DairuggerXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DairuggerXV">Dairugger XV</a></em>), it's established that the Vehicle Voltron was built as an <em>imitation</em> of the original Lion Voltron built by the late King Alfor of Arus. Since the original Voltron is semi-mystical in nature and the magic was not copyable, the duplicate can only stay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">unified</a> in giant robot form for five minutes at a time.

He makes the comparison that just as we don't understand how magic works, most people don't understand how a computer turns on apart from pushing the "on" button.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KnightsOfSidonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KnightsOfSidonia">Knights of Sidonia</a></em> the Kabizashi blades, which are the only weapons that can kill Gauna. No one knows for sure how they work, and no one knows how to make more of them. They were recovered from inside a mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject">Big Dumb Object</a> floating in space, and their properties discovered by complete accident. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Production is later established.

</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO">Eureka Seven AO</a></em>, all IFOs are equipped with a "Third Engine" based on technology found in the Nirvash. They know it can use trapar as fuel, giving the IFO theoretically limitless flight time, and the Nirvash has increased speed and maneuverability while using it, but they have no idea how to turn it on or how it does these things. Elena and Fleur do eventually manage to get theirs working, but it only lasts as long as it needs to for them to rescue Ao, then shuts off almost immediately once he's free. Elena credits The Power of Love, which, given the previous series, is most likely the exact reason it worked. It activates a second time for Fleur in the finale, but nothing comes of that.

This doesn't stop many people, groups, and outside corporations from studying them. Stalkers have also figured out how to use some of the equipment in their daily lives, but they still have no idea how it works.
</li><li> In Dave Barnett's <em>Gideon Smith</em> novels, the British eventually control the mechanical brass dragon, Apep. Apep, despite being made in ancient Egypt during Akneheten's reign, is beyond the ability of a late 19th century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> Britain. The British would dearly love to copy Apep but can't because of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> used in its construction. British scientists have tested Apep and the mechanical doll bound to it, so they know that Apep can fly at 100 miles per hour (and possibly faster than that) and it has an unlimited supply of fireballs that are 1949 Celsius in temperature and these never lose any intensity of heat until they hit a target. However their studies show that the clockwork mechanisms making up Apep, should not have been able to work and they have no idea where Apep's fireballs come from. The only thing they know is that it takes a number of magical artifacts to use Apep.

Legend has it that they were created by the Grim Reaper himself and gifted to three brothers. Dumbledore speculates that it's more likely that said brothers were just prodigiously talented magical craftsmen. Whatever the case, no one has been able to replicate their three masterworks.
</li><li> Willis Linsay's stepper boxes in Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongEarth">The Long Earth</a></em>, which enable people to step from one world to another in an endless chain of parallel universes. They are cheap, easy to build using basic electronic components and powered by a potato. And nobody can figure out how they work. Just to make it more nonsensical they don't work for everyone, and a lot of people didn't used to need them but they all wandered off millions of years ago.

In effect, it is a virtual reality MMORPG located on their version of the Dark Net. It is an enormous city that doesn't seem to end, and nearly everything is trying to kill you. Most people use it like GTA, while teenagers use it to engage in orgies and drug use without harm, although a few are devoted to unlocking its mysteries. The one rule to play is that you only get one life, and are immediately and permanently locked out if you die. Its origins, and the reasons for its existence, are a complete mystery to everyone. Even the creator of the V-World technology has no idea who built it or why. The hardcore gamers all insist that there must be some reason or point to it, and are obsessed with the idea of "beating" the game, even though it doesn't seem to work that way. Eventually the point is rendered moot when the protagonist reshapes the whole world into a forest fantasy kingdom full of dragons. Really.

This leads to situations that look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">Forgotten Phlebotinum</a>, until two or three years down the line where the device pops up again.

The Goa'uld, on the other hand, make very little effort to study the Ancient technology they use. They've based their empire on things like the Stargates and ring transporters, but they really have no idea how any of it works. The titular Stargate ITSELF is a black box. It was built by the Ancients. They have figured out how to hook computers and power up to it and send signals to it. But the Stargate itself is way beyond human tech.

The New Avalon Institute of Science wanted to try taking the factory apart to see if they could replicate it or switch it over to produce a more powerful Battlemech, but fears that they wouldn't be able to put it back together afterword kept them from doing so. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot">timeline has progressed, however</a>, there have been some gains in the understanding of such technology.

</li><li> In a sort of meta-example, divine magic (the sort of magic used by Cleric spells) in Eberron works on a "clap your hands if you believe" basis. Unlike in other settings, even high-level Clerics cannot communicate directly with their gods; when they try to do so, at best they get an entity that claims to be a high-level servant of the god rather than the god itself. The setting is <em>extremely</em> coy with respect to whether or not any gods actually exist, and if so, <em>which ones</em>. Even the beings reached with, say, a <em>commune</em> spell will, if pressed, hang a lampshade on this, saying of <em>course</em> they haven't <em>personally</em> seen or talked to the gods, but they <em>must</em> exist, because praying to them works, doesn't it? Divine magic works even for the Clerics of one particular cult who <em>know for a fact</em> that their god does not exist (yet), because they're working on <em>building</em> it.

In theory, any Celestial Exalt (or Terrestrial of sufficient age and experience) could bring themselves to understand the complex workings of Solar artifice.

You seem to inherit traits from your parents, but having no idea of DNA, the mechanism for this is a mystery to Victorians who sometimes think it is somehow literally "in the blood" or "with the mother's milk," but that makes it hard to explain how plants can inherit traits.

One example would be the Gauntlets of Ultramar, a paired set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">power fists</a> with integrated boltguns that is a treasured relic of the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines. The Adeptus Mechanicus would love to study the Gauntlets, but since that would mean disassembling and possibly forgetting how to reassemble the weapons, the Ultramarines have "declined" the Mechanicus' requests to examine them, emphatically and repeatedly.
</li><li> The "gene-seed" that transforms a normal human into a Space Marine is derived from the genetic material of the twenty Primarchs, who were created by the Emperor of Mankind to lead his Great Crusade to reconquer the galaxy.

Instead, each Space Marine sports a pair of "progenoid" organs that can grow germ forms of all the other implants, which are cultivated by a chapter's Apothecaries to use in the next generation of recruits. This means one of an Apothecary's most important duties is securing the corpses of fallen battle-brothers and extracting those progenoid glands before they are lost to the enemy, and Space Marine chapters who run low on gene-seed, through battlefield losses or mutation, are in danger of dying out entirely.

A truly stand-out example has to be where one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> ended up creating a fortress so convoluted that one room ended up becoming its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">Pocket Dimension</a>.

<ul><li> Random events might result in your gaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor">Precursor</a> ship or two, which tend to be <em>far</em> stronger than anything you have for much of the game. You can't reverse-engineer the tech, but, by the end-game, you can build ships that are <em>better</em>.
</li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">manual</a>, the Arceans intended humans to fall into this trap when making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> via a sublight probe. They transmitted the plans for building a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">hyperspace gate</a>, deliberately modified by them to prevent humans from shutting the gate off, allowing the Arceans to invade Earth. Subverted, in that the humans said "hell no" and started trying to reverse-engineer the thing and figure out a way to make it better. They succeed by virtue of having developed fusion power and being able to minimize a "gate" into a portable hyperdrive. Then some idiot decides to send the plans to everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunner</a> technology is still considered this by the galaxy's current races, despite their best efforts to reverse-engineer it:
<ul><li> Not only is almost all of Covenant's technology reverse-engineered from Forerunner relics, but a good percentage of their equipment is directly constructed by prehistoric Forerunner machinery, and some high-end Covenant ships even have Forerunner components directly installed. However, due to the Covenant worshipping the Forerunners as gods, even just trying to better understand Forerunner technology runs the risk of being seen as heresy. For this reason, the Covenant do not use even their own knock-off technology very efficiently, much less the Forerunner originals.
</li><li> Proper Forerunner technology is still largely a mystery to humans, despite the occasional reverse-engineering success. For example, humanity's post-war flagship <em>Infinity</em> has several Forerunner components installed, including its slipspace drive. However, not even the ship's chief scientist quite understands how said components actually work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Spartan Ops</a></em>, one frustrated human scientist describes the current state of his species' research on Forerunner technology as such:
<div class="indent">"We're turning on dormant technology we don't know the first thing about! We're like <em>monkeys</em>, hammering on a nuclear bomb because we like the sound it makes!"
</div></li></ul></li><li> Deadliar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker">Hellsinker</a></em> previous nickname was Blackbox in true spirit of this this trope since noone had any idea how he operated and produced the results he did.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Historical and Technical Briefing</a> describes the discovery of a large amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> in the wreck of an ancient spacecraft, including something eventually identified as "a solid-state hyperspace induction module". It's implied that much of their limited understanding of how it actually works was gained from building a couple of scaled-down copies and fitting them to small spacecraft, pressing the 'on' button and watching to see what happened.
<ul><li> Then it turned out that said module is actually a 10,000-year old Progenitor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Far Jumper</a>; only three of them exist in the whole galaxy. One of these are in the posession of the Bentusi and it's the basis of all hyperdrives in the galaxy, save the Kushan ones. It is also said that no matter how much they study them, they can't figure out why the reverse-engineered versions are much slower than the originals even though they know how to make other ships tag along by "riding the quantum wavefront". In fact, combining the three Far Jumpers will <em>break the laws of physics</em> (black holes disable hyperdrives yet the Trinity still works flawlessly).
</li><li> The semi-canonical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> <em>Cataclysm</em> has a fourth hyperspace core, whose capabilities are on par with the Progenitor Far Jumpers (except it was built a <em>million years ago</em>), except that it came from another galaxy on an experimental exploration ship called the <em>Naggarok</em>. Besides the extremely-advanced hyperdrive, the ship also has inertialess sublight drives (allowing the massive craft to zip around the battlefield faster than any fighter), extremely-precise long-range ion cannons (able to swat fighters like gnats), and a powerful Phase Disassembler Array that can convert even a dreadnought into energy in a matter of seconds (said energy can then be used to build cruise missiles). While the ship is destroyed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> of the game, the tech inside it likely fits this trope.

<ul><li> The Citadel and mass relays are thought to be built by the Protheans. Humans and other races use them, though their inner workings and construction are poorly understood, and any attempt <em>to</em> understand them is regarded as an exercise in futility. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a>, the Reapers, were the real builders of these wonders, and the Protheans were just barely figuring out the technology themselves when they were wiped out.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Matriarch Aethyta</a> very much dislikes the black box nature of the relays and once proposed trying to study relays more intimately, maybe even building one.

</li><li> The design of their conventional FTL system is much the same, being almost entirely reverse-engineered from the Protheans. This means that they have no idea how to disengage certain safety protocols that prevent ships from being flown into planets or other vessels at relativistic velocities.

It's hammered home numerous times through the game that it could do damn near anything because while there are easily understandable blueprints for it, there's no data on how to use it or what it does. At one point Commander Shepard likens the situation to a child playing with his father's gun. It turns out to be little more than a giant power source used to brute-force hack the Citadel and Relay network to either destroy or control all Reapers.

The only wire soldered to the switch goes directly to the case of a server&mdash;specifically, to a ground pin. There is electrically no way it can affect anything on the server (except for EXTREMELY bizarre capacitance effects), and yet switching to "Magic" causes the server to crash.
</li><li> Genetic algorithms (computer programs that emulate neo-Darwinian synthesis) can produce hardware that no human could design. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genalg/genalg.html#examples:electrical">For example, an array of logic gates that sets its output high when it hears "go" and low when it hears "stop"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> This actually has a parallel in biology, with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA">non-coding DNA<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, sometimes called "junk DNA". Like computer code that doesn't produce any output, genome sequencing has revealed chunks of DNA in numerous species that have no apparent function, but mutations, errors, or omissions within these chunks still cause problems.
</li><li> Genetic algorithms have a variant called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">Evolutionary programming.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Basically, it's when you solve a programming task by having the computer generate an initial population of randomly-generated programs, then apply natural selection mechanism to mix-and-match them until you get a program which solves the task satisfactorily... but its code may be completely incomprehensible to a human. To make this an even stronger example, genetic algorithms just make random changes and go with what's best. They don't understand it either. It's a black box even to the designer.
</li></ul></li><li> Black Box programming is a very important concept in real life. For example, all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/API" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/API">APIs</a> (which allow developers to connect to things like Facebook or Google Maps) are black boxes; generally, the only details developers have are usage instructions and a description of what it does, since someone writing, say, a GPS application doesn't need to know anything about how Google Maps works.
<ul><li> In this case, this is actually considered a good thing: abstraction means compatibility. If your software is designed without using any knowledge of how the black box part works, it will (at least in theory) be possible to swap that library out for an updated or improved version later on. So long as <em>somebody</em> knows how it works, it's just a matter of trusting one's fellow engineers. In contrast, the moment you <em>have</em> to know how each variant of something really works instead of just one set of common operations, a task that should be trivial turns into a nightmare. Remember those DOS games and their sound setup programs?
</li><li> In object-oriented programming, objects are supposed to be black boxes, often having public and private groups of variables and functions. The "client" only need to know what the functions do and what should be put in the variables, and not anything about the inner workings. Similarly, template libraries and built-in functions in many programming languages (like C++'s STL) are Black Boxes. The documentation on C++'s sort() function, for example, doesn't tell you what kind of sorting algorithm is used, because it doesn't really matter (although one can deduce that it's probably a quicksort implementation from what they say about its running time).
<ul><li> And if someone else wants the class to do something else, the chances are they'll write another class that extends and/or calls the old one, rather than trying to rewrite the existing source code.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Large amounts of real world software source code is an absolute abomination of incomprehensible abbreviations, architectures which haven't evolved and grown so much as become cancerous, baffling hacks and plain old carelessness and stupidity or even just plain old lack of programming know-how. Such software will gain Black Box status pretty soon after the original developers move on.
<ul><li> Fun fact: Masi Oka (yes, Hiro from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a>) still has to do occasional effects work for his former employer, ILM, because nobody else knows how to use his software.
</li><li> This isn't unusual. Truly understanding non-trivial code written by someone else without documentation is considered the mark of a master programmer. It's said engineers don't retire, they just become consultants and come back to fix their old things when they break.
</li><li> Particularly this is true of cryptographic algorithms. You put plain text and encryption key in, and you get back line noise. Put line noise and decryption key in, and you get back plain text. Unfortunately so few people actually understand the algorithms and code that, even in open source software, bugs can lurk for a long time.
</li><li> More humorous example, in an attempt to cut government costs, California decided to fire a large chunk of government workers, then redo the pay rates for everyone left. Well, phase one went off fine, but come phase two they realized that every single person that knew enough about the payroll software to implement the changes was fired in phase one.
</li></ul></li><li> Older electronic (and most especially military) technologies may well have been designed by people who are dead, coded in languages which no-one ever hears of nowadays, use electronic standards long since obsoleted and built by companies that dissolved or got eaten by other companies some time ago. Black Boxhood arrives quite naturally for such devices, which could conceivably include missile guidance systems or nuclear warhead triggers which are still quite useable today.

</li></ul></li><li> COBOL used to be a very common language for developing business software in. Though superseded by modern languages like Java or Visual Basic, old working software was not replaced. The pool of skilled COBOL engineers is rapidly dwindling simply because they are retiring and in due course upgrade and maintenance engineers will simply not exist anymore.
<ul><li> Some colleges have tried to avert this by offering courses in COBOL.
</li></ul></li><li> It seems that the original programming of Microsoft Excel might be a black box, since after the principal programmer quit, the project virtually stopped. Luckily he came back.
</li><li> Many psychiatric drugs work via mechanisms that are either unknown or only loosely understood. The laborious (sometimes decades long) process of searching for side effects and other quirks irons out many of the Black Box problems that plague fiction.
<ul><li> On that subject, some (if not most) chemical reactions in general have mechanisms which are only vaguely understood at best.
</li></ul></li><li> Real Life is rife with stories of a programmer being fired for whatever reason, only for his ex-boss to realize nobody knows how to maintain the server.
</li><li> Due to the "digital rights" controversy, certain laws have been put into effect that <em>require</em> black boxes to remain black boxes, making it <em>illegal</em> even to try to crack into them. For example, it's now illegal to write programs to get past certain types of encoding on music, DVD's, and electronic books. If you have even a slight understanding of the way technology progresses, you'll probably see this move as either "stupid" or "scary", possibly both.
<ul><li> If you've followed the results, "laughable," "doomed," and "legally unenforceable" are more likely.
<ul><li> Especially when the concept of an "illegal number" is thrown around. The people responsible for Blu-Ray's encryption were trying to get people to stop distributing a 128-bit number on the internet because it was the encryption key. Of course, because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">Streisand Effect</a>, this number was posted <em>everywhere</em> on the internet within hours, with folks taking it as far as to design a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sample_09-F9_protest_art,_Free_Speech_Flag_by_John_Marcotte.svg">flag for free speech<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with colors derived from translating the encryption key into hex color values<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note178mq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note178mq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note178mq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaymansTerms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaymansTerms">Layman's Terms</a>, hex color values work with three byte values, each corrosponding to RGB values. #FF0000 would be red, #00FF00 would be green, #0000FF blue, #FFFFFF white (all three colors set to max), and #000000 for black (all three colors "off"), with a total of a little over 16 million possible colors if you don't count alpha channel (transparency). The first stripe of that flag uses #02F908, which are the first three numbers of the encryption key, and so on</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, anyone with a basic understanding of motivation and incentive will know very few people would even want to produce such technology in the first place without some protections because it it would just get stolen otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a>: During the early 18th century, Antonio Stradivari hand-crafted several wooden violins that, compared to other violins before or since, produce the highest-quality sound. Many violin manufacturers have, for centuries, attempted to not only replicate the sound of the Stradivarius, but have even labeled violins as "Stradivarius" as a marketing ploy. Unfortunately, when Stradivari died, the technology and skill required to produce a violin of such caliber died with him. Scientists continually do research on the Stradivarius sound and technologies to replicate that sound, and original Stradivarius violins remain to be the most valuable musical instruments in the world.
<ul><li> The "Stradivarius" label on violin is not there for marketing reasons. It's actually a model of violin - Antonio Stradivari's instruments had very specific proportions (also being slightly larger than ones made by competing crafters). If you see a violin labeled "Stradivari", it means that its proportions and size match those of an original Stradivari instrument.
</li><li> It has been speculated that the sound quality is due to the wood available at the time. He built them around the little ice age, and wood at that time was particularly thin and brittle due to the odd weather patterns, making them irreproduceable. On the other hand, other violin makers of the time were unable to reproduce it either.
</li><li> Blind listening tests between Strads and top-of-the-line modern instruments tend to be inconclusive, as the listeners tend to be top-rated violinists who can not only distinguish the sound of a Strad from a modern instrument, but can often tell you which particular Strad is being played. And sometimes who is playing it.
</li><li> While some new <a class="urllink" href="http://www.economist.com/node/21542380">evidence<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> proves that Stradivari violins aren't that great compared to modern violins, they could be still considered technical marvels back in the day and most of their influatued prices comes from being collection pieces.
</li></ul></li><li> Damascus steel. The precise technique through which blacksmiths of medieval Damascus produced their wares has been lost and no one since around 1750 has been able to duplicate the original exactly, although many have claimed to have done so.
</li><li> The philosophy of <em>instrumentalism</em> boils down to "the <em>only</em> important thing about any theory is whether it's usable, i.e. predicts a result of given experiment". Hunting for explanations is but a pointless infinite regression. This means that "light is truly made of particles" and "light is truly made of waves" are fancy statements that delusionally bind real events to imaginary constructs while "wave model correctly and in convenient form predicts diffraction/interference effects" or "particle model correctly and in convenient form predicts absorption/emission effects" states everything that really matters in this issue. From this point of view <em>anything</em> is a Black Box, the only difference is that we already know how to dismantle some blackboxes to several smaller blackboxes and what buttons to push.
</li><li> Arguably the universe itself is a black box since we don't (yet) have a complete physical theory of the universe. Also, while we do have two theories that work fine in their respective arenas (General Relativity: big and heavy stuff, Quantum Mechanics: small and light stuff), they are contradictory and become completely incomprehensible when used together.
<ul><li> There's also an older theory called classical Newtonian mechanics, which works for medium-size and medium-mass stuff. It was specifically created to avert this trope and describe a Universe governed by simple, understandable laws; it failed at that. However, it works nicely for 90% of the stuff we encounter in our lives, and that's why it, and not GR or quantum is taught at schools.
</li></ul></li><li> The plans for the Saturn V rocket from the Apollo Project are stored in a format that isn't readable by any computer currently in use. Since there are a few leftover rockets, that could potentially be fueled up and fired, they have become black boxes. When the new designs for the Orion spacecraft (not the nuclear-bomb one, the newer one) were in the works, the ability to look at the old Saturn design and learn from them was denied the engineers, who had to waste potentially years starting from scratch. Since then, to avoid this trope, a project was initiated to attempt to retrieve the data and transfer it onto a more modern storage medium, but it's so underfunded that it's not currently active.
<ul><li> Although some of that is true, there are other significant factors involved - for instance, not being allowed to use asbestos anymore even though we know how. It's not <em>purely</em> a case of "no longer able to read the plans."
</li><li> This is an urban myth. The Saturn V plans are stored on microfilm. While readers are not nearly as commonplace as they were at the time of the rocket's conception, they're still readily available.
</li><li> Though microfilms do exist, several key parts were destroyed due to Cold War policies on classified materials. The Orion engineers also had access to the engines from one of the original (IXX, I think) F1 engines taken from the rocket currently displayed at the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
</li><li> Adding more to this one - the plans for the Saturn V still exist. However, what has been lost are the many changes that were made at the manufacturing level. That documentation has been, for the most part, lost, so we don't know (for example) how the actual F1 engines differs from the plans. This is the real issue in trying to recreate any old piece of technology. It's not just enough to have the dimensions and assembly drawings that show <em>what</em> you're trying to build, but things like materials specifications and manufacturing practices that tell you <em>how</em> to build it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, thanks to a heady mixture of personal eccentricities, outlandish claims, and industrial FUD both during and after his time, has a reputation for this sort of thing rivaled only by fiction. All his <em>well-documented</em> inventions work from explicable, if clever, principles of engineering &mdash; but poorly documented claims abound of death rays, earthquake generators, and yet stranger things unreproducible by modern science.
<ul><li> The fact his documented ideas tended to get stolen (usually by Edison) might have something to do with it.
</li></ul></li><li> SR-71 Blackbird recon plane: Due to ongoing modifications to their respective airframes each Blackbird had its own set of blueprints. Thus, each Blackbird was unique, although they looked identical. The original molds or dies used in the manufacturing of the planes were ordered destroyed by then Secretary of Defense McNamara (Cold War policies again) so it would be nearly imposible to make new Blackbirds or even spare parts (In fact other airframes had to be cannibalized to keep the fleet airworthy), although a lot of planes survive to this day so reverse engineering could be feasible.
</li><li> The human body itself is quite the black box. With the exception of your occasional doctor or biologist, everyone uses theirs without the slightest hint of how the lot of it works. The brain in particular is quite the mystery, for if it was simple enough we could easily understand it, we would be unable to do exactly that.
</li><li> While there is still debate on the subject, nobody knows <em>for sure</em> why a bicycle stays upright when you ride it. It just does. Numerous theories have been put forth with some of them holding water. See this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19442_8-simple-questions-you-wont-believe-science-cant-answer.html">Cracked article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> The same article also lists several other questions that even modern science can't answer: why we sleep, how many planets are in the Solar System, why ice is slippery, how to beat Solitaire, how many animal species exist, what is the length of the US (or any) coastline, how does gravity work. A lot of these questions that we just either never ask or accept a universally-known explanation, which is actually false.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a fad for "miracle cure" machines at the beginning of the twentieth century that were actually called Black Box machines. You just set a few controls, turned it on, and whatever quack therapy that model was based on would cure the illness. The reason they were intentionally kept as black boxes was the controls did nothing to its function, and most in fact had no working parts, or the method of using the device was subject to considerable interpretation not based in any standard practice. One good example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">E-meter</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Any self-taught coder will make these whenever they program... well anything. How bad it is depends on the degree of "self-taughtedness".
</li><li> This situation tends to happen whenever a nation receives exported military equipment from another nation's military (planes, tanks, ships etc.) and something sours political relations between them. A sudden change in government, or an embargo due to some unsavory incident can effectively turn a chunk of a nation's military into a black box. No longer getting the support in terms of maintenance to keep them in service or upgrades to keep them relevant, the material in question rapidly becomes warehoused for fear of damaging it beyond repair or obsolete. Solutions are varied, ranging from reverse-engineering, putting in locally-made upgrades, producing their own replacements or getting a replacement from another friendly nation. Examples include the F-14's Iran received before the Shah was overthrown and various helicopter models China received just before the Tienanmen Square incident.
<ul><li> The Japanese have bought a license for an advanced Russian jet. They assemble it exactly by the blueprints, and it turns out to be a steam locomotive. They check the blueprints, gather their best engineers and assemble it again. Still locomotive. They file a complaint to the Russians, so the Russian team arrives, goes into the workshop and shortly produces a perfectly good jet. The Japanese are astonished: "We've tried it again and again and only got a steam train!" "Why, of course", reply the Russians, "did you Read the Fine Print? First you get a steam train. And then you work on it with a rasp."
</li></ul></li><li> For a very common (and far more mundane) example, many, if not most, things that people use day-to-day are effectively black boxes. There is an oft-quoted analogy about how the ability to <em>drive</em> a car does not equate an ability to design and <em>build</em> a car, or even to fix one. For a fun thinking exercise, see if you can actually explain the workings of a microwave oven, or a computer, or a cell phone, or any other number of things you use daily.
<ul><li> Once you give up, go <a class="urllink" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In biology, the occasional black box arises in the form of a living organism. For example, of the twenty or so species of beaked whale known to science, about three are well documented. The rest are very poorly understood, some of which we haven't even seen living specimens of yet. Where they live, how they breed, what they eat, how deep they dive, none of these are known. We know that they exist because we have dead bodies (for a while, one species was known only by <em>a jawbone</em>), but <em>how</em> they exist is largely a mystery.
</li><li> For much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, nuclear weapons were black boxes, either entirely or to the people working with them. All nukes were designed by multiple people, but sometimes these teams worked loosely with each other in isolation, the effect being that no one person knew how a particular nuclear weapon worked. This method of security eventually fell out of favor as some of the bombs produced by these teams were abject failures; to the extent that at one point in US history, nearly all the warheads carried by US submarines were duds due to their faulty safety systems. In the other case of nuclear black boxes, teams designing ICBMs and bomb cases were given the bare minimum of information needed to design a delivery system.
<ul><li> A remarkable example of this effect is describing how, exactly, thermonuclear bombs work: Only the engineers and scientists who have designed them actually <em>know.</em> Even though the technology is over a half-a-century old and possessed by at least half-a-dozen countries, details of the mechanism have remained strictly classified. The public "Teller-Ulam" design which may (or may <em>not</em>) be the de facto standard for all fusion weapons has been pieced together mainly through inference and assumption, and is quite free of details.
</li></ul></li><li> Several of the computer rankings that make up the Bowl Championship Series formula in college football are proprietary. Accordingly, no one exactly knows why they would rank the teams in the way they do, and major bowl bids (and millions of dollars) can hinge on the result. The BCS system was replaced in 2014 by a selection committee that decides how teams are ranked, with the top four teams playing for a national championship at the end of the season.
</li><li> The Mechanical Turk was a machine built in the eighteenth century that supposedly was able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent. Though the cabinet could be opened to reveal a complex gear mechanism, nobody who saw it in action could figure out how it worked. Of course, the reason was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Turk wasn't an automaton at all, but was concealing a human player</span>, and the reason no one could determine exactly what was going on for almost a century was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the human player</span> was very well-hidden. That said, several people over that span came close to figuring it out, but their hypotheses were always flawed in some way.
</li><li> Hex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> (above) was based on one of Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s own computers, a ZX Spectrum he tinkered with and added hardware to until it did what he wanted. Eventually he lost track of it all, and there were components which he couldn't remember or deduce the purpose of, but it you took them out everything stopped working.
</li><li> Black boxes, often by that name, are used as an important learning tool in signal processing. The idea is that you give a student a way to produce a variety of inputs (oscillators, noise generators), a suite of measuring tools (oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers), and a black box. By applying different inputs, taking measurements, and applying the signal processing principles they've been taught, they try to infer exactly what's inside the black box. With enough constraints on the parameters (e.g., "This will only contain amplifiers and attenuators, because we haven't learned about filters yet.") the black box can become simply a logic puzzle.
</li><li> In topology diagrams used by computer network admins, a part of the network whose internal structure is unknown or irrelevant is represented by a cloud. A site to site WAN linking two corporate sites, such as an internet VPN tunnel or private WAN are good examples. The admin doesn't have to worry about what technologies are used internally within the cloud; they just care that it gets packets from one side to the other. This is where the term "cloud computing" comes from.
</li><li> At the University of Oxford there is a battery powering a bell that was made in 1840 and is still running today and nobody knows how this is possible because the records of how the battery was made were lost. They are waiting for it to run out of power before they take it apart to see how it works.
</li><li> A significant part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges">The Dark Ages</a> after the fall of the Roman Empire turned a lot of the Empire's technological developments into this. Highly effective concrete, the ability to build aqueducts, their methods of producing weapons and armor, and more were all lost when the Empire collapsed, and it took hundreds of years for society to recover to the point where they could reach and surpass it. In the East this is <em>still</em> happening with the Byzantine recipe for Greek Fire. When the Empire fell the recipe was lost, and to this day no one knows what was in it in order to make it be able to burn so intensely, even on water.
</li><li> A variant of this trope: in ancient times doctors would recommend people suffering from depression and the like drink mineral water from springs. While it worked, they had no idea why. It turns out to be because water from springs tends to contain a lot of lithium, which has an anti-depressant effect and is still used for that purpose.
</li><li> In archive science, the "black box" method (devised at the University of Michigan in the 1980s) refers to a schema for making appraisal decisions. The goal was to create a series of questions archivists could ask to evaluate documents, granting a level of transparency to decisions that may not otherwise be clearly motivated &mdash; in other words, to <em>avoid</em> the black box.
