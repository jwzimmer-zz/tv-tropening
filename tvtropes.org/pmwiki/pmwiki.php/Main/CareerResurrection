Between then and 2015, she mostly worked on video game voiceovers (and mostly humanitarian work) and not so many anime roles. Since her casting as Chibi-Usa, starting in the second season of <em>Sailor Moon</em>, she has become more active again, even landing another anime role in 2015 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em> playing Eddelrittuo.

In 2000, she left voice acting behind to concentrate on a music career, and when she came back in 2009, she was limited to minor roles due to being out of the industry for a long time. Eventually, she would receive the role of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateEXTRA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateEXTRA">Fate/EXTRA</a>'s</em> Saber (Nero), bringing her to prominence once again thanks to the <em>Fate</em> franchise's growth in popularity with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> as well as the expansion of <em>EXTRA's</em> contents, in addition to a role in another growing franchise (Cagliostro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>).

But when Pokemon Company International licensed the show, she and the rest of the cast were replaced, and the fall of the voice acting industry in New York, especially for anime, left her without work. But she moved to LA a few years ago and has started to come back to voice acting, with her first major LA-based anime role being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Pluto</a>.

As one of the UK's biggest TV stars in the early 2000s, Morrissey decided to go to Hollywood, and picked out what seemed like the perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole">Star-Making Role</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BasicInstinct2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BasicInstinct2">Basic Instinct 2</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole">We all know how that turned out</a>.

His career crashed down in 1989 when he was caught filming a sex tape with a 16-year-old. The act was considered legal in Georgia at the time, so his charges were dismissed, but it was <em>not</em> kosher in the minds of the public, and the backlash drove Lowe to check into rehab and become sober.

In the 2000s, Lyonne's career bottomed out after she was arrested for various bizarre incidents, and by 2005, she was in the hospital for hepatitis C, a heart infection, and a collapsed lung. She even went through a methadone treatment for a heroin addiction and had track marks on her body. In 2008, Lyonne later sobered up and resumed her acting career, working her way back to the mainstream, landing major acclaim in 2013 with the hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> series <em>Orange is the New Black</em>, and reuniting with her former <em>American Pie</em> co-star Jason Biggs (who hasn't been nearly as successful as she was in escaping <em>Pie</em>'s shadow). She subsequently appeared in another Netflix show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RussianDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RussianDoll">Russian Doll</a></em>, that put her unmistakably in the starring role.

Danson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomHanksSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomHanksSyndrome">surprisingly strong performance</a> garnered rave reviews from critics and his first Emmy nomination in 15 years. The renewed exposure also landed him a role in the HBO comedy series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoredToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoredToDeath">Bored to Death</a></em> a part as the new lead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> after Laurence Fishburne's departure, and a leading role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">The Good Place</a></em>.

In fact, Chiklis has pulled this off <em>twice</em>. First came his starring role in the much-despised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBelushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBelushi">John Belushi</a> biopic <em>Wired</em>, which saw his career dry up for two years and is considered by Chiklis to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>. Then, after starring on the successful series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCommish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCommish">The Commish</a></em>, he almost killed his career with the critically bashed sitcom <em>Daddio</em>, but <em>The Shield</em> brought him back from the brink and into the limelight, as well as earning him an Emmy award.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a></strong> seems to have had a minor one of these thanks to his role as Pierce Hawthorne in the cult sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>; while the show hasn't been his biggest hit ever, it's nevertheless a critical darling with an intensely devoted fanbase, and since his career was previously languishing with a series of critical and commercial cinematic flops and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct to Video</a> releases, it's a definite step up. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">well-received</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">cameo role</a> in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine">Hot Tub Time Machine</a></em> probably helped as well.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman">Larry Hagman</a></strong> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em>. Hagman almost had his career destroyed by <em>The Good Life</em> and <em>Here We Go Again</em>, two unsuccessful sitcoms he made after NBC pulled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a></em>. Then came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimetimeSoap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimetimeSoap">Primetime Soap</a> that revived his career. Then the short-lived <em>Orleans</em> sank his career a second time. But just before he died, <em>Dallas</em> brought him back &mdash; yet again.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCaviezel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCaviezel">Jim Caviezel</a></strong> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>. He got caught up in the hype and controversy surrounding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfTheChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfTheChrist">The Passion of the Christ</a></em>, making it difficult for audiences to see him as anything but Jesus and his career suffered for a while (something Mel Gibson warned Caviezel would happen), but his performance as John Reese is widely regarded as this.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry">Jack Barry</a></strong>: The co-creator and host of the 1950s quiz show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyOne">21</a></em>. While the show proved popular, it was soon discovered to be rigged &#151; contestants were being <em>cast</em> and literally fed information on which questions they were to get right and wrong. The rigging allegations hit their high point in 1958 when contestant Herbert Stempel was ordered by the producers to lose against Charles van Doren. Stempel blew the whistle on the rigging, and while his claims were initially dismissed as sour grapes, the show <em>did</em> fall under investigation after another producer's game show, <em>Dotto</em>, was proven to be rigged as well (and subsequently canceled). After the investigations, <em>Twenty One</em> was canceled, and the concept of a quiz-based game show was tarnished for many years to come. (The 1964 debut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>, whose very idea was spawned from a discussion that creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin">Merv Griffin</a> had with his wife over said riggings, played a big factor in making quizzers viable again.) After a few minor hosting gigs in the '60s, Barry and co-producer Dan Enright managed to come back into vogue in 1971 with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild">The Joker's Wild</a></em>, with Barry as host. The show ran for a combined 15 years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivedItsCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivedItsCreator">outliving Barry himself</a> by two. The success of <em>Joker</em> also allowed Barry and Enright to revive one of their other, less-tarnished 1950s properties, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></em>, from 1978&#150;86.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonBateman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonBateman">Jason Bateman</a></strong> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>. Bateman obtained teen-idol status in the 1980s due to his work on sitcoms such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SilverSpoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SilverSpoons">Silver Spoons</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoganFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoganFamily">The Hogan Family</a></em>. Then he did the flop sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenWolfToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenWolfToo">Teen Wolf Too</a></em>, which marked the beginning of his career decline. After <em>The Hogan Family</em> left the airwaves in 1991, Bateman was out of the limelight, stuck in telefilms, B-movies, and a number of short-lived sitcoms. Then he was cast as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">The show drew poor ratings but garnered critical acclaim, and Bateman's performance garnered him many accolades</a>.

For animated films, Bateman voiced the male lead in the hit animated movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper">Billie Piper</a></strong> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> is somewhat of an example.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristianSlater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristianSlater">Christian Slater</a></strong> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot">Mr. Robot</a></em>. Slater was a hot commodity in the late '80s and early '90s after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers">Heathers</a></em> came out. By the end of the decade, his popularity was waning with bombs like <em>Hard Cash</em> and <em>Mindhunters</em>. Slater's career was sealed shut after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005">Alone in the Dark</a></em> tanked, a film that also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameMoviesSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameMoviesSuck">solidified the bad reputation of video game movies</a> and turned director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a> into a worldwide laughingstock. Slater then went straight to video and none of his series (including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyOwnWorstEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyOwnWorstEnemy">My Own Worst Enemy</a></em>) ever made it past a single season. In 2015, he starred as the title character in <em>Mr. Robot</em>. The series received widespread acclaim, and Slater won a Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award for his performance and has a recurring role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">a fictional version of himself</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSpelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSpelling">Aaron Spelling</a></strong> was a very prolific producer who provided a good chunk of programming for the ABC network. This all came to an end in the late 1980s when the new management at ABC publicly told the press that the network would no longer be "Aaron's Broadcasting Company", effectively shutting Spelling out of the network. This downfall was short-lived, however, when a year later, the then-new FOX network started picking his shows up, starting with the hit series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a></em>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlyssaMilano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlyssaMilano">Alyssa Milano</a></strong> was a child star in the '80s for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss">Who's the Boss?</a></em> and a music career in Japan. She was desperate to escape the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a> that dogs many child actresses and sought out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> roles as an adult. Things didn't work out so well, and the only notable story about her in the '90s was a sex tape scandal. But things started to turn in her favour when she joined the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelrosePlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelrosePlace">Melrose Place</a></em> and was later one of the leads for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>. The supernatural drama about three witch sisters lasted for eight seasons and got Alyssa worldwide fame. By the time it ended, Milano was better known as Phoebe Halliwell than she ever was as Samantha Micelli. After the show ended, she marketed a successful clothing line and settled in comfortably as the hostess of <em>Project Runway: All Stars</em>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder">Gene Wilder</a></strong> suffered through a severe career slide in the late '80s, coinciding with the 1989 cancer death of his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GildaRadner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GildaRadner">Gilda Radner</a>, that continued through the '90s until he took on the role of a theater director turned gumshoe in a couple of A&amp;E television movies that met with critical and audience acclaim. He followed them up with a couple of guest spots on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>, which earned him an Emmy win, his first acting award since 1962. He then turned his attention to writing before advancing Alzheimer's disease caused him to cease working again before his death in 2016.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore">Mandy Moore</a></strong> saw both her film and music careers take a downturn after 2007, the former after the flop of <em>License to Wed</em> and the latter after her transition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkMusic">folk pop</a>, despite winning some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeReallyCanAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeReallyCanAct">plaudits from surprised critics</a> (who mainly remembered her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a>), failed to pick up much commercial traction. She spent several years doing recurring roles on TV shows, her only theatrically-released film being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em> in 2010.

</li><li> <strong>Josh Hamilton</strong> was one of the most highly touted prospects in the history of baseball when he was drafted first overall by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. But after sustaining injuries in a 2001 car accident, he turned to alcohol and drugs to ease the pain, leading to him become hopelessly addicted to them. As a result of his substance abuse and further injuries, he was banned and <em>out of baseball in 2004, 2005 and most of 2006</em>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a> then named him the 35th worst draft pick of all time. Then, amazingly, he found religion, cleaned himself up, went to Cincinnati and then Texas, and has now gone on to be one of the game's best players, including an amazing home run derby performance in 2008. Unfortunately, Hamilton then had a couple of relapses in 2012 and 2015 and hasn't played since.
</li><li> <strong>Tony Mandarich</strong> was hyped as the greatest offensive line prospect of all time going into the 1989 NFL draft. This was enough for the Green Bay Packers to draft him second that year. Unfortunately, Mandarich was widely believed to have been using steroids (when in fact he only used alcohol and painkillers in the league; Mandarich only did steroids in college), which hindered his on-field performance. He was so bad as a starter that the Packers cut ties with him after the 1991 season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/SportsIllustrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/SportsIllustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> called him "The NFL's Incredible Bust", and he could only watch as the other four players taken in the Top 5 of his draft class (Troy Aikman, Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, and Deion Sanders) carved out Hall of Fame careers. His drug and alcohol addiction soon spiralled out of control, and he went to rehab in 1995. As the sports blog Deadspin put it best, "in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce">Vanilla Ice</a>-like return from the dead", the Indianapolis Colts gave a newly sober Mandarich a second chance for the 1996 season, where he spent the next three years as a serviceable starter (even protecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a> in his rookie season).
</li><li> <strong>Kurt Warner</strong> was a top-five quarterback in the early 2000s for the St. Louis Rams, heading up the "Greatest Show on Turf". Around the middle of the decade, a few bad games - along with the performance of Marc Bulger - led to his going to the New York Giants, where he played for a few games and was quickly supplanted by Eli Manning. After that, he went to Arizona, where up-and-down play meant he was sharing the starting job with Matt Leinart until 2008, when he shook off the cobwebs, returned to greatness, and led the Arizona Cardinals all the way to the Super Bowl (their first ever). He retired after another playoff season with his legacy cemented and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2017.
</li><li> <strong>Carson Palmer</strong> won the Heisman Trophy award in 2002, which was enough for the Cincinnati Bengals to take him first in the 2003 NFL draft. After sitting out his rookie season, he made two Pro Bowls in 2005 and 2006. Around 2010-2012, Palmer was stricken with the "Heisman curse", and his production spiraled downhill, especially with the Oakland Raiders. After signing with the Arizona Cardinals, Palmer started rebuilding his momentum until 2015, when he made his first Pro Bowl in 9 years, at the late age of 36, scoring the best QB rating, and most touchdowns and yards, in his career.
</li><li> <strong>Michael Vick</strong> was the first overall pick in 2001 NFL Draft for the Atlanta Falcons. He was never known as a top 10 quarterback - mediocre accuracy contributed to that - but he was solid enough for Atlanta. However, a brash personality was just the start of his problems. Vick was infamously busted for dogfighting in 2007 and spent 21 months in prison, with all of his fans (and sponsors) deserting him. After his release, he signed on with the Philadelphia Eagles, largely sitting on the bench for his first year there. After Donovan McNabb got traded, he got the starting job and never looked back, having the best statistical year of his career. In 2011, he was signed to a $40 million contract, resigned with Nike and carried a humble demeanor - if that's not a resurrection, nothing is.
</li><li> <strong>Marv Albert</strong> is arguably, the greatest NBA announcer ever (perhaps the closest rival to that throne is the late, great Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick Hearn). Not only was he the longtime voice of not only the New York Knicks but also the New York Rangers hockey team and a top announcer for NBC Sports during the 1980s and 1990s. However, it all crashed down in 1997 when Albert was caught up in a sex scandal involving him allegedly sodomizing a woman (and biting her back) in a motel. After finishing calling the 1997 NBA Finals for NBC, Albert was fired by the network. Albert slowly but surely worked his way back, first with Turner Sports on their NBA broadcasts (as well as the Wimbledon tennis tournament) and with NBC. Finally, in 2000-01, Albert returned to the top spot as NBC's lead NBA announcer, replacing Bob Costas, who had the job the previous three seasons. He held that post until NBC lost the NBA TV rights to ABC/ESPN after the 2001-02 season. Shortly thereafter, Albert became lead play-by-play man for TNT's NBA broadcasts and CBS Radio's <em>Monday Night Football</em> broadcasts.
</li><li> <strong>Landon Donovan</strong> became a worldwide name with a sterling performance for the USA at the 2002 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a>, earning a Young Player of the Year award and attracting European interest. Then came the failed stints at German clubs, the whining about homesickness that earned him the nickname Landycakes, his lackluster play in the '06 Cup, and the eventual humiliation of losing his captain's armband at LA Galaxy to then-frenemy David Beckham. That turned around in 08/09: he became the country's all-time highest goalscorer, Galaxy's new manager restored him as team captain, and (with a newfound maturity he credited to his divorce) he played a vital part in taking the USA to the finals of the Confederations Cup. A highly successful loan to English team Everton and a career-high performance at the 2010 World Cup followed. Even the most cynical American soccer fans will now admit he's one of the country's all-time best players. He eventually retired in 2014 as the second-most capped player, the best goal scorer of the national team, and so much of an MLS legend that since 2015, the league's MVP receives the Landon Donovan MVP Award. Donovan came back to Los Angeles for one last hurrah in 2016 as a free agent after the team's stars went down with season-ending injuries. He couldn't stay retired, coming back <em>again</em> in 2018 with Mexican top-flight side Le&oacute;n. Donovan lasted only five months in Liga MX, but then returned to the US, joining the San Diego Sockers of the Major Arena Soccer League in 2019. Donovan ended his playing career again after the 2019 MASL season, but remains in the game as principal owner and head coach of San Diego Loyal SC, which began play in the second-tier USL Championship in 2020.
</li><li> Brazilian footballer <strong>Ronaldo</strong> did it twice. At the age of 17, he was a successful striker enough to be called for the victorious 1994 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup">FIFA World Cup</a> squad (though he didn't play any games). Then in 1998, he suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">convulsion</a> before the World Cup final that caused him and the rest of Brazil's team to play bad enough to lose 3-0. Knee problems kept him out of the field for the most part of 1999-2001. Still, national team coach Felip&atilde;o believed in Ronaldo enough to bring him to the 2002 World Cup, where he was both champion and top scorer (including the 2 goals in the final). Between 2005 and 2008, his career again stalled, with injuries, weight gain and a conturbed personal life (such as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">infamous case involving transvestites</a>). Then he returned to Brazil, where he became an idol in Corinthians.
</li><li> <strong>Rick Ankiel</strong> (formerly of the St. Louis Cardinals) was a promising pitcher early in his career. However, after a while, he fell into a huge slump and was sent down to the minors. After a few years of bouncing back and forth between the majors and the minors and showing no signs of returning to his former promise, he was allowed a second chance as an outfielder. After training, he came back up to the majors and became a solid addition to the St. Louis outfield, making several outstanding plays- ironically aided by his pitcher's arm allowing him to make some incredibly accurate plays from quite long distances. Ankiel was later traded and is still considered a good outfielder, if not really a star.
</li><li> <strong>R.A. Dickey</strong>, a pitcher for the Rangers in the early- to mid-noughties and had pitching skills and stats that, at their zenith, were mediocre. Then he decided to try the knuckleball, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">joke pitch</a> of baseball, and wound up bouncing around the minors, with occasional stints in the majors for several years. In 2010, he signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets who called him up in mid-May and was one of the few things that season for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Mets</a> fans to cheer about: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">joke pitch</a> had become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">lethal joke pitch</a>. Two years later, he won the Cy Young Award, and in 2013, the Toronto Blue Jays made him their ace.
</li><li> <strong>Steve Stricker</strong> was one of the many solid but not spectacular golfers that became prominent in the mid-1990s, right around Tiger Woods' rise to stardom. Stricker would have three wins by the end of 2001, but by then his career hit a heavy slump with no apparent way out. Fortunes changed in the 2006 US Open when he led at the halfway mark and treaded his way through one of the most difficult Opens in history en route to a tie for sixth. This would begin a steady rise back to a form as good as, if not better, than the one he had in the 90s, first culminating in a win at the 2007 Barclays tournament, the PGA Tour's first playoffs event under the inception of the FedEx Cup. Since then, he picked up eight more wins and remained a constant contender for the Cup until he dialed back his schedule from 2013 on to focus more on his family. When he turned 50 in February 2017, he began easing onto PGA Tour Champions (i.e. the senior tour), and while still spending about half of his time on the regular tour, won two senior major championships in 2019. He'll also be the (non-playing) captain for Team USA at the 2021 Ryder Cup (delayed from 2020 due to COVID-19) in his home state of Wisconsin.
</li><li> <strong>Teemu Sel&auml;nne</strong> caught the NHL by storm when he scored 76 goals for the Winnipeg Jets in his rookie season in 1992-93. Dubbed "The Finnish Flash", Sel&auml;nne would electrify crowds for years- first in Winnipeg and then in Anaheim and San Jose- before his flashy play caught up to him requiring multiple knee surgeries. After performing poorly as a member of the Colorado Avalanche in 2003-04- where he was at times not even used during games- it was thought that his career was finished, his knee injuries catching up to him as they did with Pavel Bure, a similarly flashy player who crashed out of the league at roughly the same time. However, in 2005-06- using the lockout cancelled 2004-05 season to recover- Sel&auml;nne signed again with the Ducks, where he again regained his status as a star scorer (and became a more complete player), a role he continued to have for several more seasons. He retired under his terms at the end of the 2013&#150;14 season, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teemu-selanne-paul-kariya-headline-2017-hockey-hall-fame-class/">he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame 3 years later<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <strong>Bryan Berard</strong> was the first overall draft pick in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, becoming a highly regarded young defenceman for the New York Islanders. His career would blossom after being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, but on March 11, 2000, he was struck in the eye by Ottawa's Marian Hossa after Hossa's stick caught Berard in the follow-through for a shot on goal. Berard was blinded in the eye, and it was thought his career was finished. After a year of numerous surgeries, though, Berard would eventually restore his vision to NHL standards, allowing him to revive his NHL career. Though he never became the superstar he was predicted to become, Berard still wound up having a solid career with Chicago, both teams in New York, the Columbus Blue Jackets and Vityaz Chekov in Russia before retiring in 2009.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeBronJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeBronJames">LeBron James</a></strong> At separate points in his career, LeBron has seen a massive turn around in both success and popularity. James had a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHypeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHypeMachine">hype machine</a>, being dubbed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> before even being drafted into the NBA. In 2003, at the young age of 18, he joined his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers, turning the team from low tier team in a city notoriously cursed with bad luck regarding sports into a guaranteed presence in the playoffs. Despite James' gifts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">they could never make it out of the playoffs.</a> Their single Finals appearance in 2007 saw them getting swept in four games, and the reemergence of the Boston Celtics from 2008-2010 made returning to the Finals an impossible task. This caused many to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">call into question whether James was actually worth the hype.</a> He controversially decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">take his talents to South Beach</a> in Miami in 2010 to create a "superteam" with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh; the results were 4 consecutive Finals Appearances and LeBron winning the championship, league MVP, and Finals MVP back-to-back in 2012-13, solidifying his place as the best single player of the early 2010s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">at the cost of the acclaim and love from the public that he had generally enjoyed during the early days of his career</a>. Then before the 2014-2015 season, he stunned the world and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeBackTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeBackTraitor">went back home to Cleveland</a> with the sole purpose of winning a championship for the beleaguered city. He did just that in the 2016 Finals, almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">single-handedly powering his team back from a 3-1 game deficit</a> against the dominant Golden State Warriors and winning his 3rd Finals MVP. As a result of the win, he ended Cleveland's 52-year championship drought and won, cemented his status as one of the greatest players of all time, and won back most of the respect and admiration that he had lost when he left for Miami 6 years prior. Also in 2016, baseball's Cleveland Indians made their first World Series since 1997, while the city's minor league hockey team, the Lake Erie (now Cleveland) Monsters, won the AHL title. All in all, it was a great year for Cleveland, Ohio. He led the Cavs to the Finals the next two seasons, losing out to the Warriors each time, and then left for the Los Angeles Lakers... though this time, he left on <em>much</em> better terms, given that (1) he handled his second departure in a far more mature and classy manner than in 2010 and (2) it was clear to even the Cavs' most avid fans that their title window had closed.
</li><li> <strong>Alex Smith</strong> became the first overall draft pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2005, but was written off as a draft bust for a while due to mediocre play. Then in 2011, which was initially expected to be his last year on the team, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, getting just one away from his career high touchdowns and reducing his interceptions from 10 to 5, setting personal bests in rushing and taking the team to the playoffs. He was set to have a repeat performance the following year until an injury gave the job to Colin Kaepernick but rebounded the next year after signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, setting career bests in yards and touchdowns. As of 2017, Smith and the Chiefs are a perennial playoff team while Kaepernick, due to a combination of poor play and political controversy, found himself out of the NFL and the 49ers as a whole have fallen. In January 2018, Smith was traded to The Team Formerly Known as the Redskins, a team with bad luck at the QB position.
<ul><li> Smith would later take this trope <em>beyond</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">eleven</a>. He had led Washington to a 6&#150;3 record in 2018 before suffering a severe leg fracture&#151;the same type that ended the NFL playing career of former Washington QB Joe Theismann in 1985&#151;in a game against the Houston Texans. While Theismann only needed one operation on his injured leg, further complications with sepsis that nearly killed Smith eventually led to him needing <em>17</em> of them. Two years and endless hours of rehab later, Smith made the Washington roster as a backup in 2020 and returned to the field in midseason. Given his situation, just playing again almost certainly qualifies as a resurrection, but he proceeded to put the icing on the cake by leading Washington to the NFC East division title after a 2-5 start.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0y2ck');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0y2ck" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0y2ck');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Granted, the NFC East was a historically poor division that year and the finished 7-9, but still.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Brian Vickers</strong>, the former record holder<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18t0f');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18t0f" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18t0f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he was 20 years and 19 days when he set the record; in 2014 Chase Elliott set a new record at 18 years, 11 months and 11 days</span> for youngest NASCAR national series champion (set in the second tier Xfinity Series, then known as the Busch Series, in 2003), has needed two of these just to stay active in the top tier Sprint Cup Series. His first derailment came when Hendrick Motorsports advanced him from their Xfinity program into the #25 entry on the Cup side, with the expectation that he would be able to improve the performance of the team from its long-time midpack stature to being on par with the team's other three entries (which all posted top ten points runs the year before). Vickers, however, put up results more in line with the previous several years of mediocrity in the #25, with his only win at Hendrick, in October 2006 at Talladega igniting a firestorm of controversy after he wrecked both Dale Earnhardt, Jr., the sport's most popular driver, and his own teammate Jimmie Johnson, which seemingly ended Johnson's already sputtering chances of winning a title.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22x3w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22x3w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22x3w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Before this race, Johnson hadn't recorded a top ten in the 2006 Chase, and had been wrecked at New Hampshire to start the postseason on the wrong foot; after however, Johnson would put together four runner ups and win to roar back and win his first of five straight and (as of 2014) six total titles</span> In 2007, he landed with start-up Red Bull Racing, and frequently struggled just to get the cars in the field. But when he could get into the field, he became a fairly reliable top ten finisher, and by 2009 he and Red Bull had their program strong enough for Vickers to win at Michigan and get them into the Chase field. However, things came unraveled again when Vickers was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs), pulmonary embolisms (clots from the DVT that had migrated to the lungs) <em>and</em> a hole in his heart in May 2010, which took him out of the car for the rest of the year. Red Bull underwent almost a complete regression without Vickers behind the wheel, such that when he returned in 2011, he was running severely limited equipment, at which point he began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">taking out his rage at his cars on his competitors</a> and basically blacklisted himself from any competitive openings when Red Bull imploded at the end of the year.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33jzw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note33jzw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33jzw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for that matter, even Red Bull's successor, BK Racing, which could've used someone with Vickers' still indisputable raw talent to improve their own program, passed on him, preferring run less talented but also less controversial drivers like Landon Cassill and Travis Kvapil instead</span> His second resurrection began when he got a part-time deal with a suddenly ascendant Michael Waltrip Racing in 2012, and posted five top tens (and three top fives) in eight starts. He got a slightly expanded deal the next year and won his third career race at New Hampshire that July, which eventually got him a two year full-time deal with MWR. However, MWR began to derail shortly after a cheating scandal (in which Vickers was marginally involved) led to the loss of major sponsor NAPA and a shutdown of one of the three teams, the #56, which was driven by Martin Truex, Jr.; Vickers' contract was for the #55 car, whose sponsor Aaron's stuck with the team. However, the loss of both revenue and real-world data from that third team has severely impacted MWR's ability to remain competitive, and Vickers has been unable to transcend this decline,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note44xgw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note44xgw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note44xgw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not helped by multiple recurrences of his health issues; the DVT came back and forced him out of the car in October 2013, when he was running the #55 after another of its drivers, Mark Martin, went to Stewart-Haas Racing to fill in for the injured Tony Stewart; meanwhile, a patch used to seal the hole in his heart would be rejected by his body in December 2014, which forced him to get heart surgery and sit out the first two races of 2015</span> which means he may require another resurrection once his contract with the team ends after 2015.
</li><li> <strong>Ron Harper</strong> is an unusual example of Career Resurrection. Playing for the Los Angeles Clippers in the early '90s, Harper was a consistent 20-point scorer and a solid defender. But he was very injury-prone and unhappy in what was then the NBA's equivalent of a jail sentence. Upon joining the Chicago Bulls for the 1994-95 season, Harper's scoring numbers and minutes took a huge tumble, but he had finally found happiness as an NBA player, staying healthy, finding a niche as the consummate defensive-oriented role player, and playing a key role in the Bulls' second three-peat. Harper later ended his career with two more championships with the Lakers. In all, he proved that sometimes, less is more when it comes to statistics.
</li><li> Similar to Harper's example in terms of "less is more," <strong>Bob McAdoo</strong> debuted in the NBA with a bang as a top rookie for the Buffalo Braves, a.k.a. the future LA Clippers, in 1973. He followed that up with three straight seasons as the NBA's scoring leader, consistently norming over 30 points per game. And while he still mostly averaged at least 25 points per game in the seasons that immediately followed, he bounced from team to team and developed a reputation as a malcontent by the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> rolled around. The then-mighty Los Angeles Lakers took a chance on him in the 1981-82 season, surrendering a lowly second-round draft pick to acquire the former scoring champ from the New Jersey Nets. Though he started only <em>one</em> game for the Lakers and never averaged more than 15 ppg, he became their "sixth man", providing quality minutes as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's backup at center and Kurt Rambis' backup at power forward. As for his rep as a malcontent, he proved to be a solid citizen and a locker room leader, not minding his reduced role at all.
</li><li> As of December 2019, <strong>Dwight Howard</strong> is enjoying a "less is more" Career Resurrection like Harper and McAdoo, and just like the latter, he's also doing it with the Lakers. Once a regular MVP candidate and arguably the best defensive big man in the NBA while playing for the Orlando Magic, Howard's first stint with the Lakers in 2012-13 was a disaster, one marred by bad chemistry with fellow superstar Kobe Bryant, among myriad other issues. This led to a six-year journeyman period where Howard played for the Houston Rockets, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, and finally the Washington Wizards, with each season yielding solid, albeit diminishing returns &mdash; with the Wizards, Howard played just 9 games due to injuries, but still averaged over 12 points and 9 rebounds a game. After returning to the Lakers as a free agent in the summer of 2019, Howard accepted a role off the bench and showed a noticeable increase in maturity, averaging career-lows across the board but serving as a meaningful component for the team that won the 2020 Finals.
</li><li> The man starting ahead of Howard on the Lakers, <strong>JaVale McGee</strong>, enjoyed a Career Resurrection of his own in recent years. After enjoying a solid first few years in the NBA, McGee eventually turned into meme fodder for his penchant for making boneheaded plays, becoming a two-time <em>Shaqtin' a Fool</em> MVP on <em>Inside the NBA</em> for all his troubles. He then became a certified NBA journeyman, bouncing from team to team and playing limited minutes, but his performance in the 2018 Playoffs for the championship-winning Golden State Warriors showed that he still had it in him to be a productive player. As such, the Lakers took a chance on him in the summer of 2018, as he was one of the few bright spots during LeBron James' disappointing first season in Los Angeles, averaging a career-high 12 points (also his first double-figure season since 2011-12) and finishing among the league's Top 10 in blocked shots. As of 2019-20, McGee's numbers have dipped a bit, but he still deserves credit for turning things around so late in his career.
</li><li> Once considered a potential heir apparent to John Elway, <strong>Tommy Maddox</strong> was a first-round pick of the Denver Broncos in 1992 who had fizzled out in Denver, the Los Angeles (later St. Louis) Rams, and the New York Giants and was out of the NFL by 1996. Leave it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s XFL to make Maddox into the league's sole MVP, and fuel his NFL comeback in 2001. He had two solid, if unspectacular seasons as the Pittsburgh Steelers' starting quarterback in 2002 (good enough for him to win the Comeback Player of the Year award) and 2003, before backing up new Steelers franchise QB Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 and 2005.
</li><li> <strong>Tommy John</strong>'s Career Resurrection in Major League Baseball was such a success that they named a surgical procedure after him. He was in the middle of one of his best pro seasons in 1974 when he suffered permanent damage to his ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing arm. This would have normally been a career-ending injury, but thanks to the surgery that would soon bear his name, he made a successful return to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1976 and played in three straight All-Star Games from 1978 to 1980. Even more remarkable, he ended up pitching in the majors until 1989, when he was already 46 years old! And, to take his resurrection <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, he won 164 of his 288 career wins <em>after</em> his surgery.
</li><li> Once one of the top young pitchers in the majors, <strong>Dennis Eckersley</strong> was a washed-up drunk by end of the 1986 MLB season, and apart from an appearance in the 1982 All-Star Game, he was mediocre from 1980 to 1986. But after successfully getting treatment for his alcoholism, "Eck" joined the Oakland Athletics in 1987, and was switched from starting pitcher to reliever. All he did was become one of the top closers in the majors all the way to the late '90s, winning both the American League Cy Young and MVP awards in 1992 and making the Hall of Fame in 2004 in his first year of eligibility.
</li><li> <strong>Rudy Distrito</strong> warmed the bench for the dominant Crispa Redmanizers in the Philippine Basketball Association in 1981 and 1982 before putting up solid numbers for a series of bad-to-mediocre teams from 1983 to 1986. His pro career was seemingly over in 1987, but crowd favorite Ginebra San Miguel signed him from the amateurs midway through the 1987 season, as he soon established his legacy as "The Destroyer", a combo guard who played with the ferocity of an NFL linebacker, and had a knack for hitting big shots.
</li><li> <strong>Bogs Adornado</strong> is considered one of the PBA's top shooters of all time, but he was pretty much washed up early in the 1980 season, demoted to the bench after he suffered a career-threatening injury in 1977. Released by Crispa after only a handful of games, he joined the U-Tex Wranglers for the rest of 1980, and promptly returned to his old form, making the Mythical 5 (the PBA's all-league team) that same season. He followed that up by becoming a three-time MVP in 1981 and continued putting up big numbers for most of the remainder of his career, which ended in 1987 at the age of 36.
</li><li> <strong>Nick Foles</strong> had a breakout year in 2013 where he had the NFL's best passer rating and touchdown to interception ratio, resulting in a playoff berth for the Philadelphia Eagles and a Pro Bowl selection for him. Unfortunately, he suffered an injury midway through 2014 and, in a very controversial decision, head coach and general manager Chip Kelly decided to trade him to the St. Louis Rams. Foles struggled with his new team and was eventually released. After spending one season with the Kansas City Chiefs as a backup to Alex Smith, Foles considered retiring until he was persuaded by new Eagles GM Roseman to come back to Philadelphia in 2017 and serve as a backup/mentor to their second-year starter Carson Wentz. In Week 14, Wentz, who was having an MVP season, went down with an ACL injury and Foles led the Eagles to clinch the division and eventually top seed in the NFC. Foles did very well in the playoffs and led the Eagles to the Super Bowl, scoring 34 points on the top-ranked Minnesota Vikings defense along the way. In Super Bowl LII, Foles out-dueled the great Tom Brady in a 41-33 shootout that brought the Eagles their first Super Bowl victory in team history. Foles was named the game's MVP and had several NFL teams attempting to work out a trade with the Eagles so he could become their starting quarterback. The trade never came, and after the 2018 season, the Eagles picked up the option year of his contract. He exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to buy out that option, becoming a free agent and signing a few weeks later with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</li><li> <strong>Os du Randt</strong>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56jvh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note56jvh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56jvh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Born Jacobus Petrus du Randt, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">known as Os</a>, Afrikaans for "ox".</span> a South African <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion">rugby</a> star whose career straddled the turn of the 21st century, pulled one of these off in 2003. A prop (front row of the scrum) with the mobility of much smaller players, he had previously come back from a torn ACL in secondary school that could have ended his career, going on to become part of the World Cup-winning Springboks in 1995 (immortalized in the 2009 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Invictus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Invictus">Invictus</a></em>, though he wasn't mentioned in it). Then in 1998, he suffered a hamstring injury, which led to a recurrence of his knee problems and forced him into retirement in 2000. He went back to his farm, but had trouble supporting his family without rugby, and also felt like he had unfinished business in rugby. Three years later, one of his former Boks teammates Rassie Erasmus, who had by then become coach of the Free State provincial side, offered him a return to the pitch. The next year, new South Africa head coach Jake White called him back for the Boks, and he continued to defy his age and injuries for another three years. His playing career ended with a second Rugby World Cup winners' medal in 2007, and he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2019.
</li><li> <strong>Dave Parker</strong>, who became a superstar with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1970's. At the end of the 1979 season (when he helped lead the Pirates to winning the World Series), he had a career .317 batting average (with two batting titles), was the 1978 NL MVP, and averaged 23 home runs and 17 stolen bases during the previous five seasons. He also had three Gold Gloves and was the 1979 All-Star Game MVP. However, the early 80's were a lost period for "The Cobra"; injuries and off-field issues (particularly cocaine addiction) took their toll on his numbers. By the time he signed with the Cincinnati Reds after the 1983 season, he had clearly worn out his welcome in Pittsburgh. However, once signed with the Reds, Parker got back in shape, cleaned himself up, and averaged 27 home runs per season during his 4-year tenure with Cincinnati (which included two more All-Star Game appearances). And if he was a bit well-travelled toward the end of his career, he was still a productive hitter who played for contenders seeking a veteran bat for their team.

<ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a></strong>. THE biggest wrestling star of the 1980s, Hogan's career stalled in the mid '90s after a combination of steroid allegations (promptly ridding him of his reputation for being a good role model for children), a disastrous movie career, and especially jumping to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> while still retaining the tired gimmick he'd held for a decade. Seen as old hat, boring and having gotten involved with a group of poor angles and feuds, Hogan's popularity was at an all-time low when the decision was finally made to turn him Heel by being a founding member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">nWo</a> faction. The move sparked interest in wrestling that it hadn't seen since the turn of the decade. Hogan once more became one of the biggest names in wrestling as a leader of the nWo.
<ul><li> Hogan's second career resurrection came after his legendary Wrestlemania 18 with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a>. Booked as a heel as part of an attempt of a nWo resurrection, the Toronto crowd decided they just didn't want to boo the legendary Hulkster. They cheered Hogan and booed The Rock. The Rock switched on the fly, wrestling a more heel style than he'd planned once the crowd turned on him. The next night, also in Toronto, Hogan cut a promo thanking the fans, who at times drowned him out with their ovation. Shortly thereafter Hall and Nash turned on him, and he started coming out in his signature red and yellow to "Real American" once again. He enjoyed a short resurgence and even recaptured the WWE World Title from Triple H in 2002. He briefly left WWE in 2003 after a contract dispute, but returned in 2005 and finished up with WWE in 2007. His in-ring career ended shortly thereafter.

The 1990s weren't much kinder to him than they were to Hogan. First, he suffered a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> during his time as "Macho King", his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MissElizabeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MissElizabeth">Miss Elizabeth</a> divorced him in 1992 and he had a falling out with Hogan. Afterwards, Randy took a lesser role in the company as a color commentator and ambassador, only wrestling part-time and never a big spectacle when he did. By 1994, Savage was ready to make a full-time return to the ring, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> wouldn't allow it because he believed Randy to be too old and broken down to compete with the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENewGenerationEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENewGenerationEra">New Generation</a>". Savage's contract expired in late October and he jumped ship to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> in December to resurrect his in-ring career. While his WCW run paled in comparison to his WWF heyday, he did put on some good matches, won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship four times, and joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">New World Order</a> to feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage">Diamond Dallas Page</a> in 1997, which was voted "Feud of the Year" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated and was DDP's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole">Star-Making Role</a>.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, he was acclaimed for his great ring work but run down for his drug use and constant showboating and backstage politics. In 1998, a bad back injury forced him out of the business and it looked like he was done. In 2002, after some replacement surgery and having undergone a religious conversion, HBK returned for "one more match" against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>. To the shock of everyone, Michaels wrestled a fantastic brawl that soon got him back into the swing of things. Indeed, it's arguable that Michaels was actually better <em>after</em> his injury than before it, winning titles and creating classic Match of the Year battles against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>, and more. Also, Michaels was hailed for changing his attitude, more accepting and giving the rub to others. He finally retired in 2010 but his comeback established his legacy from a one-time great to one of the true icons of the entire business.

In 2007, JD Star announced it was going out of business and the act of its final day was showcasing the resurrection of Ohka's career after her long absence to let everyone know she would be available in their absence.

A motivated Henry, backed with great booking as an unstoppable force and the best ring and mic work of his career, won the world title and SmackDown's ratings went up during his reign.

He then moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> and had an 18-month long winning streak that cemented him as one of the top stars in the company and his match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> led to TNA's highest PPV buy rate at that time(25,000). However, after that it all seemed to slowly fall apart for Joe as a disappointing World Title run, poor angles and a dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> had completely destroyed Joe's aura.

He hasn't reached his 2005-2006 peak, but Joe is quickly climbing back up the TNA ladder again.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a></strong> was one of the biggest stars in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> during the 1990s. However, after his transformation into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker">biker character</a> in 2000, his career went pretty much nowhere. Then, in 2004, he revived the "Deadman" gimmick for the first time since 1999. After that, his feuds became main-event storylines, he won the Royal Rumble and three world titles, and his streak at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em> has been built up as a big deal.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a></strong> was the hottest heel in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> for a period of time in 2009, but after he lost his World Heavyweight Championship to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, he found himself in mid-card angles involving the Straight Edge Society, where he was constantly beaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow">Big Show</a>. After he took over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus">New Nexus</a> in 2011, he got put in a boring, one-sided feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. As his WWE contract was about to expire, he was going to have one last feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>. Then, on June 27th, 2011, CM Punk sat down on the Raw stage and cut an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">worked shoot</a> promo attacking WWE, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>. This led to a classic match at that year's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a></em> where he won his first WWE Championship and left the company with the title. When he came back a week later, he proved himself to be the successor to John Cena's throne as the face of WWE. While he was never able to get that far, he still became one of the company's most popular superstars &mdash; to the point that fans are still cheering his name years his sudden departure in January 2014.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a></strong> was always considered the face and most recognizable wrestler of TNA by most but the company never truly got behind him as the main guy. After an ugly disagreement over his contract and tired of the way his character was done being looked over in favor of former WWE guys coming in despite doing everything for the company for eleven years, AJ left TNA in late 2013 with many thinking he&#146;d be back soon or he was going to retire. Instead, AJ heads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> and shocks many when he wins The IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the top prize in the promotion.

The Phenomenal One is Phenomenal once again. This translated to AJ Styles being signed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> in early 2016. He was allowed to keep his name, he went straight to the main roster, quickly became a main eventer and even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheFlyingPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheFlyingPigs">had a run with the WWE World Heavyweight Championship</a></em> all in less than a year despite being the antithesis of what Vince sees in potential stars. And to prove that he's not slowing down anytime soon, he won the World Title a second time in 2017 and held it <em>for a year</em>.

While people liked his act, his ring abilities were less than stellar. He was in an out of the company a few times, but the year 2010 saw him receiving rave reviews for his improvement. He departed again but a return in 2013 was hugely well-received - as he and his brother Cody Rhodes formed a tag team and were eventually the ones to dethrone The Shield for the Tag Team Championships (in the main event of Raw no less). Rather than becoming known as a faded Attitude Era star, it was widely accepted that Goldust was in the best shape of his career. From 2014-2018 however, his presence eventually dried up, especially after Cody quit the company. Instead of languishing with no direction however, he joined Cody in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a>, where at their inaugural pay-per-view <em>Double or Nothing</em>, he went back to being Dustin Rhodes and fought his brother in a gruesome and emotional match.

He did a series of jobs, including one at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> XII</em> where he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashMatch">squashed</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>, who notoriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">no-sold</a> his Pedigree finisher.

</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay">The New Day</a> is a classic example of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a>, the stable itself has proven to be a Career Resurrection for <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston">Kofi Kingston</a></strong>. Prior to The New Day, Kingston was strictly being used as a jobber to the stars, rarely winning and not having taken part in any storylines of note since his last United States title reign. Kingston would get another resurgence as a singles competitor on the February 12, 2019 edition of <em>SmackDown</em>. Being a literal last-minute replacement for the injured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MustafaAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MustafaAli">Mustafa Ali</a> in that year's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EliminationChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EliminationChamber">Elimination Chamber</a></em> PPV, a Gauntlet match was held to determine who will be the final entrant in the eponymous chamber. Kingston then proceeded to steal the show, first eliminating <em>reigning champion</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a>, followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a>, and finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a>. He would eventually lose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>, but the audience and his peers gave him a standing ovation for giving an excellent performance for over an hour. During said PPV, Kingston would steal the show again and became the final person eliminated by Daniel Bryan to retain the title, but the audience is on their seat during their match and once again gave Kingston a much bigger ovation for his showing. This ultimately led to him challenging for the title at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 35</em> and finally winning it, becoming the first African-born WWE Champion (along with becoming the thirtieth Triple Crown Champion and twentieth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GrandSlamChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GrandSlamChampion">Grand Slam Champion</a>) in history.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a></strong> floundered in mid-card hell after his brief run as a main eventer from 2010-2011. He made a face turn, which did nothing to refresh his character, then turned back heel under a Hollywood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrimaDonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrimaDonna">Prima Donna</a>-type gimmick and was given a "stunt double" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DamienSandow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DamienSandow">Damien Sandow</a>), that became more over than he was. 2016 was a turning point for him. His wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Maryse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Maryse">Maryse</a> returned to the company as his valet and he truly began to shine during the second Brand Extension, cutting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a> promo against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> that was so epic that even the smarkiest of smarks weren't sure if it was legit or not, followed by a series of well-received matches with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>, a feud with John Cena where both men (and their women) cut loose on each other with promo-work that wouldn't be out of place in the Attitude Era and a series of Intercontinental title reigns. The Miz, who was seen as a complete joke the previous year, once again became one of the more entertaining parts of WWE television.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a></strong>. After becoming a breakout star in the late '80s, Sting became WCW's top guy in the early '90s, winning several world titles and being voted Most Popular Wrestler of the year in 1990, 1991, and 1994. Sting's momentum slowed down once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> returned in 1993 after a two-year run in WWF, and took an even bigger hit when Hogan and Savage came aboard. As a result, Sting got lost in the shuffle, wrestling mostly in the midcard or as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RickyMorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RickyMorton">Ricky Morton</a> to Hogan, Savage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger">Lex Luger</a> in tag team matches. After Hogan's own resurrection (see above), Sting knew he had to change his character or else he'd suffer the same fate as pre-heel turn Hogan. He changed his look from a bleach-blond surfer dude to a dark, ghostly avenger reminiscent of Eric Draven from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow">The Crow</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentBob">stopped cutting promos</a> and took the fight directly to WCW's biggest threat via sneak attacks and theatrical mind tricks. He won the WCW World Heavyweight title at Starrcade 1997 (but not without controversy), which was his first world title reign since 1993, and was once again voted Most Popular Wrestler of the Year.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a></strong> was a fairly popular name in the indy scene for a while, but he was widely considered a B-lister at best and never had anywhere near the same reputation as the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Bryan Danielson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Claudio Castagnoli</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Steen</a>. Once he left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> in 2010, Omega became largely an afterthought in the minds of most wrestling fans. This all changed when he arrived in New Japan during the mid-2010s, where he quickly became a standout member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a> and provided five-star matches with the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada">Kazuchika Okada</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a>, including two with Okada that went <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">above</a></em> the five-star scale, and essentially becoming arguably the hottest name on the industry outside WWE.
</li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Hardy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Boyz</a></strong>: were one of WWF's top tag teams in the Attitude Era and would pursue solo careers in the 2000s, but both men were derailed by their personal issues (various injuries, Jeff's drug addictions, and Matt's poor handling of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">his girlfriend</a> having an affair with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">best friend</a>) and left WWE for TNA at the end of the decade. The low point for both men was 2011, when Jeff showed up to a TNA world title match against Sting doped to the gills (forcing Sting to shoot-pin him after about a minute) and Matt was fired due to a drinking problem, subsequently faking a suicide note, leading the wrestling fandom to completely turn on them both. However, both men spent the next few years cleaning up their act and their "Broken Hardys" gimmick redeemed them in the eyes of the fans, enough for WWE to give them another chance and re-hire them in 2017, with a RAW Tag Team Championship run to boot.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a></strong> made his WWF debut in 1999 with a lot of hype behind him, as he was the first Olympic Gold Medalist to enter a pro wrestling ring. Kurt lived up to the hype, winning dozens of championships and putting on many classic bouts. As injuries and addictions took their toll on him, WWE fired Angle in 2006 after he refused to go to rehab. He was quickly snatched up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> and while he was arguably more successful there than in WWE, many fans grew tired of Angle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">constantly hogging the spotlight</a> and his personal life went even further down the shitter: his wife Karen left him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> and he was arrested several times for drug and alcohol-related offenses. Angle's second wife, Giovanna, convinced Kurt to enter rehab in 2013 and he dedicated himself to getting clean. Kurt left TNA in early 2016 and returned to WWE the following year, with a headlining Hall of Fame induction, a stint as RAW's general manager, and a return to the ring in October to fill in for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> in a 3-on-5 handicap TLC match. Angle proved he still had it, and his past struggles have been forgiven.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a></strong> was arguably WCW's greatest pet project in the 1990s. Stepping into a wrestling ring straight out of the NFL, Goldberg quickly became a hot act despite his minimal ring ability, generic look (that was essentially a ripoff of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>) and lack of mic skills. What he did possess was intensity, charisma and a devastating Spear/Jackhammer combo that put 173<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6xod5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6xod5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6xod5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the actual number is disputed</span> wrestlers on their backs for the 1-2-3, while picking up a WCW United States and later Heavyweight championship along the way. Things started going downhill when he lost the championship to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a> via interference from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a> and a taser. Goldberg floundered around for a bit before being given an ill-advised heel turn at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a>. <br><br>Following the closure of WCW and a brief stint in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a>, Goldberg signed with WWE in 2003, which, despite a three-month world title reign, didn't do much for Goldberg or WWE. Goldberg's contract expired the next year and after both he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> were booed out of the arena at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> XX, he retired from wrestling never to be seen again. At least not until 2016, when it was revealed that he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus">Pre-Order Bonus</a> character for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WWEVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WWEVideoGames">WWE 2K17</a></em>, which led to fans speculating that Goldberg might return to the ring, especially since this is the deal that led Sting to do the same a few years prior and Goldberg stated in an interview that he'd like to have one last match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch">for his wife and son</a>. The fans were proven right as Goldberg announced that he would return one last time in order to challenge Lesnar again, promptly squashing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a> right in the middle of the ring, to thunderous approval from the fans. Goldberg extended the "last match" into a "last run", eliminating Lesnar from the Royal Rumble, defeating Kevin Owens for the Universal championship at <em>FastLane</em>, then dropping it to Lesnar at WrestleMania 33. Although fans turned on Goldberg again following the title win, and actually cheered for Lesnar after he beat Goldberg, Goldberg appeared the next night and thanked the fans for his last run while leaving the door open for another in the future. He was announced as the inaugural inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2018. <br><br>Goldberg's WWE return also seems to have revitalized his acting career and mainstream presence, with him appearing in the aptly titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs">The Goldbergs</a></em>, <em>Nine Legends</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanSatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanSatan">American Satan</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrandTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrandTour">The Grand Tour</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em> and a few commercials.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a></strong> made his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> debut in 2002 and quickly became one of its most prolific main event players. However, Lesnar eventually became burnt out due to WWE's hectic schedule and left in 2004 alongside Goldberg. After a failed NFL career, he returned to wrestling for New Japan, which was a disaster second only to Tadao Yasuda's run in the company, and had a successful run in UFC despite being dismissed as a "fake wrestler". Lesnar returned to WWE in 2012 and quickly reminded both fans and wrestlers alike why he was such a force to be reckoned with.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a></strong> was a solid midcard act in the early to mid-90s, but once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a> kicked in, fans turned on him in droves and he was fired from WWF in 1999. The fandom's ire for Jarrett only worsened as he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> in both WCW and TNA (the latter company being one he co-founded with his father Jerry). Even the death of his wife, Jill, and a reduced role in TNA did little to repair this damage since it was soon discovered that Jarrett was having an affair with Kurt Angle's then-wife Karen. It wasn't until Jarrett left TNA and mended fences with WWE that people started openly admitting to liking him again. His Hall of Fame induction in 2018, followed by a return to a WWE ring in 2019, cemented his resurrection.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TonySchiavone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TonySchiavone">Tony Schiavone</a></strong> was WCW's main announcer throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MondayNightWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MondayNightWars">Monday Night Wars</a>. After WCW was bought out by the WWF in 2001, Tony stepped away from the business apart from brief stints in XWF and TNA, and seemed to consider his wrestling career <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>. However, in 2017, he started a podcast with Conrad Thompson called "What Happened When" where the two discussed Tony's memories of WCW.

Then, in 2017, Nintendo released a hotly-debated successor to the Wii U, and their reception and popularity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">switched</a> right on a dime.
<ul><li> It's not the first time this has happened to Nintendo. Following the less than stellar sales of the Gamecube, many analysts and journalists had given Nintendo up for dead (despite Nintendo's more than ample cash reserves and handheld dominance), and there were numerous "experts" predicting Nintendo would soon leave the home console market and begin to make 3rd party games. Nintendo's next console, the Wii, only went on to revolutionize gaming, went on to sell over 100 million units, and a testament to it's wide-spread appeal, Sony and Microsoft rushed to make clumsy copycat attempts at replicating the motion-controls that made the Wii such a huge success.

This involved the development and release of several licensed games under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a> that were seen as quite sub-par coming from them, hitting the absolute low point with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>: Mutants in Manhattan</em> as well as the subsequent cancellation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scalebound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scalebound">Scalebound</a></em>.

Fortunately the next game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em>, was not only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a> for creative director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaroYoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaroYoko">Taro Yoko</a> but also a massive critical and financial success, saving the company from bankruptcy and restoring their reputation in the eyes of gamers.

At 2000, however... they suffered financial troubles thanks to their underdog status and the decline of arcade scene thus they had to declare bankruptcy, selling some of their assets to the Korean companies and entered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. They came back a bit as 'SNK Playmore', but their games tends to be either a hit or miss and not exactly packing the similar punch as before, so they also had to produce mini-games, mobile games and pachinko titles. It took them 10+ years to eventually re-gather their resources and once again became just 'SNK' and released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a> XIV</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Samurai Shodown</a> (2019)</em>, which gained great acclaim and earned them a spot in the EVO championship series, something that they never quite achieved before.

</li><li> <strong>Teyon</strong> really did themselves no favors when they released the universally panned <em>Rambo: The Video Game</em>, a title that was bashed to high heavens, and the studio, themselves already seen as a no-name, fell even further from grace, practically to the point of being considered a shovelware developer. Then in 2019, out of nowhere, they proceeded to release <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerminatorResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerminatorResistance">Terminator Resistance</a></em> with virtually no marketing or fanfare. Despite a mixed reception from professional critics, the general gaming populace embraced the game with open arms, praising its gameplay, atmosphere, and clear respect for the franchise, with many even considering it to be better than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorDarkFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorDarkFate">the film it released alongside</a>. Needless to say, it more than repaired Teyon's reputation, further helped by their solid support of the title in the months that followed, with the announcement of an enhanced edition for the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS5">PS 5</a> being greeted with solid approval.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWeek">The Week</a></em> follows a once-beloved TV show host who's now stuck doing radio. The film ends with him being offered a new TV deal, but it's left open whether he'll take it or not.
</li><li> <strong>Simon Trent</strong> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Beware the Gray Ghost" was an actor known for starring as the titular vigilante in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em>The Gray Ghost</em>, which would inspire Bruce to become Batman later on. However, the show was subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">Keep Circulating the Tapes</a> as a fire destroyed the studio that produced it, so the public largely forgot about it. Simon Trent is now old, broke and hasn't had an acting job in a while due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting">Typecasting</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">Reality Subtext</a>, as he's voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamWest">Adam West</a>) living in a run-down apartment and barely paying the bills by selling his <em>Gray Ghost</em> memorabilia to collectors. After an unknown criminal begins imitating crimes from the show, Batman convinces Trent to help him solve the mystery. After the culprit is defeated, Trent is revered as a real hero, <em>The Gray Ghost</em> finally gets a home video release (as Trent had copies of the original episodes stashed away) and Trent's career is presumably revived.
</li><li> <strong>Mariya Yamamoto</strong> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShiningSongStarnova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShiningSongStarnova">Shining Song Starnova</a></em> was once a member of Quasar, Japan&#146;s largest and most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> group, but despite spending almost ten years with them she never achieved enough notoriety to make it into Quasar&#146;s prestigious front row unit and found herself constantly overshadowed by much younger girls, and was ultimately fired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">for being too old</a>. By the time the story begins she&#146;s become a chain-smoking alcoholic working various jobs that she hates while struggling to find more idol work. Joining the newly-formed idol group Starnova helps to resurrect her career: she experiences a popularity resurgence in any route and in her own route <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she achieves her lifelong dream of becoming Japan&#146;s most popular idol and performing live in the Tokyo Dome</span>.
