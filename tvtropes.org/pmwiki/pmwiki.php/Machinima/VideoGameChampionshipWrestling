Like "real" wrestling it is filled with storylines, rivalries and theatrics, but, unlike "real" wrestling, few if any of the fight results are actually scripted, leading to strange twists and upsets that would never happen in the real world. And, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">the backgrounds and abilities of the characters don't necessarily transfer over into the ring</a>, some very strange things can happen. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">A Saiyan</a> can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">jobber</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Raphael</a> can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Gabe Newell</a> can fight (and in some cases win) a bout with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Ganon</a>.

The wiki now calls this early era, <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Pre-Seasons_(Female_Division):_The_Belt_Heist">"The Belt Heist"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> The real first season, <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Season_1_%28Female_Division%29:_The_Search_for_Sandiego">"The Search for Sandiego"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> began after the end of the <em>VGCW</em>'s Great Tournament. Bryn McMahon managed to secure the Female Division before Dracula took control of the <em>VGCW</em> by force. Since then, he became preoccupied with Carmen's theft of the original belt, so he arranged for a meeting with Sandiego in order to trick her into coming back with the belt. Of course though, Carmen had other plans. Thanks to Bryn's lack of business smarts and an artifact that she recently stolen, she managed to get the new belt, take over the <em>WVGCW</em> by <em>legal</em> force, and successfully frame Bryn for the theft of said artifact.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Season_2_%28Female_Division%29:_Edutainment_Embezzlement">Season 2, "Edutainment Embezzlement",<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> began on 17 July 2013 after a "shork" break. This season covered what happened to the <em>WVGCW</em> during the reign of V.I.L.E.C.W. It ended with the season finale, "Breakdown", on 4 October 2013 with Carmen Sandiego exposed by Lightning, and betrayed by Dr. Gero, Mavis Beacon, Daisy, and Shadow Peach for lynching on their payments. A secret escape tunnel beneath the wrestling ring allowed her to get away, letting her live to steal another day. Finally, Bryn returns briefly to pass the title of GM to none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">"The Saint"</a>.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Season_3_(Female_Division):_The_Saints_Go_Marching_In">Season 3, "The Saints Go Marching In"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, debuted with a special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">Halloween Episode</a> on 30 October 2013. Like the sixth season of the main <em>VGCW</em>, there was not much to the plot at first, but Carmen did return to beat up Lightning, and there is a lot more purple in WVGCW right now. However, unlike the main <em>VGCW</em>, Bryn was still using <em>WWE '13</em> when the season began. The 5 December 2013 episode of <em>WVGCW</em> marked the end of the <em>WWE '13</em> era, and Byrn switched to <em>WWE 2K14</em> on the 27 December 2013 episode. The season finale was scheduled to end on 24 February 2013 with <em>Breakdown 2/3</em> (somewhat a pun: the second <em>Breakdown</em> show, which ends the third season of <em>WVGCW</em>, with a card dominated by two-out-of-three falls matches), but due to Bryn's PS3 crashing and him needing to rewrite the show, the finale was on hiatus until 14 March 2014, which resulted with Samus, through Franziska von Karma's aid, manipulating the legal system into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">seizing power as co-GM</a> alongside the Saint. At the same time, the inaugural Casualette championship ends up being won by "Steak Cold" Chie Satonaka, though Carmen Sandiego tired to steal Chie's spot. Carmen was saved from her embezzlement charges via the Saint, who was a Carmen fan, and given a new WVGCW contract. Finally, Ayla successfully defended her WVGCW title against Bayonetta, preventing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">New Witch Order</a> stable from walking out with the titles.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Season_4_%28Female_Division%29:_Other_GM">Season 4, "Other GM"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> deals with the ongoing power struggle between Samus and the Saint for control of WVGCW. To further complicate matters, Franziska gets run over by an unknown assailant, prompting Gumshoe and newcomers Maya Fey and Ema Skye to investigate the matter fully. Other plots include the New Witch Order's ongoing goal of capturing the titles, while Chie and Elizabeth launch their own investigation over who or what is controlling Shadow Peach. The season ended on July 4, 2014 with Samus seizing full control of the show prior to Breakdown due to the Saint conveniently disappearing while the suspect who ran over Franzizka was revealed to be Lara Croft, who had been trying to target Samus. Lara gets arrested but not before promising to divulge information to Franziska. Meanwhile, the New Witch Order scores a decisive victory over the alliance of Terra, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Lucina</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a> at Breakdown. At the same time Chie and Elizabeth venture into the Shadow World and after confronting Shadow Chie and defeating her, manages to free the real Peach from her prison before vanquishing Shadow Peach for good, after which Elizabeth parts ways to go and free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Makoto</a> from the Great Seal. Finally, Chell defeats defending champion Ayla for the WVGCW championship, making history by becoming the second double champion in the company after Ganondorf and the first in the women's division overall.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Season_5_(Female_Division)%3A_Tag_Team_Turnover">Season 5, "Tag Team Turnover"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, picked up with Samus continuing to solidify her control over the company, as Franzizka interrogated Lara Croft for her role in the hit and run from last season. Meanwhile, RPGenie went back to the drawing board to level grind experience in order to gain another shot at defeating the New Witch Order. The Season ended on January 2nd, 2015, with the New Witch Order imploding on itself when Sindel walks out due to Gruntilda and Bayonetta's consistent focus on getting one over RPGenie, and Terra, who had earlier challenged Grunty to a final showdown, not only won, but literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">beat the beauty out of her</a>, reverting her back to her old self. Meanwhile, Chell ends up losing both of her Championships in one evening, and things take an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">even worse turn</a> for her when Samus announces her new Assistant: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/GLaDOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/GLaDOS">GLaDOS</a>.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Season_6_%28Female_Division%29:_Tests_Are_Not_Dead">Season 6, "Tests Are Not Dead"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, picked up on the events of Breakdown F.I.V.E. Turns out Samus and the Saint were actually looking for a supervisor to watch over the company so they could get back to their wrestling career, and GLaDOS applied almost immediately. As a result, while the two GMs still have their jobs, GLaDOS is in charge of match booking (or "testing" as she prefers to call it) and turned the arena into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>-esque Test Chamber. The Season is also notable because this time the matches are pre-recorded rather than live, so BRYN does a lot more work on the actual production of the show, such as inserting GLaDOS into plot areas, different loading screen styles, etc. The Season ended on July 28, 2015, where GLaDOS was temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHerOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHerOwnPetard">Hoist by Her Own Petard</a> by getting her neurotoxin emitters filled with pure fire by none other than her own call-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">Jinx</a>. Samus came in after her defeat, but decided afterwards that being GM simply isn't worth it anymore and passed the torch down to Lightning. Along with this, a group of unlikely talent came to the newly christened GM claiming they're time travelers: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Toadette</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Joanna Dark</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GravityRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GravityRush">Kat</a>, and their leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Lucca Ashtear.</a> Lucca convinced Lightning to add the "Future Four" to the roster to help stave off the threat that looms in the future. Meanwhile, the night of the season finale ended with the first ever Women's Royal Rumble, thanks to a bit of hacking on the part of a few key fans of the show. At the end, the winner of the very first rumble was none other than Chie, who managed to eliminate entrant number 40, Sindel, to become the #1 contender for the championship.</li><li> Season 7, "Paradigm Shift", is a bit of a return to form after the last few crazy plot threads in the division. For once the show has an actual, competent General Manager in the form of Lightning, who is doing everything she can to get the show back on track and act as a stern but fair boss in the process. This season is notable for being the first one with a full creative team behind it rather than one person&mdash;BRYN recruited long time VGCW watchers Doomknight and Nottyrose to act as aides in both writing and recording. With this also brought about a shift in focus for the show&mdash;less on a single, overarching plot and more about individual feuds and title matches. Major plot developments this season include longtime underdog tag team The Summoners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turning heel</a> with Rydia using her Money In The Bank briefcase to ambush then Co-Op champions RPGenie and become the new champions along with her partner Sheena, Chie <em>finally</em> winning the big one in a triple threat against the weasley champion Cate and red-hot contender Jill, and the return of the infamously hated and feared Ivy. This season also kicked off the now regular schedule of three PPVs a season happening roughly every four episodes. The season ended on June 7, 2016 at Breakdown 777, headlined by the feud-blowing Hell in a Cell Co-Op Championship match between RPGenie and champions The Summoners, with the stipulation that if RPGenie loses they have to disband. In the end, The Summoners won, and the stable of RPGenie was permanently dissolved, paving the way for the new top heels of the company after Chie won the belt from Cate.</li><li> Season 8, &#147;The Mission&#148;, was the final season BRYN worked on before retiring from the show. In many ways it was a passing of the torch, concluding many long-running plot threads BRYN had built up over the course of the series, including the nebulous "mission" that the Boss had been building to the entire series; but for the most part the series continued its focus shift to be more about individual feuds rather than one overarching plot thread. Highlights of this season include the second female Royal Rumble, recurring backstage assaults by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">SA-X</a>, the introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">Morrigan</a> putting a wrench into the beloved Duke/Cooking Mama romance, and several high profile newcomers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Aqua</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelyDefault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelyDefault">the team of Agnes Oblige and Edea Lee</a>, also known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelySecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelySecond">Bravely Second</a>. The season ended on June 3rd, 2017 with Breakd&infin;wn, and ended with newcomer champions all around: R. Mika won the Casualette Championship against Poison, Bravely Second won the Co-Op Championship against Dragon Ball GG, and Sophitia won the WVGCW Championship against Lucina. It also concluded all plot threads Bryn left behind with The Mission, allowing the new team more room to follow up with new plot threads of their own.</li></ul><br><strong>Doom/Notty/Nap Era</strong><p></p><ul><li> Season 9, "End Of Time", began on July 22nd, 2016 and was the final season of WVGCW held in <em>2K14</em> after its long, lengthy dominance as the show's game of choice. It was shorter than most seasons in order to accelerate the process of game conversion and wrap up a final overarching plot thread. This season was the first to feature Doomknight and Nottyrose as the lead creative forces as well as a new creative team member to fill in the spot BRYN left behind&mdash;Nap1400. Beyond the changes to the creative team, this season was also the climax of the "Future Four" plot thread started in Season 6. Lucina and the Future Four eventually teamed up after butting heads over how to find the catalyst of their bad future, with their only clue being "a great magic". That catalyst turned out to be, of all people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Rinoa</a>, or more specifically the sorceress Ultimecia sleeping inside of her. She was awakened by the villain of the season, <em>EDBW</em> call-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus">Medusa</a>, as a way to create more souls to fill the underworld. This season would <em>not</em> end at Breakdown .9 as is usual for the series, where the new team of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Peacock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64">Adeleine</a>, the Nation of Animation, became the new Co-Op Champions, Aigis won the Casualette Championship against Mika, and Sophitia defended the WVGCW championship against Morrigan. Instead, the season ended on October 6, 2017 on a special bonus episode called "Fated Hour", where the Future Four and Lucina attempted to defeat Ultimecia and in the process, have the game completely convert into <em>2K17</em>. However, the show would go on to be saved not just by the Future Four and Lucina, but also by, of all people, Carmen Sandiego, after being provoked in the Twitch chat by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">a mysterious new moderator named "ptalibaba" posting a link to a calling card saying that her distorted desires will be stolen.</a> With the day finally saved and no more world destroying threats on the horizon, the entire roster is free to return to everyday squabbles, and Carmen decides to cut a deal with this new figure to learn their trade secrets&#133;</li><li> Season 10, "The Dawn of a New Age", is the first season done entirely in <em>2K17</em>, and featured a total overhaul. Almost a quarter of the roster from the <em>2K14</em> was culled, but since the show was now running on a game with functional CAW servers, the season introduced a <em>lot</em> of newcomers in their place. The first episode alone had three newcomer matches featuring three characters from games that came out too late to be in <em>2K14</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">D.Va</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">2B</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">"Panther"</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">real name unknown</a>), and the newcomers continued until the roster size expanded back to its old size. In addition, the show went back to a weekly schedule as opposed to the previous bi-weekly schedule, with the compromise that every other week would be a shorter "half-episode" that features no plot. Notable plot developments this season include Franziska von Karma taking over as general manager after Lightning lost her job in a career-threatening match against Jill, Lightning getting murdered and subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">getting brought back to life</a>, the fallout of the Future Four now that their main job was done, the begrudged relationship between Carmen, Panther, and Panther's friend "Oracle", and the mostly one-sided feud between Daisy and newcomer Rosalina, who Daisy perceived to be a threat to her friendship with Peach. The season ended on June 19th, 2018 with Breakdown X, which featured the debut of fan-voted newcomer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtella">Nero Claudius</a>, the reveal of Lightning's killer being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa">Junko Enoshima</a> taking over KOS-MOS's programming, Morrigan defeating Aqua for the Casualette Championship, the Nation of Animation defending against newcomers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Asuka Kazama and Lili de Rochefort</a>, and WVGCW Champion Edea Lee doing the impossible and defending the title in a six way Hell in a Cell match against Rydia, Sheena, Ivy, 2B, and Terra.</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> for Breakdown X, it was revealed that Franziska von Karma hired Carmen Sandiego to steal something for her. However, Carmen being Carmen, she decided to run off with this something for herself and provoked von Karma to chase her for it. This ended up being the underlying plot thread for Season 11, "Where in the World is <em>WVGCW</em>?", which started on August 21st, 2018. Much like Season 12 of <em>VGCW</em>, every episode took place in a different arena based on the home locations of several members of the roster, examples including Dream Land for Adeleine, Tokyo for the Phantom Thieves, Meltokio for Sheena, and 11945 A.D. for 2B. Alongside the plot between von Karma and Carmen, other developments included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Sypha Belnades</a> becoming Ms. Money in the Bank and using it to perform a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelDoubleTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelDoubleTurn">Face/Heel Double-Turn</a> between her and former heel champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">Bad Girl</a>, Peach forcing Daisy to work with Rosalina by&#133;"getting kidnapped" to leave them on their own, and most importantly, the mid-season conversion to <em>2K19</em> during the season's second PPV, Nero Fest. The season ended on April 23rd, 2019 with Breakdown XI held in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">the Opera House</a>&mdash;in this PPV, Daisy and Rosalina defended their new Co-Op Championship against Lightning and her partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Lenneth</a>, Casualette Champion Cate Archer defended her title against a now focused Rinoa, and WVGCW Champion Sypha further proved she wasn't a fraudulent champion by defending against newcomer and <em>Genesis 1</em> winner Velvet Crowe. As for von Karma and Carmen, von Karma eventually learned the hard way from Jade that the roster was fed up with her wild goose chase and she didn't need whatever Carmen stole to become (in her words) "a perfect GM." She relented, Carmen escaped one last time after losing to Panther, and von Karma brought everybody back to the old <em>WVGCW</em> arena to prepare for the next season.</li><li> Season 12 started on May 28, 2019, and is currently ongoing. Some of the plot threads currently happening include Adeleine painting a portrait of all the people she and Peacock defeated as champions, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">forgetting that her paintings come to life</a> and causing the roster to be overrun by block bodied versions of themselves; Sophitia finally snapping after R.

Still run by VGCW: ARENA's host, Belmont Legend, the show, just like the other VGCW Network shows, was A.I. vs. A.I., and featured a roster featuring some of VGCW: ARENA's superstars, as well as a number of brand new competitors. Like ARENA, plot segments were still made by participating fans, and aired every other Sunday.</p><p></p><ul><li> The first season came to an end on March 29th 2016 with BWA's End Game equivalent, Final Round, and all the first champions would finally be crowned.

It featured a complete overhaul of the block format&mdash;instead of two gigantic blocks which had every wrestler face each other once in a vanilla singles match, the sixteen wrestlers were instead split into four blocks of four, with each one being named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCardMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCardMotifs">the suit of a playing card.</a> Every wrestler would face every other competitor in their block <em>twice</em>: once in a standard vanilla singles, and once in a gimmick match, with the vanilla match granting more points than the gimmick match.

The show used to completely lack plot aside from a few fun promos the community members made, but the promos eventually developed into its own personal plot completely detached from VGCW.

Newly christened GM Gary Oak forms a new Elite Four consisting of himself, Illidan and EDBW callups Miles Edgeworth and Senator Armstrong. At the same time, someone had began threatening various wrestlers backstage and Travis found himself at the center of the controversy.

While they're dealing with the GameShark, The season also deals with multiple continued storylines, including Red and Illidan's continued struggles against Gary Oak and his biased management against them, and the impending explosion of Groose's Gang of Bullies. The season concluded on December 1, 2015 with Heavy defeating his former comrade for the Casual Championship, Haggar gaining revenge for Guile's attacks as the leader of the Ring Rangers back in Season 7 by making him say "I Quit!", Red &amp; Illidan uniting as Shadow Ball Valley to finally earn some payback on both Gary &amp; Armstrong by defeating them in a Tag Team Match, and Segata facing a GameShark possessed Donkey Kong in the entity's dimension (WWE '13), while Octodad attempts to hold off Break Man, who sought the GameShark's power for himself. After both men are able to prevail over their opponents, the GameShark tries to pull the entire island under, killing everyone in the process. With no other choice, Segata chooses to dive into the Sea of Data and reenters the Gameshark's lair to prevent it from escaping into the real world, forever locked in eternal combat, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">effectively sacrificing himself in the process</a>. Donkey Kong also retires to stay on the island and stand vigil over the GameShark in case it returns. Meanwhile, Break Man learns from an unknown perpetrator that the GameShark was a prototype and seeks to learn more, while Armstrong makes preparations to seize control of the company from Gary.

Bison and his newly-reborn Shadaloo plot to eliminate the weak and claim VGCW for himself. Things continued to unravel throughout the Season all the way up to End Game X2 on August 2nd 2016, where it was revealed that M. Bison had kidnapped Captain Falcon and using him to create the army of Blood Falcons; unimpressed with his work during the season however, his benefactor, Senator Armstrong, and his associates Asura &amp; Flint cut their ties with the Dictator. Out of time and options, Bison absorbed the Blood Falcons and powered up, intending to destroy VGCW itself, it taking the combined efforts of the Birds of Prey to defeat him... with the cost of Captain Falcon's life the price to pay for his defeat. The true reveal was yet to come however, as it was revealed that Senator Armstrong was, in fact, the leader of a group of a Private Military Company made up of wrestlers to find some of the best that both VGCW and WVGCW has to offer and create a new world for everyone. Some of these individuals include Asura &amp; Flint, Sho Minamimoto, Miles Edgeworth (in possession of the Triforce of Power), Android 18 &amp; Dr. Gero, The Boss, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/GLaDOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/GLaDOS">GLaDOS</a>. On the Championship side of things, The Mavericks became 2-Time Co-Op Champions, Dr. Wily defended his Casual Championship against Guybrush Threepwood in convincing fashion, and Phoenix Wright &#147;shocked&#148; the world by vanquishing his old enemy Dracula (for the third time) to finally become VGCW Champion, even managing to escape an attempted cash-in by Ganondorf.<ul><li> The list of locations that VGCW visited throughout the Season were:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mushroom Kingdom</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">Mute City</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Green Hill Zone</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Midgar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Transylvania</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Skull Castle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Japanifornia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a> (A.K.A. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Island</a> that was the setting for Season 11), WVGCW HQ, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Indigo Plateau</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">New Pork City</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Tenkaichi Budokai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToejamAndEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToejamAndEarl">Funkotron</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Hyrule</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Aperture Science</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Thailand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Thailand">Thailand</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://forum.vgcw.net/topic/30049482/1/">Season 13: Unnatural Selection<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, premiered on October 25, 2016 and ultimately served as the final season of VGCW. The main story dealt with Armstrong, having moved the show to a subterranean World Marshal facility, striving to create a weapon to defeat The Patriots using any means necessary while further wresting control from Gary Oak. Key events this season were Vegeta finally winning the VGCW title legitimately only for Ganondorf to immediately cash in and become a four-time VGCW Champion; Dr. Wily continuing his meteoric Casual Championship reign; Zangief&#146;s &#147;Iron Curtain Jerk&#148; streak finally coming to an end at the hands of Bowser; The Mavericks continuing to win in entertaining yet odd ways as if to spite the very humans watching the show; Salvation Ops. planning on how to best confront Armstrong; and a Triple Crown finally occurring when Wily and Ganondorf squared off in a title unification match.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, Armstrong&#146;s efforts to battle The Patriots would be turned against him, as his secret weapon, the Game Genie, was captured by them and effectively used as their main body. Also sporting the Triforce of Power, taken from Miles Edgeworth, the Game Genie was seemingly unstoppable. However, Armstrong was able to buy time through a proposal that put his ideology to the test: VGCW would discover the undisputed strongest person on the roster and then send them to do battle with the Game Genie. The Genie agreed and VGCW Survival was underway. Fans voted on anyone (singles champions excluded) to enter this event, and the top 36 were put into six six-man matches, with the winners facing off in a final six-man match. Amazingly (and hilariously), perpetual jobber Zubaz won the event and became the final contender for VGCW&#146;s last title match against the Triple Crown champion. On the Co-Op side of things, The Sayians defeated The Mavericks then confronted all-time favorites Gamecenter FU to determine the greatest tag team of VGCW. The Game Genie confronted the undisputed VGCW Champion and Co-op Champions, and in the end the entire roster simultaneously battled the hacking device incarnate in a crowning moment of ingenuitive editing skills. With The Game Genie vanquished, and The Patriots along with it, VGCW was saved and kayfabe continued its existence as the series came to an end.</p><p>Also, Doom Guy "debuted" in the last five seconds of the show, and the post-show Q&amp;A saw Ganondorf and Bowser finally battle in 2K14. </p></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>EDBW</em> (<em>Extreme Dudebro Wrestling</em>)&nbsp;</div><div id="folder7" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">The third addition to <em>VGCW</em>, which started near the end of January 2014 and is hosted by "The Other <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/JohnDudebro">John Dudebro<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">hence the gratuitous name</a>. This spin-off originally served as a way for people to have fun with the characters that for one reason or another didn't make it into (or were removed from) the VGCW canon, pitting them in matches against each other so that their potential wasn't completely wasted, as well as to succeed <em>SNST</em>, basically <em>VGCW</em> before it had plot. While it started off as non-canon, the show retroactively became the canon developmental show (not unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a></em>) after former competitor and graduate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">Travis Touchdown</a> acknowledged its existence during his VGCW run, and started getting its own plot scenes midway through Season 4 after <em>SNST One Night Stand</em>, where it was revealed that the General Manager for EDBW all this time had been Teddie, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa">Monokuma</a> suddenly showed up and had been appointed off-screen as the Co-GM. Major plotlines, besides the odd duo of the Co-GMs, include Shovel Knight unwittingly becoming a servant of Arthas with King Dedede wanting to free Shovel Knight, a feud between Sam and Max and the team of Scratch and Grounder, and Ness trying to figure out why no one seems to remember Lucas, despite the latter being a former EDBW Champion, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalLegend">Eddie Riggs</a> made a surprise return at a Royal Rumble in order to reclaim the EDBW Championship from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Liquid Snake</a> on behalf of the developmental roster. The season concluded on November 24, 2015 with Dedede failing to overcome Arthas who retained control over Shovel Knight, while Sam &amp; Max prevail over Team Bean Machine to become the inaugural EDBW Co-Op champions. Lucas revealed that he personally wiped Ness and the others memories of him due to his feelings of abandonment before destroying him in a Ring of Fire match. The season also had some controversy when newcomer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Morrigan</a> used her magic to help win the EDBW Women's Championship from the popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">Sophitia Alexandra</a>. Finally, Eddie succeeded in his mission to wrest the title from Liquid's hands in the main event of the show, essentially saving the division. After the credits however, it was revealed that Monokuma is in league with someone else, and thus beginning Phase 2 of their plan.<p></p><ul><li> Season 5, titled Lockdown, deals with the aftermath of Killscreen IV and the aforementioned Phase 2; although not starting straight-away, Monokuma eventually takes a page out of his own book and locks down the EDBW arena, trapping everyone inside.

Deciding that the plan he had been working on with an unknown accomplice wasn't worth it, decided to open the airlocks and kill everyone.

The series then went into its five-part finale, structured like one large chain of PPVs and referred to as Season 7, culminating in Wresmania (that&#146;s not a typo). With the help of Persona 5&#146;s Joker, The Great Saiyaman, and some time travel, the mental hold over the roster was broken, and in a moment both blessed and cursed, a superpowered Bubsy did battle with a superpowered Monokuma. Season 7 also saw a series of matches to determine who the ultimate champion was, with tag teams fighting each other to determine who would face the singles champions. This culminated in a cross-gender match (courtesy of some clever CAW editing) to determine the champion of champions. Ultimately, in spite of getting his ass kicked for 20 minutes and the lyrics of his theme song, Strong Bad would prove that not even a lady can handle his style.</li></ul><br>A notable difference between <em>EDBW</em> and <em>W/VGCW</em> is that the former has a Trios Championship exclusive to its women's division; it's fairly simple, like the ones you see in Lucha Underground: Teams of three compete to be the best 3-Woman Team in the company. Formerly the show had a hardcore rules championship, not to be confused with the Hardcore Gamer Championship from <em>VGCW</em> (now simply called the VGCW Championship to avoid that confusion), complete with a "24/7 rule". Hence, any (male) <em>EDBW</em> wrestler could've challenged the champion to his / her belt at any moment <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3zqnx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3zqnx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3zqnx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Robin</a> took the belt, swapped genders, and brought it to the female division</span>.

However, people who don't get this assume that newer game equals a better game, so some people in the chat ask this. Everyone drinks and then explains why. <em>2K16</em> and subsequent future releases fixes a lot of the problems, but unfortunately still doesn't have story creator, meaning that it can't move on to that game either.

The other Phoenix Wrights were summoned by him with Sonic's Chaos Emerald in order to do so. Unfortunately, original!Phoenix Wright summoned a time traveling Phoenix Wright from an alternate VGCW universe (in which he is not a lawyer, and is incredibly ripped, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">does this sound familiar?</a>) who wants to kill every single copy of Solid Snake in existence, because he's tired of going to universes where everything changes except Snake and Mac leaving Phoenix in the past. When original!Wright logically refused, the other Phoenixs beat him up and threw him into a basement. Come End Game 6, and original!Wright returns to defeat his time-traveling duplicates with the help of Solid Snake and Gray Fox.
