Republic from within. He led a double life as the kindly Senator Sheev Palpatine from Naboo, masterminded his rise to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, the destruction of the Jedi Order, and the dissolution of the Galactic Republic after a millennium and the establishment of a new Galactic Sith Empire with himself as its tyrannical, fear-mongering ruler.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>His grand plan began with a proxy conflict on Naboo that he helped engineer, while also pulling the strings to develop a clone army for the Jedi in the conflict in the years to come. Over time, he would help initiate a seccesionist crisis that would require the Jedi to go to war alongside this clone army. After corrupting Anakin Skywalker and having him become his new apprentice, Darth Vader, he utilized a secret order that would purge most of the Jedi and force the remaining survivors to go into hiding where they could be hunted down.</p><p>While in power, he used his unchallenged position of authority to secretly uncover various secrets about the nature of the Force in search for immortality, while developing the Galactic Empire into an entity that could suppress any threats to his goals. When Luke Skywalker destroyed the first Death Star, he began to seek to corrupt Darth Vader's son and shift his focus back toward crushing any threats to his rule. Ultimately, he would underestimate Darth Vader's capacity of love for his son, leading to a fatal mistake that would cause his downfall and the destructiono of the Empire.</p><p>Even after his apparent demise at the hands of the Skywalker family, he was able to use his unnatural abilities with the Force to maintain his consciousness in a clone body &mdash; albeit a decaying one that had to be hooked up to machinery &mdash; where he spent several decades overseeing a new plan. He would seek revenge on those who had defeated him, create a new order where the act of rebellion was impossible, and achieve true immortality to rule it forever. He would once again be defeated, not just by his own granddaughter, who would reject him and accept the Skywalker family as her own, and by the last of the Skywalker bloodline, who he had manipulated even before his birth, but by a fleet of ships led both by soldiers and ordinary citizens who would ensure that his Empire would die with him.</p><hr><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parent</a>:<ul><li> He adopted and raised Darth Maul, if by "adopted and raised" you mean "kidnapped the poor kid, tormented him, and conditioned him to become a monster".</li><li> He also served as a father figure to Anakin Skywalker and shaped him into a monster as well; unlike with Maul, though, Palpatine was less obviously abusive to Anakin, opting instead to alienate him from his other loved ones, manipulate him or just straight-up lie to him to get what he wants from him. <em>Dark Lord of The Sith</em> has Darth Vader see a vision of his own fear that his seemingly immaculate birth was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the result of Palpatine manipulating the Force to impregnate Shmi, which means that he fears that Palpatine is his <em>literal</em> father as well</span>.</li><li> He is also this to his unnamed biological son, the father of Rey.

In canon, on the other hand, he never stops trying to have the Jedi hunted down and exterminated, creating the Inquisitorius and giving them to Vader specifically for the task.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalLateAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalLateAppearance">Adaptational Late Appearance</a>: Or rather, Adaptational Late Reappearance. In <em>Legends</em>, the resurrected Palpatine resurfaced around 10 ABY. In canon, he doesn't resurface until 35 ABY.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy">Adaptational Nice Guy</a>:<ul><li> A <strong>very</strong> downplayed example, but unlike in <em>Legends</em>, the relationship between Sidious and Vader is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend">deeply twisted affection</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">mutual animosity and distrust</a>. In <em>Legends</em>, Sidious took <em>every</em> opportunity to psychologically (and sometimes physically) torture Vader. In canon, Sidious is much more subdued. It even extends to Vader's suit; in <em>Legends</em>, Sidious deliberately made Vader's armor with painfully outdated technology (thus keeping his apprentice in constant pain) as a means of punishing Vader for his failure on Mustafar. In the Canon, there is no mention of this being the case, and Sidious even gives Vader permission to fully modify the suit in any way he sees fit. Another point is that Palpatine kept Vader's training completely stagnant in <em>Legends</em>, but in the Canon, he's often offering him advice and teaching him Sith philosophy. That being said, it's implied their canon relationship quietly degenerated into typical Sith treachery toward the end of their lives. Vader openly tried to recruit Luke into overthrowing Palpatine, something Palpatine was aware of and tried to do something similar with. Palpatine's attempt at this would cause Vader to lose any respect left for his master and kill them both.<ul><li> This is completely subverted when Vader fails him in recruiting Luke and begins digging too deeply into Padm&amp;eacute's death: Palpatine flat out tells Vader he's an easily replaced tool and brutally tortures and cripples him before leaving him for dead with his only hope of survival being to somehow piece himself together without the Force or die. This essentially puts him back in line with his <em>Legends</em> counterpart and reveals Palpatine's newfound affability is only skin deep.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Legends</em>, he was completely opposed to the idea of others ruling in his stead, never even pretending to broach the subject. In canon (as presented in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em>), he attempts to manipulate his granddaughter into becoming a new Sith Empress and even acting somewhat grandfatherly towards her. Granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">he never actually intended to let Rey be the one to rule</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp">Adaptational Wimp</a>: In <em>Legends</em>, by the time of the New Republic, Palpatine was essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, having become an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> at the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Darth Nihilus</a> without any of the latter's drawbacks. He possessed the power to tear time and space itself apart, devoured entire planets to sustain himself, distorted reality with his very existence, and eventually could not be contained by death conventionally. Here, he retains only a fraction of those same powers and is quite mortal, with his second death being his last. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">That said</a>, in canon, Force powers have been dramatically scaled down to more closely match the films, and his creation of a massive lightning storm in <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> is the most impressive feat of raw Force power seen in canon, showing he is still far and away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">the strongest Dark Side wielder seen</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdmiringTheAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdmiringTheAbomination">Admiring the Abomination</a>: When he sees the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">burnt form of Darth Vader</a>. Rather than his expected reaction of disappointment and anger, he instead sounds almost impressed that his apprentice managed to survive such sheer physical trauma.

By the end of the film, Vader has killed off the majority of his master's opponents with the remainder being cowed into silence and his hopes of saving Padm&amp;eacute's life are dashed when Vader crushes her throat in a fit of rage, leaving Sidious in a position where he never has to uphold his end of the bargain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>:<ul><li> In <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the Emperor was only identified by his title (or in the case of Darth Vader in private, "Master"). The name "Palpatine" originates from the non-canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> where it was given as the name of the first emperor, who was later assassinated. The first use of "Palpatine" in the canon to identify the character who becomes the Emperor is in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, where he was a senator.</li><li> His first name was a mystery for decades (and the subject of much speculations from fans) before being revealed as "Sheev" in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsTarkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsTarkin">Tarkin</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Ambiguously Human</a>: He looks more reptile than man in the Original Trilogy, which makes him stand from everyone else in the Empire, including Darth Vader. And while the Prequel Trilogy revealed that Palpatine used to look like a regular human before being disfigured in his duel against Mace Windu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid">Ian McDiarmid</a> plays the character as if he's wearing a human mask with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm">the scarred face being his real face all this time</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Ambiguous Situation</a>:<ul><li> His duel with Windu leaves it unclear how much advantage either of them had towards the end, before Anakin intruded; depending on who you ask, either Windu had Sidious against the ropes, or Sidious played along to end up in a vulnerable position in order to attract Anakin to his side. The choreography of the bout implies that both theories have a point of truth, as while Sidious clearly played up his battle wear after his disfigurement (he is certainly not "too weak" after all, and even does a visible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeTake">Eye Take</a> towards Anakin to see his reaction during his pleads), he also seemed to be trying his best against Windu before being disarmed and cornered in the window (as he clearly loses his cool along with his lightsaber even before Anakin entered the room). If it is the case, it shows how much of a master manipulator Palpatine is, because it illustrates a seamless usage of both slow planning and improvisation on the fly in order to get out of an unexpectedly risky situation: right afterward, once the only element that kept him cornered and threatened - Windu's lightsaber - goes literally out the window, Sidious capitalizes on the chance with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy">unlimited power</a>.</li><li> Related to the fight with Windu, it's uncertain whether getting his Force Lightning reflected back into his face is the true cause of his hideous appearance (which is the explanation he uses in-universe), or if that was his true face all along which he had masked with some kind of Force technique that became undone during the lightning. After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouUgly">physical decay from use of the Dark Side</a> is common among Sith, and Palpatine is the worst of them.

But at the same time there's a tremendous evil subconscious in operation. There's a moment in one scene of the new film where tears almost appear in his eye. These are crocodile tears, but for all those in the film, and perhaps watching the film itself, they'll see he is apparently moved&#151;and of course, he is. He can just do it. He can, as it were, turn it on. And I suppose for him, it's also a bit of a turn-on; the pure exercise of power is what he's all about. That's the only thing he's interested in and the only thing that can satisfy him, which makes him completely fascinating to play, because it is an evil soul. He is more evil than the Devil.

Instead, while Anakin/Vader is disposing of the Separatist leaders, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">now useless to him</a>, Palpatine announces that the Galactic Republic is now the Galactic Empire, making him Emperor with all powers on him forever and the governors still in control.</li><li> Palpatine tells Anakin that one of the secrets of the Dark Side is the ability to cheat death, something the Jedi can't/won't learn or teach. Once Anakin puts himself in a position where he may never receive forgiveness, he resigns himself to the ways of the Sith. It's at this point that Palpatine reveals that cheating death wasn't as well-known among the Sith as he'd previously implied. What's more, Qui-Gon discovered a way to transcend his mortal body and passed his knowledge onto Obi Wan and Yoda, who in turn passed it onto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luke and Leia</span>, revealing that the Sith never had exclusive knowledge over what Anakin was looking for.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>: Palpatine utterly relishes a good fight when he allows himself to cut loose. He clearly enjoyed fighting Maul and Savage; in fact, he could have killed them right off the bat, and chose to allow them to fight him simply for his own amusement. He also received a kick out of fighting Yoda. Notably, he's only like this when he's winning; at points when it looks like Yoda has the advantage, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">visibly panicked</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueIsHeroic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueIsHeroic">Blue Is Heroic</a>: When he's pretending to be the benevolent Supreme Chancellor, he often wears blue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>: His return from the dead in <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> features Palpatine in a rather sorry state.

He used everybody in the galaxy as his pawns, manipulated into tearing the galaxy and foundations of the Republic apart until he could take over completely, wipe out the Jedi, and have an unquestioningly loyal army at his command.</li><li> In the novel <em>Tarkin</em>, we learn that Palpatine would cleverly play his underlings against each other to prevent them from forming political alliances that could challenge his rule. This was a tactic used by Adolf Hitler in real life, one of George Lucas' inspirations for Palpatine.</li><li> He ordered Dooku to commission the creation of a clone army together with Sifo-Dyas, then kill the Jedi and conceal his involvement. Ten years later, the mercenary that served as the template for the clone troopers is tasked to assassinate a senator who would vote against a military act supporting the Republic building a standing army. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">supposedly very proficient</a> mercenary botches the job and has Obi-Wan on his trail, which leads to the Jedi discovering the clone army. At this point it looks like a gross oversight on Palpatine's part, but in fact it's a calculated move which ensures that the Jedi are the ones to conveniently discover the army, while they themselves remain convinced it's a coincidence. Since it was ordered by one of their own and they need it right at the moment (because Dooku baited the very same Jedi investigating the army and captured him while having built an army of his own), the proposition for using the army comes from the Jedi Order, painting them as warmongers and eliminating any suspicions of Palpatine's involvement, which would have been raised if he had suggested using the clones.</li><li> He knew better than to think that Dooku would remain unflinchingly loyal forever, and ordered him to kill Ventress as both a sign of his loyalty and to eliminate one of Dooku's most valuable assets.</li><li> The way he corrupted Anakin. First, he had Qui-Gon killed, which resulted in a freshly knighted Obi-Wan becoming Anakin's master. Obi-Wan was thoroughly inexperienced as a mentor and had to reinforce his authority by chiding his apprentice in public and lecturing him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">citing the Jedi Code</a>. All of this resulted in Anakin seeking a more understanding and less stern mentor, to which call Palpatine readily answered.

His dialogue is what you expect to find in a cheesy villain speech, but he never raises his voice beyond the low raspy one he already has, making him sound more menacing as opposed to just hammy.

If he doesn't, he retreats back into the shadows and does everything to slow his enemies down. This is best exemplified when he initially tries to flee from Master Yoda before Yoda blocks his exit and draws out his lightsaber, forcing Sidious to duel.

A secondary plan is his continuing search for a better apprentice.</li><li> In <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, his plan is revealed as an attempt to gain a new, untainted body to transfer his power and various minds into in order to regain control of the Galaxy and annihilate any planets that would stand against him. This time, he fails.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead">Evil Redhead</a>: Palpatine starts out with red hair in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, though a decade later it's gone white. However he still has ginger eyebrows in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, probably because Ian McDiarmid is a ginger in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. It's a fact made noticeable in an outtake for <em>Return of the Jedi</em> when he is being thrown into the pit McDiarmid's hood flops off revealing a cascade of ginger hair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a>:<ul><li> As shown in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E13Sacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E13Sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>", he's able to use the Master-apprentice link between Yoda and Dooku to attack Yoda's psyche, by way of an ancient ritual that required a single drop of Dooku's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">blood</a>.</li><li> The fire he used to try and capture Ezra and Ahsoka in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS4E11AWorldBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS4E11AWorldBetweenWorlds">A World Between Worlds</a>" is another good example of Palpatine's use of Sith Sorcery, and there's his general disdain for lightsaber combat over using the Force as a weapon.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep">Evil Sounds Deep</a>:<ul><li> He has a pretty deep voice in the later seasons of <em>The Clone Wars</em>, thanks to Tim Curry.</li><li> After he's disfigured during his duel with Mace Windu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, his voice becomes raspier and much deeper.</li><li> Clive Revill's original voice for him was this, instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid">Ian McDiarmid</a>'s iconic rasp.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsRaspy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsRaspy">Evil Sounds Raspy</a>: In the Prequel Trilogy and <em>The Clone Wars</em>, he speaks with a normal voice while under the guise of Chancellor Palpatine, but uses the rasp when he's acting as Darth Sidious. After the fight with Mace Windu leaves him with his distinctly disfigured face, he speaks with a raspy voice at all times &#151; so it becomes the iconic voice of Emperor Palpatine in the Original Trilogy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWearsBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWearsBlack">Evil Wears Black</a>: Palpatine frequently wears all black, indicating his evil nature.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>: Why yes, Luke, Palpatine <em>is</em> unarmed... but he does have access to the Force, as Luke very painfully discovers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror">Facial Horror</a>:<ul><li> After taking his own Force Lightning to the face, his face is white and heavily wrinkled, and his eyes are yellow and sunken. In <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, the brightness of his eyes relative to the rest of his face makes them look far wider than they are (or should be), making him look even freakier.</li><li> In <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, when Rey deflects his Force Lightning back at him, his face melts down and withers away in a particularly gruesome fashion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseProphet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseProphet">False Prophet</a>: Palpatine lies about being able to cheat death so he can persuade Anakin into becoming his apprentice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>:<ul><li> Luke is quick to surmise that Palpatine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">overconfidence</a> is what will do him in. True to form, he died the very same day.</li><li> Also his inability to understand good. While he knows how to use other people's flaws and strengths, deep down, he does not get good, being himself pure evil.</li><li> It is subtle, but Sidious is unable to learn from his mistakes. His intelligence, power, and success, plus his psychopathic traits, make him blind to avoid committing the same mistakes again, and actually understanding some things he really should know better. In <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, he underestimated Padm&amp;eacute, the Jedi, and the natives of Naboo. As a result, he lost Naboo and his first apprentice. While his long term plans were undamaged, he had still suffered some shortcomings, and enough lessons to learn from it. But he keeps underestimating his opponents (Yoda catches him off guard and almost killed him, Obi-Wan escapes his trap; Mon Mothma and Bail Organa), which ends up with a rebellion engulfing the Galaxy. When having to deal with the rebellion, his arrogance gets the better of him, and he loses everything. But not only that, but his inability to truly understand love is what destroys him. He ignores very strong signals from Vader and from Luke; not only that Vader is way too obsessed with catching his son, but that Luke shows he is not like Anakin. The fact he could not sense Luke on the ship, and Vader could, should have worried him more. And when he is frying Luke, Vader is with him, showing he truly does not know who Vader is deep down. This, combined with his idea Vader is completely under his thumb, dooms him once and for all.</li><li> While normally very intelligent and cunning, he has a habit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">losing himself in his sadism when going all out</a>, which blinds him to potential dangers around him. This is apparently one of the big weaknesses of the Dark Side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">due to having to let one's emotions go wild in order to properly use it</a>.</li><li> In a broader context, his apathy and cruelty while running the Empire. He's shown to be a <em>very</em> proficient leader during the Clone Wars, capable of expertly manipulating public opinion and managing two sides of the conflict. He's much more hands off with the Empire, only stepping in to control/provoke power struggles between his subordinates and request the odd super project or atrocity. As a result the Empire has a major systemic issue with incompetence and an increasingly dissatisfied populace. If he stepped in to make sure things went smoothly, there would be much less of a rebellion to fight and he might be able to convince Luke to actually join him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>: Palpatine's Empire was humanocentrist and very xenophobic and prejudiced towards non-Human beings. As such, very few of the higher ups in the Empire were non-Human, with Thrawn and Xixor being notable exceptions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> with Palpatine himself however. As shown by the fact that he mentored Darth Maul, a Dathomirian Zabrak, he harbored no xenophobia towards non-Humans. He just used it as a useful tool to have a base of support among Humans. He did however show disdain towards common people without Force sensitivity. While it was never enough for him to openly discriminate, he did believe that non-Force sensitives were inherently inferior to Force sensitives, though this could simply be part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> mentality. True to real life, as psychopaths are said to be incapable of true bigotry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Faux Affably Evil</a>: In the waning days of the Republic, he has a tendency to be charming and friendly in spite of his intentions to screw everyone over. As the Emperor, he doesn't particularly bother to hide the fact that he's a bastard, but on occasion is genuinely polite to his subjects, provided that they don't fail him, and occasionally gives off a mockingly concerned tone of voice. He also employs a veneer as a kindly old grandfather-like figure when interacting with those younger whom he wants to manipulate, such as Ezra, Gallius Rax or his actual granddaughter, Rey.<div class="indent"><em>"Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite </em>operational<em> when your friends arrive."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>: He's the final villain that Luke encounters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>.

Upon arriving at the civil war-torn Mandalore, Sidious chokes two Mandalorian super commandos with a gesture of his left hand. He doesn't keep it up, like most characters do, he just <em>waves</em> his fingers <em>once</em>, and it continues even after he passes them by. Later, he pinned two others against a wall without even seeing them before even entering the same room at them. Sidious is also powerful enough to choke and lift Dooku on Serenno in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E10TheLostOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E10TheLostOne">The Lost One</a>", while he himself is on Coruscant &#151; a difference of <em>hundreds of light-years</em>.</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsDarthVader2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsDarthVader2020">Star Wars: Darth Vader (2020)</a></em>, Sidious inflicts this on Vader (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> himself) after his failure to convert Luke to the Dark Side on Bespin and also for defying his orders by investigating Padm&eacute;'s death.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith">A Form You Are Comfortable With</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In <em>Rebels</em></span>, his hologram appears as his younger, unscarred self from before his battle with Mace in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, and his personality matches.

He got voted into absolute power after masterminding a civil war that destroyed a millennium of peace (in which he was secretly the leader of both sides), resulting in him receiving popular support for his authoritarian reforms. By the time he declared himself Emperor, he already had absolute control of the Republic ... or, as he declared it, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">the first!

Specifically it required that he become a high ranking senator on Naboo and a Dark Lord of the Sith, use his Sith identity to set up a proxy conflict on Naboo to ensure that he would become the Supreme Chancellor when his predecessor seemed too weak to take action, recruit a fallen Jedi diplomat to spearhead the creation of the Clone Army and create an override system to ensure that they would kill the Jedi, cause enough political unrest behind the scenes to lead to the creation of the Separatist movement and have that fallen Jedi become its public face, gain emergency powers in time to mobilize the Clone Army against the Separatists, have the Separatists start the 22-year construction process on a planet-destroying Death Star superweapon, carry out a war while maintaining the fa&ccedil;ade of being a kindly old man, justify the deaths of thousands of Jedi by what appeared to be an attempt to overthrow the Republic, bump off all of the above collaborators so they wouldn't spill any information, and declare that the Republic needed to become an Empire to be more efficient with him as the leader, and finally dissolve the Imperial Senate upon the completion of the Death Star seized from the Separatists so he could have absolute power with no bureaucracy and instantly blow up anyone's planet who disagrees with him.

While he's often behind everything that "transpires", occasionally things go wrong without his help. In these cases he usually lays back and waits for an opportunity to use these events to further his own agenda, especially in the Original Trilogy, where he doesn't have much of a role compared to Darth Vader and Tarkin.<ul><li> Several episodes of <em>The Clone Wars</em> deal with events and villains who operate outside of his plans, though they're all fundamentally thriving in a conflict he created and manipulated. A notable example is featured during the Umbara arc, where he entrusted Krell with taking over the leadership of the 501<sup>st</sup> from Anakin because he recognized that the Besalisk Jedi had fallen and was curious to see what he'd do. Another example is the Nightsisters and Brothers arc since aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingInstigatorOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingInstigatorOfDoom">accidentally setting off the crisis</a> of Darth Maul's return, he remains completely uninvolved in the events right up until Maul becomes an actual threat to his plans.</li><li> He's barely present in the first three seasons of <em>Rebels</em>, aside from a HoloNet broadcast and a holographic conversation with Vader (and we don't even get to see his hologram), he's indirectly responsible for the Empire's actions and all the misery they've brought to the protagonists. By Season 2, he knows who they are and ordered Vader to deal with them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Season 4 spices things up by ending the series with a confrontation between him and Ezra, although Ezra later challenges and defeats Thrawn after the climax.</span></li><li> He serves as this for most of the Original Trilogy.

Palpatine operated on something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> philosophy, and therefore had contingency plans for the Empire to wreak havoc on everybody in the event that he died.<ul><li> He seems to have become this retroactively for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, based on info from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AftermathEmpiresEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AftermathEmpiresEnd">Empire's End</a></em>. His contingency plan involved sending groups of handpicked Imperials into the Unknown Regions and possibly away from the galaxy, where they will establish a new empire elsewhere. This is what happened at the end of <em>Empire's End</em>, when Rae Sloane and Brendol Hux found Palpatine's personal Super Star Destroyer, the <em>Eclipse</em>, stationed in the Unknown Regions, and from there they proceed to found the First Order, the main antagonistic faction in <em>The Force Awakens</em>.</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, he reveals to Kylo Ren that he had created Snoke.

He would claim that he would operate legally but privately he openly told his family that as soon as he took power he intended to set up a National Court that would try and execute political criminals. The Nazi movement also attracted and depended on a lot of confused youth and university students from universities who couldn't find work and felt alienated from society (similar to Anakin). Hitler was also inspired by Roman strongmen like Sulla Felix, openly telling everyone that the proscriptions in Ancient Rome would serve as a model for what they would do to their enemies. As such Lucas, naturally combined Hitler and Roman oligarchs for his ultimate villain.</li><li> One of Palpatine's favorite tactics is (especially in <em>The Clone Wars</em>) is to pretend to be a kindly moderate voice of reason forced into taking extreme measures by both circumstances and political realities. In reality, he's usually the one giving extreme opinions that favor his agenda a voice while silencing moderates by subtly playing favorites on who has the floor.

But there are multiple examples: one, he allows Vader to adjust his suit as he wishes; two, he has more faith in Vader than in the Inquisitors, Cylo's potential replacements for Vader and any of his other apprentices; three, he could easily replace the crippled Vader with any of the Inquisitors but he choose to keep Vader (who is still very powerful despite his injuries) as his apprentice instead; and last, he seems to care about Vader (as much as a Sith Lord could) as when he senses that Darth Vader is in danger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, he immediately departs for Mustafar and thus saves his life (and again, he could have left Vader to die on Mustafar but choose not to).

However, he views the face-concealing Darth Sidious to be his real face and the open and fair-looking Palpatine to be his mask.

Although this is subverted once Vader becomes too belligerent for Palpatine's taste and the Dark Side even loses its sway on him.

His lightsaber skills are undoubtedly among the very top of his era, as he is capable of dueling multiple Jedi or Sith opponents as if it were nothing, holds his own pretty well against Mace Windu (and that's assuming he didn't throw the swordfight to corrupt Anakin), and defends successfully against all of Yoda's attacks whenever they cross blades in their duel. However, he still performs better at sheer Force powers than at sword combat, so much that, upon unexpectedly losing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock">Blade Lock</a> to Yoda, Sidious ultimately decides to keep him at long range with Force attacks rather than risking himself against the Jedi master's lightsaber.

In <em>The Clone Wars</em>, he uses two lightsabers in his fight against Darth Maul and Savage Opress, and his style there is incredibly elaborate and aggressive at the same time, mixing insane lightsaber maneuvers with overpowering Force attacks. He even scratches up the floor with his sabers a few times in the melee. In his fight with the Jedi Masters sent to arrest him in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, he executes a brutal attack from surprise that kills half of them before they even know what's happening, and then proceeds to duel Windu in a pretty technical style before resorting again to lightning when disarmed.

This proves to be his undoing in the long run, as the Dark Side clouds Palpatine's ability to think and foresee future events, best seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> where he doesn't sense Vader's inner conflict until it's too late.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomTheDarkLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomTheDarkLord">Tom the Dark Lord</a>: The most powerful and evil person in the galaxy, and his first name is <em>Sheev</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>:<ul><li> Not only did he try to kill Luke in front of his father, who had specifically made it known that he wanted to keep his son alive even though it would be easier to kill him, but he also effectively told Darth Vader that he was ultimately expendable.

While Vader and Sidious agreed beforehand to kill Luke if he refused to join them, Vader has been slowly turning away from the Dark Side due to the love for his recently discovered son and Palpatine is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">too deluded to see it</a> and as a result, Vader fully rejects the Dark Side and throws Sidious to his death.</li><li> After rejuvenating himself in <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, Palpatine immediately uses the Force to throw Ben Solo into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a> and unleashes a storm of Force Lightning upon Lando's massive fleet.

When Rey gets up to face her grandfather, Palpatine decides to use Force Lightning to kill her rather than throwing her into the pit along with Ben or use any other means (such as a Force Choke or stealing all of her lifeforce). This backfires spectacularly as Rey is able to deflect back the Force Lightning with two lightsabers and Palpatine, unable to stop the feedback loop, ends up disintegrating into ashes. And because he opted for a less destructive Force Lightning storm, Lando's fleet is able to recover and destroy the remaining Star Destroyers on Exegol.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>:<ul><li> Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> and retcons, Palpatine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a> gaming skills in the Original Trilogy are way off over 20 years after he takes over the Republic. Despite his use of the same deceptive tactics and serendipity that led to the destruction of the Jedi and the creation of the Empire in the first trilogy, Palpatine centers only on protection of the Death Star, ignoring the historical tendency for Sith and Jedi to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">change allegiances like they change their socks</a> and not always to your advantage. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18q096');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18q096" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18q096');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">During the events of the Original Trilogy this tendency to switch sides did not exist.

An example is when Tyranus shows himself to be 'clumsy', Sidious Force-choked him as a reminder for failure. This contrasts when Vader fails with the first Death Star, Sidious just chews him verbally (albeit it is still very condescending from the Emperor) and not physically (which he is clearly capable of).</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsDarthVader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsDarthVader">Darth Vader comic book series</a>, Sidious describes Vader as his one and only worthy apprentice, calling Vader a superior candidate for this position. And openly calling Darth Maul a loss and Darth Tyranus a proton torpedo, a simple tool which had served a purpose and is now gone (also implying that Tyranus is only a placeholder for the position to leave it to his one and true apprentice), is a good step in that direction. And thus, he seems to have the most faith in Vader than in any of his other apprentices, proven by the fact that Vader is still at Sidious' side for two decades.</li><li> Another point: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarthVaderDarkLordOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarthVaderDarkLordOfTheSith">Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith</a></em>, he seems to genuinely want to rule the Empire with Vader at his side as he refers the Galactic Empire as "their Empire". And he advises and teaches him about Sith philosophy.</li><li> Palpatine never refers to Dooku or Maul as "his friend" like he does with Vader. True, he does call the Grand Inquisitor once as "my friend", but Vader is still the Emperor's right hand and thus has his favor.</li><li> Sidious seems to tolerate Vader's bluntness towards him: like when he makes Sidious agree on his ultimatum on the Imperial Officer Corps and also when Vader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">retorts</a> Sidious' arguments about Cylo's replacements' failure.</li><li> Any of the above is thrown out the window when Sidious can have a more powerful apprentice, which only comes when Luke shows up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy">Villainous Legacy</a>: The First Order in the Sequel Trilogy is obsessed with reinstating the Empire he forged.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue">Villainous Rescue</a>: He saves Darth Vader on Mustafar once he's realized that his life is in danger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect">Villain Respect</a>:<ul><li> He displayed a grudging respect in private to Padm&amp;eacute for her impassioned speech that turned the Senate against his wishes in &#147;Pursuit of Peace&#148;, musing that for all his power he was still accumulating, it faltered against Padm&amp;eacute's one voice.</li><li> In the loosest and cruelest sense considering Palpatine's narcissism, Palpatine is astonished by Imperial Officer Baylo's open rage and defiance towards him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">as well as the lengths he would go to kill him and Vader</a>.

His experiments and skills even went so far as to let him be able to tap into the veil of the Force, The World Between Words, which not even the heroes could do without the Force allowing them to. Granted he could only access it to a limited extent but that still meant he had partial access to a realm that allows people to traverse and view all of time and space. He could also Force Choke people from light years away and even manipulate the perceptions of the greatest Jedi Master, Yoda.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Subverted with Darth Maul. It was Maul's <em>empire</em> which convinced Palpatine that something serious needed to be done, not his former apprentice by himself. While he does allow Maul to fight him for the sport of it, during their duel, he visibly gets more serious when facing off with his well-trained vengeful apprentice alone.</li><li> In <em>The Clone Wars</em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E13Sacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E13Sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>", Palpatine fails to mentally break Yoda and realizes that the old Jedi Master is this to him. In <em>Revenge of The Sith</em> Palpatine consistently refers to the old Jedi as "Master Yoda," showing a respect for his capability with the Force, and Yoda even has to <em>stop Palpatine from fleeing a fight with him</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>, indeed.</li><li> He considered Mother Talzin, who was once his prospective right hand, someone he and his generals needed to deal with personally.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Sidious was perfectly fine with performing potentially lethal experiments on <em>infants</em> during the Clone Wars.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>:<ul><li> Using the Trade Federation to attack his own planet, gaining sympathy and beginning his ascent to power is more or less this trope on a planetary scale.</li><li> Palpatine pulls this off in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Anakin</a> side with him against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Mace Windu</a>. He's just a tired old man viciously attacked by the ruthless Jedi despite being willing to surrender. He's barely alive, so surely Anakin wouldn't allow a murder to occur? And not only has Anakin been spending a great deal of time alone with Palpatine and beginning to be swayed by his words, but he has good reason to resent the Jedi after they grant him only token representation on the Council and force him into becoming their spy, and sees Mace as an arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Rabid Cop</a> who's subverting the laws of the Republic. (He doesn't actually want to kill Mace and his horror at Mace's death is palpable.) Palpatine is a rare example of this trope in that he's both a gazelle and a lion. One moment he's begging for mercy; the next, he's gleefully electrocuting Mace while screaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">"POWER!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">UNLIMITED</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">POWER!"</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>: He took his savvyness a bit too far when he ordered Dooku to eliminate Ventress on the grounds of her becoming too powerful to let her remain the Count's apprentice. Up to that point, Dooku had never shown any desire to betray Sidious, but once he had Savage as a replacement, he immediately stated his plans to overthrow him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">It all works out in Sidious' favor in the end</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>:<ul><li> Sidious's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>. At the start of the film he wants the Trade Federation to hold Queen Amidala prisoner; when she escapes, he sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to prevent her from reaching Coruscant. But Amidala does reach Coruscant, and within a couple hours she actually <em>helps</em> Sidious in becoming Chancellor Palpatine.</li><li> Since he controls both sides of the Clone Wars, he can take over the galaxy and destroy the Jedi Order regardless of which side actually wins, though it's pretty clear that a Separatist victory would be Plan B. His various gambits around his apprentices most truly represent this trope, however &#151; by pitting his current apprentice against the potential replacement, he wins no matter the outcome. Dooku finds this out the hard way. Vader, on the other hand, takes exception to the idea.</li><li> During the Clone Wars, when Fives started to catch on to the plan to brainwash the clone troopers into slaughtering Jedi, Palpatine does some quick thinking to make it look like the mind control chips in the clone troopers are there for their own good: after a failed attempt to get Fives killed before he could get off Kamino with his story, Palpatine then arranges to speak with the clone trooper one on one &#151; then makes it look like Fives tried to assassinate him in a fit of rage, seemingly proving the Kaminoans' claim the chips are aggression-suppressants rather than mind control tech, while convincing everyone else to write Fives off as insane due to having his <em>own</em> chip removed.</li><li> The situation Palpatine was in after Anakin warned the Jedi Order that he was the Sith Lord who had assumed the reins of the government is advantageous to him because by that point the Jedi Order were too deep to get out unscathed. If they had publicly accused him, they wouldn't be able to directly prove wrongdoing without citing their own doctrine (which results in it being hearsay) and if they had waited until they could get tangible evidence against him then they wouldn't prevent the vote that would allow him to assume complete emergency power. That leaves the solution that was enacted (use of lethal force to eliminate the Sith threat) and because the Order took action on their own accord, they now look like traitors who attempted an assassination on the Supreme Chancellor. Any outcome from this situation would allow Palpatine to defame the Jedi and enact Order 66.</li><li> There are two Skywalkers, one's already his apprentice but he's more machine than man now and the other is young, idealistic and a potential threat. So he tries to tempt Luke to the dark side with a duel with his father, or by killing <em>him</em>. If Luke wins, he either gets an upgraded apprentice or becomes Vader's apprentice, if not, he's rid of a potential threat and Darth Vader's loyalty no longer has another possible recipient. It didn't work however, as Luke wouldn't turn to the Dark Side. He then tries to kill Luke but that doesn't work either because Vader is still capable of throwing the Emperor off a balcony.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a>: <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

For example, he hadn't intended for Padm&eacute; to arrive on Coruscant, but worked it into his plan instead, which turned out better than the original one.<ul><li> Palpatine is this trope so much that people now assume <em>every single aspect of the Canon</em> is his doing, and all went as planned (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">except dying</a>). They forget that most of <em>The Phantom Menace</em> has him quickly changing his game plan, either because he underestimated the heroes or because X-factors kept popping up. He ends up getting what he wanted, but <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says there were enough setbacks that he had to wait a decade to get the ball rolling on the next big step in his plan, including the loss of an apprentice. That he was able to take one of those X-factors and befriend him early so he could turn him into a replacement apprentice is testament to his speed-chess abilities.</li><li> It's eventually revealed that Palpatine did anticipate and plan for Maul's death. However, the Jedi being sent to deal with the Trade Federation, as well as Amidala's arrival on Coruscant, weren't part of his plans according to supplementary material (Valorum consulted the Jedi without informing the Senate first, and he did expect Maul to succeed in retrieving Amidala). In fact, his original plan was that he and his agents would create turmoil, draw the occupation out for months or even years, and cause enough pressure to cow the Senate into electing him. Almost everything after Padm&eacute; turned up on Coruscant was improvisation and moving up the timetable considerably for example, by being elected a decade <em>before</em> the Clone Wars broke out, he was in danger of losing his position as Chancellor by the time of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> as his legal term had technically expired, and he had to use his emergency powers to extend it.</li><li> In <em>The Rise Of Skywalker</em>, he's dead set on having his granddaughter Rey kill him so she can inherit the legacy of the Sith by him taking over her body until he discovers that she's part of a Force Dyad with Ben Solo. Once he rejuvenates himself using their link, he decides to reclaim his title as the true Galactic Emperor instead.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>: It's heavily implied in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> that Palpatine was even more horrific in how he punishes those who fail their task than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, Darth Vader. And no one, not even the <em>Galactic Empire</em> itself, is safe from his wrath.<div class="indent"><strong>Darth Vader:</strong> I hope so, Commander, for your sake.
