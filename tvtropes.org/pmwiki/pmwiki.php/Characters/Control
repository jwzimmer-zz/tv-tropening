Jesse finds herself within the walls of the Federal Bureau of Control while seeking answers regarding her younger brother, Dylan's, disappearance. However, unseen circumstances have forced her to become the Bureau's new Director. With the aid of Polaris and Bureau employees, Jesse must defeat the Hiss and remove the lockdown off of the Bureau's Oldest House.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: As being the female protagonist, Jesse beats back an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> throughout the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a>: The Service Weapon she picks up functions like a pistol in its default mode, but it's made out of shifting, slightly vibrating cubes and other shapes that can float apart and come back together into a new shape. There's no iron sights, for example, just smaller cubes that pop up when she aims it. It's heavily implied it's made of the same inscrutible materials as the Oldest House itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>: Jesse is quite fond of Emily, it would seem. During her expedition into the Foundation, every new sight is met by Jesse with wistful thoughts of Emily, how Jesse wishes she were here, how smart she is, how much she would love this, etc. It's to the point where it's implied that that desire to see Emily actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">called her to the Foundation</a>!</em> (Polaris playing wing-entity, perhaps?) Notably, Emily is the only major Bureau employee whose first name Jesse calls her by, and Emily even returns the favor! Remedy even threw more fuel on the fire during an AMA, saying that Jesse has "a lot of love for Emily", and the two share a "very special bond".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a>: Particularly after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ashtray Maze sequence, where you have to blast your way through the Hiss while listening to an Old Gods of Asgard song</span>. She shares the general opinion of players on that:<div class="indent"><strong>Jesse:</strong> That was awesome.</div><ul><li> She's also, despite the tension of the situation and her uncertainty about who to trust, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">delighted</a> to be in the Bureau of Control and says she never wants to leave.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>: While it's implied this was the case with all Directors, Jesse is in a league all her own and by far the most powerful member of the Bureau after becoming its Director.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">Badass Adorable</a>: She may look quite beautiful and has a dorky side out of missions, but this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> and supernatural-powered woman officially became the Director of the FBC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Barrier Maiden</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the end of the game, she's the only source of Hedron resonance, which means that she is the only thing keeping the surviving FBC staff from being corrupted by the Hiss.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterInstinct">Big Sister Instinct</a>: Jesse is looking for her younger brother, Dylan, who was taken by the Bureau in the past.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: A lot of her dialogue consists of snarking at the events occurring around her. Particularly, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonSmartass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonSmartass">thoughts</a> are the biggest source of her snark.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu">Did You Just Flip Off Cthulhu?</a>: She has no problem calling out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The Board</a> when they're getting in the way of her mission, such as when they yell at her for taking both powers in "The Foundation":<div class="indent"><strong>The Board:</strong> Do not be ignorant/thick. You are being reckless/disobedient. <br><strong>Jesse:</strong> I don't like you deciding what I can-slash-can't have.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Dishing Out Dirt</a>:<ul><li> The Shield Barrage and Shield Rush upgrades to her Shield ability let her throw the rocky debris that makes up her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitingParticleShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitingParticleShield">Orbiting Particle Shield</a> at nearby enemies, or smash into them at high speed like the Vanguard class from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> onwards, respectively.</li><li> During the Foundation DLC, she gains the ability to create platforms, walls and spikes out of specific types of regenerating rock growing out of the walls and floors and the ability to destroy similar rock formations by shooting at them with her Service Weapon. Both abilities can be used in combat, either by shooting out the floor underneath enemies or flash-growing spiky crystal from the floor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> most enemies caught in the area of effect.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontCallMeSir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontCallMeSir">Don't Call Me "Sir"</a>: Being generally uncomfortable with her unsolicited promotion to Director, Jesse puts quite a bit of effort into getting the FBC personnel to stop going formal on her. Emily is the only one who actually switches to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> communication, with the others either settling for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a> or ignoring the request altogether.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencedProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencedProtagonist">Experienced Protagonist</a>: She may be new to the FBC but she's no stranger to weirdass paranormal events, having been on the run from them ever since her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a> was torn apart by extra-dimensional forces as a kid. She's actually <em>delighted</em> to finally get confirmation that all her adventures are real when she finally gets into the FBC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>: She is very attractive and her default outfit is modest but, her PS4-exclusive Astral Dive suit is noticeably form-fitting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticallyIndifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticallyIndifferent">Fantastically Indifferent</a>: She grows into this by the end of the game like the rest of the Bureau have, but it's averted at the start. Jesse, who starts the game with some psychic power exposure, is still constantly surprised by all the weird shit that happens in the Oldest House. She lampshades this after she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills Mold-1</span>:<div class="indent"> "I need to stop being surprised by all the weird shit in this place."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>: She can't take much damage even with her health fully upgraded, but she's significantly faster than almost all enemies she faces, allowing her to outmaneuver them with her superior agility, especially once she's learned how to levitate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead">Fiery Redhead</a>: Downplayed. Jesse is definitely confident and driven, but she isn't exactly a hothead. In fact, she's insecure and has low self-confidence throughout most of the game. She also has noticeably red hair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>: Jesse's use of the control points to fast travel. Jesse asks Emily if anyone has done this before and Emily comments no one has ever done it. She concludes it is unique to Jesse, and even she might only be able to do it thanks to Polaris.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>: Jesse's paranatural abilities and weaponry can inflict horrendous damage in no time, but without her debris shield (which isn't all that strong and also prevents her from using most of her attacks) she's about as durable as an unarmored human can be expected to be when faced with hordes of enemies wielding firearms and supernatural abilities like her own. Her main defense consists of always being on the move to avoid getting hit in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesSmallTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesSmallTalk">Hates Small Talk</a>: During the "Talk to the Plants" side mission, Jesse admits small talk was never her strong suit, but later admits she liked conversing and confiding with said plants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When she thinks that the destruction of the Hedron killed Polaris, she has one of these... right before the Hiss starts overtaking her.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">Heroic Self-Deprecation</a>: Jesse repeatedly states that she doesn't feel like she's fit to be the new Director, essentially having the role thrust upon her by the board once she picks up the Service Weapon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InkSuitActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InkSuitActor">Ink-Suit Actor</a>: She is modeled after her voice actress who is Sally Spectra in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful">The Bold and the Beautiful</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist">Internal Reformist</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After becoming Director, she makes it clear she has no intention to be like her predecessors, and seeks to reform and change the Bureau into something more moral.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice">Lantern Jaw of Justice</a>: A rare female example, she has a prominent squared jawline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: The Hebrew masculine name "Jesse" means "gift". However, if one uses her name as a diminutive of "Jessica", then it could mean "to behold". Jesse herself has powerful psychic abilities and the story involves her uncovering the secrets and lore surrounding the Bureau. If can also specifically mean 'Gift From God', which Jesse received from Polaris.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumBlending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumBlending">Medium Blending</a>: Courtney Hope appears in live-action footage when the Hiss almost overtakes Jesse at the start of the game, before being driven out by Polaris. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This happens again when Hedron dies, and Jesse feels like she's lost control.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Mind over Matter</a>: Most of the powers granted to her by O.o.Ps revolve around manipulating the environment with her mind, such as picking up objects and throwing them. Even her innate melee attack is actually a short-ranged telekinetic blast strong enough to shatter solid concrete walls in a single hit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter">Nice to the Waiter</a>: Since she's been a janitor herself she's immediately inclined to think of Ahti as friendly and likes Arish more upon hearing about his respect for the maintenance staff. While she's uncertain about some of the higher ranking people she works with over the course of the game, she's concerned about the various grunts she finds in peril.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareOfNormality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareOfNormality">Nightmare of Normality</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The climax of the game features her being infected by the Hiss in the aftermath of Hedron's destruction, resulting in Jesse finding herself trapped in a nightmarish illusion where she never became the superpowered director of the Federal Bureau of Control, but instead lives out her days as an office temp at the FBC. However, with a little encouragement from Ahti, Jesse gradually begins to notice that something's wrong; after figuring out what's going on, she finally breaks free by rediscovering the power of Polaris within her, backdooring into the Oceanview Motel thanks to Dr Darling, and unleashing her renewed powers on the Hiss.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>: Jesse is likely the most powerful psychic the Bureau has ever seen with only Dylan matching her and more than capable of mowing down legions of Hiss by herself. Keep in mind the Bureau, an organization specifically trained for combating the supernatural, are near powerless against the Hiss, even with devices to shield them from the Hiss's corrupting power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: Aside from the Service Weapon and the Hotline, every Object of Power Jesse binds herself with gives her some kind of psychic ability, not to mention the innate power of resisting the Hiss that Polaris gives her. She also may have had some low-grade telekinesis thanks to Polaris since her default melee strike is a short-range blast and she opens up treasure boxes by gesturing at them. Not as much as the O.o.P.s gave her, of course.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantHero">Reluctant Hero</a>: Initially, Jesse doesn't feel comfortable becoming the new Director.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a>: A subtle, but quite impressive instance.

The Board decides to appoint her, but even this is a choice on her behalf: as the Board says, she has to "choose to be chosen." Willingly stepping into the FBC and the weird world it represents (rather than being unwillingly stuck in it like Dylan) seems to be one of the deciding factors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero">Working-Class Hero</a>: Has been working whatever menial jobs she could find in the 17 years she's been searching for the FBC, so suddenly being made Director is an uncomfortable leap for her.

He literally tells the staff physician inspecting him that his feats are "the product of divine collaboration", and that the Board has "awoken in him a power beyond his understanding that will only continue to grow".

The FBC took an interest in his business and investigated him. He was determined to be a low level threat, but the Bureau, never one to take risks, got his psychiatry license revoked and confiscated his research on the power of Cauldron Lake. Hartman, however, wasn&#146;t deterred, and managed to determine that the Dark Place could be escaped. He threw himself into the lake, but he didn&#146;t exactly find what he was looking for.</p><p>Hartman became a particularly powerful Taken, and rambled around Bright Falls for a little while before being recaptured by the FBC. All was well for a time, as he was securely locked up in the Investigations Sector... until the Bureau brought in Alice Wake for an interview. Sensing her presence, Hartman broke free, necessitating the sealing of the sector behind a Firebreak.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">And then the Hiss showed up.</a></p><p>The Hiss resonance and the power of the Dark Presence mingled inside Hartman&#146;s being, fighting for control, turning him into... something new.

Taken usually had a "darkness shield" around themselves that made them resistant to damage unless they were in the light, but Hartman's seems even stronger than normal, possibly because it's mixed with the shields Hiss can create.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>: The combination of the Hiss and the Dark Presence is a particularly toxic one, as Hartman can attest. He has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepilyLongArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepilyLongArms">extremely long arms and legs</a> that are disproportionate to his already gigantic physiology, and his ribs poke out of his hunched back. Langston, once he sees him, likens the sight to something out of a 1980s horror movie, and is thoroughly disgusted beyond anything else he has encountered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: In a last ditch effort to gain the reality-warping power of the Darkness, he ends up diving into Cauldron Lake itself. He finds out the hard way that although he gained a hefty power boost from the experience, enough to slaughter his way through the Investigations Sector and require it to be sealed off to stop his rampage, losing all but the barest vestiges of himself was the price he had to pay for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepilyLongArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepilyLongArms">Creepily Long Arms</a>: And legs. The humanoid torso at the center of the monster is roughly normal-sized (for a being of his height) but everything else is way too long, giving him an uncannily elongated appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossMeltingAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossMeltingAura">Cross-Melting Aura</a>: If you try to bring a portable light into his boss fight arenas, the light will break instantly. Only very bright floodlights from the House's installations will work on it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a>: In his final audio log, Hartman reveals that considers the Bureau and Alan to be foolish for not wanting to exploit the powers of the Dark Presence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy">Evil Is Not a Toy</a>: The files and audio logs you find in the DLC reveal that though Hartman miraculously evaded being eaten by the darkness after being locked in a room with it by Alan Wake, he couldn't escape the long arm of the paranatural-law. The FBC seized all his research and rescinded his licence and took his lodge away for good measure, since he was just one man meddling with forces even <em>they</em> could barely comprehend. Then he decided to hop in the cursed lake, positive he was more "mentally prepared" than others who went there and whoops, he's a Taken now.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitVillainStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitVillainStageLeft">Exit Villain Stage Left</a>: For most of the DLC you can't really fight Hartman, just drive him away by activating all the lights in an area. It takes depriving him of any hiding places in the sector to secure the chance to take him down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>: From a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> to an avatar of two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Cosmic Horrors</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">merging into an even bigger Cosmic Horror</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a>: An unusual example. The Dark Presence's power inside him merged with the Hiss's resonance when it tried to possess him. So while the Dark Presence and Hiss as a whole haven't merged, whatever bit of them is inside Hartman <em>has</em> combined. Alan implies it's possible what was <em>left</em> of Hartman himself may also have been caught up in the merger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid">Horned Humanoid</a>: A really ugly variation, as the "horns" he's got are really his elongated ribs jutting out of his back. His hunched posture and framing make them look like antlers, but coming from the wrong place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>: He was already turned into a powerful Taken like Nightingale, Jagger and Mr. Scratch before exposure to the Hiss made him something <em>much</em> worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HybridMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HybridMonster">Hybrid Monster</a>: An extremely powerful Hiss-Taken hybrid. He's got the pale grey skin and weird body mutations of a Hiss victim, and the darkness shield of a Taken, but both are amped up due to the two resonating within him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HybridPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HybridPower">Hybrid Power</a>: Being a Hiss-Taken hybrid makes him <em>far</em> stronger than either. He's so large and powerful, he makes even the largest Taken or Hiss minuscule in comparison. While a flashlight is enough to weaken even stronger Taken, it takes <em>floodlights</em> to do the same to him and he possesses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossMeltingAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossMeltingAura">Cross-Melting Aura</a> that causes any smaller light sources to explode when brought into proximity to him. Alan even outright says any ordinary person would be torn to shreds by him and it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Jesse</a> to stand a chance against him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: Alan keeps addressing him as "The-Thing-That-Had-Been-Hartman". Apt, since a single look at him makes it very clear that he is no longer the human being he once was.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>: Hartman considers himself the world's foremost resercher in the Dark Presence and demeans the Bureau for not wanting to work with him. He also believed that he was smart and sane enough to be immune to the corrupting power of the Dark Presence and thus, dived into Cauldron Lake to test this theory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy">It did not end well for him.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>: A manuscript page in <em>Alan Wake</em> demonstrates that Hartman preferred to use others to accomplish his plans, since he lacked both creativity and strength. He&#146;s certainly not lacking in the latter anymore, having become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">The Heavy</a> of the DLC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustThinkOfThePotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustThinkOfThePotential">Just Think of the Potential</a>: As with Alan, Hartman tried to convince the Bureau to work with him to exploit the powers of the Dark Presence. Unfortunately for him, the Bureau did not want to tamper with powers beyond their understanding and confiscated all of his research.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteProofSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteProofSuit">Kryptonite-Proof Suit</a>: The merger between the Hiss and Dark Presence infecting Hartman resulted in this. While even the strongest Taken are vulnerable to as little light as a flashlight, Hartman causes weaker light sources to break by his mere presence. It takes full on floodlights to actually hurt him and dispel his darkness barrier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>: If you&#146;re aware of his interactions with Alan Wake, you&#146;ll know he&#146;s an absolutely contemptible moron who imprisoned and manipulated Alan, in order to harness the reality-warping powers of the Dark Presence for his own ends. But despite managing to escape a terrible fate the first time round, his own foolishness catches up with him all the same. First off, the FBC make a house call, confiscate his research along with his lodge and have him struck off the medical register. Then the Darkness ultimately gets the last laugh when he decides, despite the efforts of the FBC, to double down on his efforts to understand and master its power by diving into Cauldron Lake itself. The Dark Presence ends up spitting him out as one of its Taken playthings, used and abused by the power he sought to abuse himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain">Mana Drain</a>: The darkness around the areas he inhabits is so stifling that it drains Jesse's energy meter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a>: He has a shield of darkness like any Taken, but his is even stronger to the point smaller light sources <em>explode</em> when brought close to him and it takes <em>floodlights</em> to effect him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextVillain">Outside-Context Villain</a>: Jesse was uniquely qualified to take on the Hiss since Polaris negates the Hiss resonance, but the Dark Presence is out of her wheelhouse entirely. This also counts from the way the Dark Presence normally works, as most Taken are vulnerable to even a flashlight...but thanks to the Hiss being in there, weaker light sources break by mere proximity to Hartman and he requires far stronger ones to be harmed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Power at a Price</a>: Alan claims that the merge is less like The Dark Presence and The Hiss merging their powers in him and more like stretching him between them, which could have dire consequences if the two split apart again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>: Hartman, thanks to the power of the Dark Presence, has a darkness shield which renders him immune to conventional weaponry, and unlike Alan, Jesse does not have a flashlight handy and even if she did weaker light sources break in proximity of him, so her battles with him requires her to turn on the House's floodlights to drive him away, as well as stay in areas bright enough to protect yourself from attacks, and deprive him of hiding places so she can hunt him down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>: The entire Investigations Sector was totally abandoned and sealed off to keep him inside, and only Alan sending a message to Jesse brings it to her attention. He was only a Taken at the time (though a very strong one) but the Hiss invasion made him something a lot worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>: Audio logs indicate that he remained as smug as ever even after the disaster of the "Bright Falls AWE" event. (If he had a "punchable face" in <em>Alan Wake,</em> he maintained a "punchable voice" here.) He offers "joint research" with the FBC despite being a lone guy dabbling in forces that an entire government with an infinite budget cannot comprehend, acting like he's the one being generous. He's also positive that his superior mental intellect and preparation will allow him to survive being in the Dark Place like Thomas Zane and Alan Wake did, but he just got gobbled up and turned into a Taken, probably because he had no creativity whatsoever for it to make use of.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: One would think that surviving a brush with death against the force behind the power of Cauldron Lake would make Hartman rethink his life choices, yet it did absolutely nothing to deter him from jumping into the lake itself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">This costs him dearly.</a></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth">Too Spicy for Yog-Sothoth</a>: His current state is the result of the Dark Presence and Hiss being this to <em>each other</em>. When the Hiss found the Thing-That-Had-Been-Hartman, they tried to possess him, only for the Dark Presence inside him to try and do the same back. Neither was able to overpower the other and the end result was their aspects inside of Hartman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">merging together</a> and 'stretching' Hartman between them as they fight over him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeleportation">Villain Teleportation</a>: It's hard to see because he sticks to the shadows, but he likes to flash in and out of existence to chase you around dark areas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion">Voice of the Legion</a>: A staple of both the Hiss and the Taken. Hartman's seems to combine both the reverberation of the former and the random deepening of the latter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>: Alan doesn&#146;t call him "The-Thing-That-Had-Been-Hartman" for nothing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">Weakened by the Light</a>: As you might expect of something at least part-Taken, Hartman really does not like light. Which is good, because he&#146;s otherwise totally immune to attacks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHorror">Word-Salad Horror</a>: Hartman wouldn&#146;t be a Taken if he didn&#146;t spew random nonsense phrases. Notably, unlike most Taken, very little of what he says originates from his own personality, with much of it coming from either the Hiss Incantation or Alan&#146;s Hotline messages, implying that the dual presence of the Hiss and the Dark Presence is overpowering his remaining sense of self.</li></ul></div><p></p><h2>Others</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board&nbsp;</div><div id="folder21" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><div class="indent"><span class="asscaps">&lt;You/We wield the Gun/You.

If it's true that he has powers like Jesse's, then he's capable of mowing down an army barehanded and by himself.

It is said to look generally like "every roadside motel" at once, suggesting it's part of the collective unconscious.

However, it's implied that he's improved his grasp of English over the years since his discovery, as some of his words are actually comprehensible in context: For instance, "head" actually does mean "head", he refers to Jesse as "lady" when annoyed with her failure to understand him, and "gerbil" appears to be his word for the FBC investigators, judging by his description of the head of the Investigations sector as "Chief Gerbil."</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder28');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paranatural Entity A- 010 "The Shade" (UNMARKED SPOILERS)&nbsp;</div><div id="folder28" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">The Dark Presence</a></h2>The extradimensional entity that dwells beneath Cauldron Lake, currently trapped in the Dark Place alongside Alan Wake.<p>For more information, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/AlanWake">its game's character page</a>.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero">Create Your Own Hero</a>: It's the one granting Alan Wake his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewritingReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewritingReality">Rewriting Reality</a> powers...which it's implied he then used to create Jesse for the expressed purpose of making someone to help free him from the Dark Place and defeat the Presence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Create Your Own Villain</a>: In a sense; it helped inspire Alan Wake's creation of the Hiss, and the two entities are shown to <em>despise</em> each other in <em>AWE</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">Dark Is Evil</a>: It's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> associated with darkness, to the point where it essentially <em>is</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalFear">Primal Fear</a> of darkness and nighttime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>: A sentient virus made of shadows from outside our perceived universe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a>: Both it and the Hiss are fighting for control over Dr. Emil Hartman's body in the <em>AWE</em> expansion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>: For <em>AWE</em>.
