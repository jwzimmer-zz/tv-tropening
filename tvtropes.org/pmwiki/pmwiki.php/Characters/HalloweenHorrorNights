You don't know Jack!"</em></div><p>Jack was the first original Icon of the event; and arguably the event's most popular and recognized Icon. His first appearance was in in the event's 10th year in 2000. The artwork for the event's advertising had his face based on the likeness of former Art &amp; Design member J. Michael Roddy; who served a prime role in the creation of the character.</p><p>Born as Jack Schmidt in the Shady Brook Asylum in the late 1800's, Jack as an adult became a clown working for Dr. Oddfellow's Carnival of Thrills. Jack was a serial killer who had murdered 13 children, and as the police began to close in on Halloween night in 1920, he attempted to enlist Oddfellow's help in hiding the evidence before showing him where he hid the dead children. Rather than bring down the police on the carnival (as Oddfellow himself was wanted for the deaths of several in a freak circus accident), he killed Jack and hid his body along with those of the children inside the carnival's "House of Horrors" exhibit. Several years later, Oddfellow had the carnival sold off and its assets split between numerous people. 60 years later, sometime around the 1980's, a BBC crew doing a documentary on the great dark rides of America in uncovered the "House of Horrors" and accidentally discovered the corpses inside a giant jack-in-the-box. Around the time of Halloween, the crew was found dead, and the van carrying the corpses disappeared into a swamp.</p><p>Following that event, numerous urban legend retellings of the tale arised, the legends also stating stories of this clown corpse killing again, in thirst of vengeance against Dr. Oddfellow for his betrayal. The urban legends concluded with the statement that anyone that releases Jack from his oversized jack-in-the-box by turning the crank will receive a "special reward" from the clown himself.</p><p>In the year 2000, the "House of Horrors" exhibit was recovered and bought by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios">Universal Studios</a> for their annual Halloween event. Knowing of the urban legend, one employee attempted to put the claim of a "special reward" to the test and turned the crank for the infamous box. Jack, now fully unleashed and back from the dead, proceeded to kill the employee; and in celebration of his return, lead a take over of the entire Florida park in order to create a Halloween event that no one would soon forget.</p><p>It would not be long before Jack made his reappearance at the event, as due to 9/11, the 2001 event was toned down and Jack was made the Icon once more, as the originally intended Icon was seen as too violent (Eddie Schmidt, originally intended as Edgar Sawyer before being retconned as Jack's brother).</p><p>Jack returned in the 2004 house <em>Horror Night Nightmares</em>, where for the first time he teamed up with not only with the event's newer Icons, but also his brother Eddie (in what was his first actual appearance). He yet again made another appearance in 2005, serving as the barker for a "Rat Run" maze that was used during the event's peak nights. He was back once more for the event's "Sweet 16", having been resurrected a second time along with the other Icons by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend1985">The Lord of Darkness</a>. He was captured and sent to the Shady Brook Asylum, incidentally reuniting him with his birthplace. Over time, his mere presence began to have a noticeable influence on the inmates; to the point that he was able to rally them to riot and break free along with making him their leader.</p><p>Jack made a comeback once <em>again</em> for 2007 event. Having discovered that Dr. Oddfellow is still alive after all these years and running a new travelling carnival, Jack tracked him down and murdered him, finally achieving his revenge. With Oddfellow dead, Jack took over his carnival, turning it into his own twisted utopia. For his new "Carnival of Carnage", he traveled the world to find the most demented freaks imaginable. He eventually managed to recruit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">Freddy Krueger</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th">Jason Voorhees</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">Leatherface</a> to serve as his main sideshows. Along with that, to assist him personally, he recruited his own personal henchmen; Tiny and Chance, the latter of whom would go on to become his girlfriend.</p><p>For the event's 20th anniversary in 2010, Jack was made into one of the heralds for the return of the entity known as "Fear", who secretly was behind the happenings of the event all the way from the beginning. As his herald, Jack was the representation of "Chaos". Following the end of Fear's reign, Jack, along with the other heralds were sucked into the entity's lantern, thought to be gone forever.</p><p>This would turn out not to be the case, however, as he and the other Icons were released from the lantern by an unknown source. Following his escape, he started his "Carnival of Carnage" again for the event's 25th year, gathering together his own massive legion of "Maniacs" that included Freddy, Jason, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">Walkers</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insidious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insidious">inhabitants of "The Further"</a>, all of his fellow Icon "friends", and numerous other characters from the event's past.</p><p>After the end of the Carnival, Jack mysteriously vanishes. The only thing that remains of him is a lone Jack-In-The-Box that's kept with the police on an evidence shelf, with it being said that he'll return when someone turns the crank once more.</p><p>With official (non-Easter Egg) appearances in houses and scarezones in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2015, Jack has the most appearances of any Icon with 8. He's also made hidden appearances in houses in 2003, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016, giving him a total of 13 appearances over the years of Orlando's event.</p><p>In all of his media appearances and in most of his in-park appearances, he's been played by stage actor James Keaton since his creation in 2000.</p><p>Jack also appeared at Universal Studios Hollywood's Horror Nights event, but with a completely different backstory (simplified to be a horror movie crazed Shady Brook inmate who escaped and was causing trouble on the Universal Studios backlot), but has yet to make another appearance since.</p><p>He also made his debut at Universal Studios Singapore's HHN in 2014, holding his own house titled <em>Jack's 3-D Dementia</em>, and a live show known as <em>Jack's Nightmare Circus</em>. He returned to the event in 2016, where he held another show, this time called <em>Jack's Recurring Nightmare Circus</em>.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a>: He loves to soak up the spotlight more than any other character the event has created.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>: If there's anything he loves more than anything, it's murder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>: Will kill his own minions if they step out of line, even threatening to do such to Chance at one time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>: At the start of <em>The Carnage Returns</em>, he essentially proclaims himself the ruler of HHN.<div class="indent"><strong>Jack</strong>: You've forgotten that I am the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight">thing that goes bump in the night</a>.

me and lose your way <br>I'm right behind you, here to stay."</em></div><p>Dr. Albert Caine was once a respected surgeon who worked as the caretaker of the Shady Oaks Cemetery in Willamette Valley, Ohio. Converting his Victorian-style mansion into a funeral parlor and mortuary, Caine became obsessed with the concept of the soul, digging up bodies to experiment on. He began tricking homeless people into staying at his mansion so that he could perform live autopsies. He grew more and more insane, performing experiments on fear, pain, and the limits of the human mind. His family held grisly dinner parties with the corpses and his psychopathic assistants stole body parts to make into dinner ingredients. One night, some teenagers walking through the graveyard saw the Caines dancing with bodies in their parlor, and they were placed under house arrest. An angry mob of local families burned down the house with the family in it, but the bodies were not recovered.</p><p>Initially the Icon for 2002 was Cindy Bearer, daughter of the mortician Paul Bearer (who made extra money selling human flesh from butcher shops), and the event was based around her demented mind and playthings. A rash of child kidnappings in the area led to Cindy being scrapped (though she would reappear in 2006 as a corpse and later as a full character in 2010), and her father was given the reins to become Dr. Caine. He would appear again in 2003 with a sequel to his famous house, Screamhouse, and again in 2004, 2006, 2010, and 2015. Along with all that, a little-known fact is that The Caretaker was also the icon of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKw_TSX7Png">PortAventura's Halloween event in 2003<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, before Universal sold their stake in the park. This made him the first icon to be used outside Orlando's event.</p><p>In the commercials for the 2002 event, he was portrayed by actor <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831902/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Hank Stone<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and in many of his in-park appearances he was portrayed by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2111964/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Bryce Ward<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>Despite his name, he isn't exactly an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker">The Caretaker</a>.

Inevitably, he became a snuff film director well known throughout the underground circles of Europe, but his first project, <em>The Widow's Eye</em>, was controversial enough to result in him being forced out of his country to flee to America. Paulo was hired in 2003 to direct Halloween Horror Nights, but he turned it into his dream project and began populating the park with real horrors.</p><p>The Director was the Icon for 2003 and would later appear in 2004, 2006, 2010, and 2015. He was also chosen by Universal Studios Hollywood (under the name Pavel Pranevsky) in 2006 as the Icon for their new Halloween Horror Nights event, which had gone through two short runs in the 90s beforehand. Hollywood slightly changed the character: he was banned from ever setting foot in Universal Studios after executives saw his graphic films, but he took up residence on an abandoned backlot set and took over the park during October. His voice was also changed from a light American accent to a gravelly, indeterminately Eastern European one. The Director (with a different actor) appeared as the Icon for Singapore's inaugural Horror Nights event.

Upon stepping out of the limo and taking the stage, the mob booed and shouted, trying to get past riot police squads. Ignoring the crowd and taking the stage and waving to his supporters, Jonah announced, "Citizens of the world, you were wise to elect me! I hereby stand as the first World Leader! Submit to my rule, and we will rise FOR ETERNITY!" Suddenly, two protesters broke through and opened fired at the newly elected ruler. Suddenly, the man stood up and revealed his true form: a horned demon with huge, bat-like wings. With a snap of his fingers, he set the two protesters on fire and declared that his rule has begun.<hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>: Nobody likes him.

His backstory and name was then altered due to several corporate-based conflicts, as he was deemed too similar to the murderous family from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em> because of him also having "Sawyer" as his last name, and one of the Vivendi executives at the time, Edgar Bronfman Jr., was less-than-amused at having one of the event's killer icons share the same name as him. For these reasons, he was turned into Eddie Schmidt, Jack's younger yet more vicious brother.</p><p>Originally intended to be the Icon for Halloween Horror Nights XI, Eddie would've performed a hostile takeover of the event from Jack, hanging him and slicing his head off shortly after; and then finally proclaim the event his, promising it to be "more gorier than ever before." However, everything then changed, as due to the devastating occurrence of 9/11/2001, the event in general that year was toned down to avoid offending anyone, with almost all traces of blood, gore, and death being removed; replaced with a more traditional fantasy-kind of horror. This lead to Eddie himself being scrapped as the icon, with executives feeling that he looked too much like a terrorist. He was replaced with the return of Jack the Clown that year, who fits in with the more "fantasy-horror" theme they were going for.</p><p>These sudden changes resulted in much marketing confusion, as advertisements and merchandise with Eddie's likeness had already been produced and it was too late and costly to pull all of them. In a move many found baffling, marketing simply stated that this masked man <em>was</em> Jack, and it was just an alternate look for him. Fans obviously did not buy this, knowing about the Eddie character and the fact that he did not look even remotely like Jack, which lead to a bit of backlash; criticizing what they viewed as a knee-jerk reaction.</p><p>Eddie being Jack himself was ultimately retconned after this event and the two were made separate characters again in 2004, where Eddie was one of the main characters in the <em>Horror Night Nightmares</em> house, which had a whole room dedicated to him. Despite being counted as an icon in 2004, he wounded up being demoted to simply a major character in 2006, in which he received his own house titled <em>RUN: Hostile Territory</em>, which was about running his own torture-house business following the bankruptcy of his and Jack's original "RUN" game show. He would reappear again with other icons again in 2010, celebrating the return of Fear. He once more appeared in 2015, serving as one of Jack's "Maniacs". The <em>Body Collectors: Recollections</em> house from that same year reveals that he was born along with Jack inside the Shadybrook Asylum in the late 1800's.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>: In order to emulate his personal movie slasher heroes, he kills just as much as they do.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">Catchphrase</a>: I.C.U. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28mt7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28mt7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28mt7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"I see you"</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">Chainsaw Good</a>: A chainsaw is his preferred weapon, in homage to Leatherface from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepySouvenir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepySouvenir">Creepy Souvenir</a>: His room in 2004's <em>Horror Night Nightmares</em> shows that he collects the ripped-off faces of his victims.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>: Despite being cut in 2001, he was still treated as one of the icons as a wink to the fans.

She continued on with her own money in a small office in or near New York City in 1958, but only succeeded in sending two patients to the hospital and causing one to commit suicide. As her own fear of death was subdued by seeing death, she began purposely killing her patients while becoming obsessed with her reflection and mirrors. A private investigator, Boris Shuster, began investigating the disappearing patients and made an appointment with her. On the night of the appointment, Mary was murdered by a patient and ex-con who escaped the electric chair he had been placed in; no body was recovered. Shuster founded the Legendary Truth paranormal research team to investigate various paranormal activity, especially the legend of Bloody Mary, and during an investigation into the destroyed office in 2008 the team disappeared.<p>Bloody Mary was the Icon of 2008 and the first Icon since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt">Crypt Keeper</a> in 1995 to be based on an existing character. Her backstory was elaborately told through her journal entries, increasingly deranged sketches, and medical files on the patients, chronicling her descent into murder and madness.

Passionate - Seductive - Sensual. Unusual athletic prowess when excited. Fashionable. Proud. Unusually well-groomed.</li><li> The Cerebins are powerful and exhibit innate animal instinct. Given to might rather than reason, they are perceptive with extraordinary sensory capabilities and enjoy nighttime darkness undisturbed. But they miss nothing. Primal. Athletic. Muscular. Quick movers. Given to physical fitness, especially weight training.</li><li> The Baccanoids are stealthy, disciplined and agile. Smarter than most, they pride themselves on their peak physical condition and like to change appearance often. Obsessive. Quick. Disciplined. Societal. Inquisitive. Excellent problem solvers, they love puzzles, riddles and games.</li><li> The Maschorians are strong but can be cruel to those of lesser ability. They travel in gangs and are masters of mechanical weaponry that are more than compensating for any lack of physical superiority. A Maschorian pack is almost always organized and each individual is descended from the strongest dominant leaders. Tribal. Hierarchal. Deceptively strong of body, they are even stronger of will.</li><li> The Morphans are cleverly deceptive. Given to elaborate disguise, they are generally small in stature and delight in practical jokes, pranks and surprises. Playful to fault. But can be vindictive, vengeful and mean-spirited when insulted. At times, immature in behavior, but they do have fun and love to party.</li><li> The Kerezans are relentless, do not move fast, but will not stop. Although they appear to unite in one group, these are individuals out for themselves with absolutely no interest in others of their line...and it is just by coincidence they have gathered in their pursuit of sustenance. Singular and focused. Unconcerned what others think.

When Universal Studios Hollywood began opening the nighttime studio tram tours in the summer of 2016, guests began to notice a mysterious clown wandering around the backlot. When they posted videos and photos of him on the internet, speculation on who the clown was spread like wildfire. Local Los Angeles residents soon identified the clown as Harold Kappowitz also known as Koodles the Clown. In the late 1950s, the former circus performer hosted a children's variety show that was filmed on the backlot. When Universal Studios Hollywood opened in 1964, Koodles was used as an unofficial mascot for the park. Then times changed. Due to sensationalized news stories and unflattering depictions in the media, clowns were no longer viewed as funny, cartoonish characters beloved by children, but as scary monsters. By the 1970s, circus attendance plummeted along with Kappowitz's fortunes. He lost his job and was reduced to becoming an unpaid street performer outside the studio gates. A few years later, he was unceremoniously kicked off the property all together due to his increasingly erratic behavior. Kappowitz vanished into the Hollywood Hills and Koodles the Clown faded into near obscurity. For decades, his presence remained unnoticed despite the disappearing wildlife in the area and the occasional studio tour guide going missing, both of which were merely brushed aside as merely being the company expanding the park and the transient nature of seasonal employees. However, Kappowitz got bolder and got closer to the Universal Studios backlot where he was spotted by multiple guests and became known as Hollywood Harry on the Internet. As the 2016 season went on and as the internet speculation reached a fevered pitch, so-called "clown hunters" decided to go hunting for the phantom clown, only to discover that he was not alone. He employed dozens of other fired and/or disenfranchised circus performers and clowns to join him in his crusade to get back at the people who fired them.<p>In 2018, Hollywood Harry returns to tell his own Deadtime Stories: Who Let The Dogz Out?, Kill Billy's Inn, The Scarecrow's Revenge and Clownz On A Plane.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedKidsShowHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedKidsShowHost">Depraved Kids' Show Host</a>: He develops a Crypt Keeper-like personality when he introduces his Deadtime Stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>: He wants revenge on Universal Studios for firing him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Monster Clown</a>: Ironically, this trope was the reason he became one.

In fact, human blood was what powered the very source of the land: the Gorewood Tree, the result of a black oak sapling taking root in an ancient battlefield, absorbing the enzymes and human remains that soaked the ground until it grew and transformed into a monstrous tree that was more mineral than vegetable. Every Season of the Queen, the plump, purple fruits known as Bloodberries grew from its iron vines, which was then used to create a super addictive wine. In order to produce more Bloodberries, a nightly sacrificial ritual was performed at the throne carved from the tree. A ritual that demanded fresh sacrifice, virgin Blade and renewed devotion to the Terra Queen. It was the duty of the Bone Chopper Riders (AKA the Black Guard) to travel throughout the land and find and deliver the necessary ingredients needed for the next sacrifice.<p>There were six realms located in this horrible land.</p><ul><li> Terra Gate: The very entrance of Terra Cruentus, guarded by horrific winged creatures. Humans were drawn here almost as if under a spell, perhaps by a Storyteller's words? Beyond the gate was the very source of Terra Cruentus: the Terra Throne where the Rituale du Blude took place every night.</li><li> Iron Bone Gorge: A realm ruled by gangs of rowdy bikers and seducing succubi. The Black Guard celebrated their devotion to the Terra Queen with a final drink of Bloodberry wine before beginning their duty.</li><li> South Hollow: A realm that was once part of one land of hope and life before a rift split it into two lands of darkness. In the south, jesters and fools ruled the night, creating a land of confusion and dementia.</li><li> Gorewood Forest: A realm of internment, patience, and metamorphosis. Bodies of the Rituale du Blude's victims were brought to the Cemetery Mines and were placed into the ground in order for their bones to become iron and their flesh to become stone. Near the mines was the Body Collectors' facility, where humans, dead or alive, were used to create decorations, weapons and clothing. The Body Collectors were also responsible for the creation of the Terra Throne Blade's haft, made from human femur. Across the way was the Skool, where the children of Terra Cruentus learned the ways of the land and played Dead Man's Wishes.</li><li> Dragon Forge: A blistering realm that stank of ash and smoke, the Terra Throne Blade was created here, made from the iron in human blood. The Fire Pits' ore mongers gathered the materials needed for the Blade's creation from the Terror Mines. The leftover parts were made into weapons and torture devices used by the defrocked monks in the village of Blood Ruins.</li><li> North Hollow: A realm that was once part of one land of hope and life before a rift split it into two lands of darkness.
