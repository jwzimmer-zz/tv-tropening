The black-clad group debuted in November 2012 at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series</a></em> pay-per-view during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback">Ryback</a> Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship. The trio made an immediate impact as they attacked Ryback and put him through the announcer table, using their triple powerbomb maneuver to incapacitate him. After that, The Shield ran rampant in WWE, destroying anyone who got in their way. As part of their gimmick, their goal was "bringing justice" to WWE, even if it meant attacking fan-favorite wrestlers for no apparent reason.</p><p>By August 19, 2013 <em>Raw</em>, they were clearly the hired goons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>, the new group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BradMaddox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BradMaddox">Brad Maddox</a>. The group began to distance itself from the Authority in 2014, ultimately pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">face turn</a> and finally breaking away from the Authority the night after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> XXX</em>. As a result of said distancing, the Authority re-formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a> to deal with the Shield &amp; the two factions feuded until the night after <em>Payback</em>, when Rollins turned on Ambrose and Reigns. Reigns and Ambrose, whilst still remaining allies, went their separate ways the following week.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>At one point during the time the stable was active, each member held a WWE title: Ambrose was WWE United States Champion (and holds the record for longest reign of any United States champion since WWE acquired the title from WCW), and Reigns and Rollins were WWE Tag Team Champions together under the banner of the Shield. Rollins also held the NXT Championship early on in the Shield's run. Each member would also eventually go on to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (by pinning one of the others, no less).</p><p>On the October 9, 2017 episode of <em>Raw,</em> the Shield finally officially reunited when Rollins and Ambrose joined Reigns again to destroy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a>, his Miztourage (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtisAxel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtisAxel">Curtis Axel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas">Bo Dallas</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman">Braun Strowman</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar">The Bar</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Cesaro</a>). Although this run was cut short by an injury to Ambrose, they reunited again at the end of the RAW after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> 2018</em> when Ambrose and Rollins came out to save Universal Champion Reigns from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> cash-in by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman">Braun Strowman</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Unfortunately, the Shield dissolved once more on the October 22, 2018 episode of <em>RAW</em> after Reigns was forced to relinquish the Universal Championship and take a hiatus from wrestling thanks to the return of his leukemia. That same night, after winning the RAW Tag Team Championships for the second time, Ambrose snapped and turned on Rollins, ending the Shield for the foreseeable future...</p><p>...which lasted for all of 5 months, when Reigns returned after announcing that he had entered remission and was thus clear to wrestle again. Upon coming back, he motioned to reform the Shield one more time given that Ambrose had officially announced his decision to (legitimately) walk away from the WWE. Despite not giving a clear-cut answer when both Rollins and Reigns saved him from several attacks despite his attitude towards the both of them since October, he finally relented to a final reunion. Unfortunately, this was almost certainly a "final" reunion as Ambrose left WWE in early 2019 and proceeded to effectively burn his bridges with the company, making a later return to them and one more reunion of the Shield <em>extremely</em> unlikely.</p><p>Not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">FX cop drama</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">agency</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainPatriotic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainPatriotic">superhero</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2> "TANGO- ROMEO- OSCAR- PAPA- ECHO- SIERRA: TROPES":</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent">Alternate Company Equivalent</a>:<ul><li> In aesthetic, tactics and roles, The Shield resembled the Japanese stable Crazy MAX from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate">Toryumon Japan,</a> almost to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> levels.

Moreover, this doesn't seem to have ever been the original plan.

Their entrance video &amp; merchandise, whilst still retaining the overall theme of a mercenary group, added similar elements - for example, the opening of their entrance video changed from spelling out "SHIELD" as the NATO Military Alphabet was spelt out in their theme song, to the glowing eyes of three rabid dogs.

Even after they broke up, the idea of the three ever reuniting is enough to terrify everyone except those who stand at the very top of the card &mdash; the <em>very</em> top, seeing as all three in the interim had become main event caliber competitors and world champions.

This included attempting to eliminate Reigns in the 2014 Royal Rumble, which sent an internal torpedo to the typical "stable plans to eliminate everyone else in a battle royal or multi-man match before having it out themselves" angle, and attacking Mark Henry after Reigns had already defeated Henry clean in about three minutes flat.

That's only the tip of the iceberg. Both debuts involved Ryan Reeves in some way. As Skip Sheffield, he was one of the eight members of the Nexus involved in the attack on the WWE Raw set, while as Ryback, he was the main target of the Shield's first attack.) Even more ironic is the fact that both stables had a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">ROH</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/roh/roh-h.html">World Heavyweight Champion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as a member.

All of this, of course, wasn't lost on Ambrose, who promptly rebuked those comparisons.</li><li> The Nexus splinter group, The Corre. Both stables focus(ed) on unity over solidarity, the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, and teamwork above all else.

The Shield is one of the best examples of a pro wrestling team's whole being greater than the sum of its parts.

However, when one of their members faces a main-eventer one-on-one, it tends not to be a competitive affair. JBL, on commentary, strongly supports the claim that no three superstars put together, no matter how good individually, can defeat The Shield if The Shield's opponents don't have experience teaming with one another. In short, each of the members individually is not main-event caliber. Together, as a unit, this no longer applied, and they ARE main-event caliber as a trio, with many in-universe even referring to them as possibly the greatest three-man tandem in the history of WWE.</li><li> Played straight as time went on, with all three men becoming legitimate main eventers in their own right.

Both are trios with heavy emphasis on camaraderie and brotherhood, but while the Shield are serious types that were hellbent on dominating WWE, either as a group or individually, the New Day are more-or-less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">lethal joke characters</a> that happen to be extremely competent. The Shield wear darkly-colored SWAT gear as ring attire, the New Day revel in their campy and brightly-colored tights and shirts. The New Day's entrance has them entering from the stage and dissing their competition on their way down the ramp. The Shield enter silently from the stands and rarely horse around in the ring. The members of the Shield were rookies that banded together to make an impact for their debuts and used the popularity of their faction to springboard their singles careers. The New Day were originally three wrestlers drifting on the card that united together and became relevant again as one of the most popular acts in WWE. This even applies to the individual members, as seen in the actual match:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston">Kofi Kingston</a>, as the two most decorated members of their teams. Both of them were the first member of their respective stables to become Triple Crown and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GrandSlamChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GrandSlamChampion">Grand Slam Champions</a>; conversely, Ambrose was the last member of the Shield to win a world title while Kofi was the first.

Besides the intense love of video games, both are the respective "strategists" of their teams. Rollins is the one who makes up the plans that Ambrose and Reigns follow, and during their first run was the glue that held the team together. Xavier doesn't take part in the New Day's regular tag matches often, content to stay on the sidelines and provide support, and when the referee is distracted, helps the team cheat to win.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston">Big E Langston</a> are the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">muscle</a>" of their respective groups. Reigns' spear is the most devastating singles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> in the Shield's arsenal (followed closely by Ambrose's Dirty Deeds), and his power is the backbone of the team's signature triple powerbomb. Big E's power provides a similar backbone for most of the New Day's tag team maneuvers, not just their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, and he is widely regarded as the most effective member of the New Day as a singles competitor.</li></ul></li><li> To <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a>, as indicated under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar">Not So Similar</a> below. By the time of their feud, both stables were comprised of members that had the potential to be single stars on their own. The difference is, Evolution's members had already fulfilled that potential &mdash; the Shield were still technically rookies, who individually weren't quite on the level of their respective counterparts yet, but together trumped the full force of Evolution, who had a hard time co-existing as a unit because the sheer amount of bad history between them. To say nothing of the fact that the Shield maintained themselves as a stable of equals, while Evolution initially only existed to keep Hunter on top and help him escape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>'s shadow, and then reunited because they wanted to get rid of The Shield. As far as individual members go:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. Orton's ousting from Evolution was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, and it was only after he was driven to complete insanity five years later that he was finally able to get his revenge on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> for what happened, by wreaking havoc on his life and terrorizing his family. By contrast, Ambrose's snapping point was not being ousted from his stable, but rather a fellow member betraying him and Reigns &mdash; Rollins. Unlike Orton, Ambrose's insanity and out-of-control behavior proved to be a detriment, and as time went on the stable's break up actually caused him to gradually develop into a more collected (if still certifiably insane) individual. Ambrose only achieved his goal to get revenge on Rollins by waiting for an opportune moment and allowing Rollins to dismiss and underestimate him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>. Rollins broke up the Shield in order to ally himself with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a> for greater opportunities and perks. Hunter kept Evolution together just to have some people back his world title reign, only to kick out Orton when he beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> and took the spotlight off him and then try to manipulate Batista into jumping to <em>SmackDown!</em> after the latter won the 2005 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> and had the opportunity for Hunter's title (which Batista did, after it became clear that if he stayed in Evolution, Hunter would never let him out of <em>his</em> shadow). There's also their reactions to the destruction of their respective stables: Hunter felt bad about the broken friendships, but ultimately never regretted what he did. Rollins constantly lied about his relationships with Ambrose and Reigns, stating that he never considered them his "brothers", but there were many tells that he was lying to everyone, including himself. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> betrayed <em>him</em>, the illusion broke, and it became clear that even before then, deep down, he considered breaking up the Shield to be the biggest mistake of his life, one that he was so desperate to fix that he was willing to take a steel chair to the back if it meant one of his brothers forgave him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>. Batista betrayed the remaining members of Evolution once it became clear he'd never have the spotlight as long as he stayed with them. Reigns was forced to focus on singles career after Rollins betrayed him, and him and Ambrose still remained on good terms. Batista was also always an egotistical jerkass at his core, even as a face, and when he was denied the spotlight one too many times, snapped and allowed his true colors to be shown to the crowd. Reigns, despite the Shield's beginnings, was ultimately an honorable and genuinely good person from the start, and his descent into cocky, asshole-ish behavior was a result of the crowd's vitriol combined with being constantly screwed out of the world title.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">Forgiveness</a>: The theme of the storyline that eventually led to their reunion and second run.

Even after Rollins turned face, other than some brief, heat-of-the-moment team-ups, the two of them still had a lot of tension between them that came to a boil when they both ran afoul of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a>, his Miztourage, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar">The Bar</a>. Stuck in an unwilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situation, Rollins decided it was finally time to bridge the gap between them. As far as Ambrose was concerned, however, that bridge was burnt; even though it became increasingly obvious that he honestly wished it wasn't. Rollins spent <em>weeks</em> trying to earn back Ambrose's forgiveness, only to become increasingly frustrated over Ambrose's constant flip-flopping over it. When Ambrose was finally receptive to the idea, Rollins <em>rejected him</em>, pissing off Ambrose again. The following week, it was finally clear that talking it out was no longer an option, and the two ended up brawling with each other in order to finally release all their frustrations. It was only after that was reconciliation in reach.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio">Freudian Trio</a>: Played with.

Apparently prepared for this, The Shield were implied to have bullied Raw general manager Brad Maddox into making Reigns and Ambrose official guest ring announcers for the match (all that was said is that Maddox had something to do with the decision, and that he was "in the trainer's room" during the match).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>: Their match at Fastlane 2019 was presented as this to The Shield as a whole.

When the relationship between Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns became strained over the course of their late 2013 feud with their former unwitting client <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, one could argue that he was the one keeping The Shield together. Eventually it reached a breaking point&#133;for <em>Seth</em>, causing him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a> during a match against the Wyatt Family, which he amazingly used to bring the two <em>back on the same page</em>. Ultimately deconstructed, as Rollins pointed out that one of the reasons he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turned on them</a> was being tired of being the one that made them get along.</li><li> Seems to be Ambrose, in their 2017-2018 run. Reigns and Rollins frequently refer to their injured brother and have made it clear that no one can replace him in the Shield. Which makes sense, when you think about it &#151; out of all them, Ambrose is the one who took the group's breakup the hardest, and it was only his forgiveness of Rollins that made their reunion possible in the first place.</li><li> In fact, an argument can be made that all three members functioned as this at one point both during and after the Shield's initial run. Both Roman and Dean were closer to Seth during their first run. When Seth turned back to face and made amends with Roman, it was Roman who was the Heart during the occasional Shield reunion. When Seth made up with Dean and became Tag Team Champions with him, Dean became the Heart.</li><li> After Ambrose's return from injury, Reigns returned to the role, as he played peacemaker between Ambrose and Rollins. When he was forced to go on hiatus to battle his leukemia, Ambrose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">snapped</a> and turned on Rollins a few hours later.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>: This happened in early 2014 when they turned against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Hero Killer</a>: The last we saw of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> in 2013, he was getting mauled by The Hounds of Justice, effectively killing him (or at least his screen time).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">He's Back</a>: Years after their famous split, the Shield finally reunited on <em>RAW</em> on October 9, 2017.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>: The rare three-way example, both onscreen and arguably in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> (Rollins admitted to having a picture of the Shield in his home, and it's a well-known fact that prior to the second brand extension, Reigns and Ambrose were traveling buddies).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Yes</a>.

After the team of Orton, Daniel Bryan, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> defeated The Shield by disqualification, Orton struck with an RKO to Bryan first, and then Cena (each unprovoked). He procured his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> briefcase, and a referee, from ringside, and appeared ready to cash in his contract on then-WWE Champion John Cena... until The Shield made their way back towards the ring.

This probably would have spelled the end of the trio, if it weren't for the fact that they <em>never did this again</em>: Not long after this event, the Shield were brought on as the muscle for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>, and Cena (probably the only person in the locker room that would have had the pull to try this again) went down with an injury.

For example, Orton was targeted for "destroying" Brad Maddox's hopes of a WWE contract, even though Maddox <em>asked</em> for the match and knew the level of opposition he'd face would be a crap-shoot at best.</li><li> The logic that The Shield itself runs on in general is pretty dubious at best.

And after losing the tag team titles to Ambrose and Rollins as a result of their idiocy, when Miz approached them to jump Reigns and keep him away from the Intercontinental Championship, <em>they actually accepted and did so</em> in spite of Reigns' absolute best efforts to have them all stay independent. It seems it never once occurred to Miz or the Bar that the reason the Shield hadn't reunited now that they were on the same page was because no one had given them a reason to &#151; until <em>now</em>, that is.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a>: This is pretty much their hat.

Dean's as insane as Randy (possibly even more so), and was only driven even more insane by Seth's betrayal, his hatred consuming him to the point of obsession &mdash; much like how Randy started hearing voices because he was ousted from Evolution thanks to Hunter's jealousy.

Conversely, Evolution was born out of convenience &#151; Triple H needed muscle to back his title reign, and Orton and Batista needed tickets to the big time. When the latter two started infringing on his spotlight, he didn't hesitate to kick them both to the curb for it.

They <em>probably</em> would've won the fourth one, had it not been for Evolution distracting them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a>: Roman is the only person of color in the group, being of Samoan heritage.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33n27');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note33n27" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33n27');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His mother is Italian, but this is never brought up in the WWE</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>:<ul><li> Played <em>wonderfully</em> straight throughout the end of 2013 and into 2014. There was so much tension between Ambrose and Reigns that just about any other team/stable in WWE history would have long since imploded on itself&mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">it seemed painfully obvious</a> that WWE's creative team was setting up a team-wide split (possibly to turn Roman Reigns face and give him a push). However, thanks to the fact that Seth Rollins is apparently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmaster</a> of the group (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> above), they actually became <em>stronger.</em> Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a> above.</li><li> Since Rollins' betrayal he's claimed that while Reigns and Ambrose looked at The Shield as a brotherhood and he himself played to that image, the truth is he considered them nothing more than business partners. Oddly enough, Seth Rollins may have just started setting himself up as the new Ultimate Opportunist by deconstructing this very trope.</li><li> Played straight between Reigns and Ambrose since the separation. Most notably, at Payback 2015 during the Fatal 4 Way involving all three Shield boys and Randy Orton, the three Triple Powerbombed Orton, then Ambrose and Reigns beat down Rollins. Left to each other, Reigns noted "Not much else to do!", prompting a "'fraid not" from Ambrose. Reigns responded "Loser buys the beers!" before the two got back into the ring with the intent of fighting honorably.</li><li> The biggest obstacle to the Shield's reunion in 2017 was the broken trust between Ambrose and Rollins. Reigns forgave Rollins during the latter half of 2016, after the two became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> again while acting cohesively against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Owens</a>. Ambrose and Rollins, however, still had a ton of tension between them even after Rollins turned face. Part of this is because, during the initial run, the two of them were closest pair of the the trio; more than one person has remarked that the two of them acted more like a tag team than Rollins and Reigns did, and that pair became the WWE Tag Team Champions at one point. Dean took Seth's betrayal far, far worse than Roman did, and the resulting blood feud lasted over two years. And yet, despite all that, despite <em>everything</em> that happened between them ever since the Shield broke up, when Seth offered his back to Dean, willingly allow himself to be hit with a steel chair like he had done to his brothers all those years ago...Dean ultimately couldn't go through with it. It took weeks of arguing and brawling to get there, but the two finally reunited as a team and forgave each other, and after that the re-formation of the Shield became inevitable.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>: Subverted. Ever since their alliance with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, this has been toned down for the stable (not to say that they follow his orders without question). And Ambrose, while plenty crazy, seems to try to keep some semblance of focus for the sake of the team. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">(Operative word being "try.")</a> There's no telling how far off the deep end Ambrose would go without Seth Rollins to pull him back occasionally. This was actually lampshaded by Rollins after he turned on them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a><ul><li> In a traditional five-on-five Survivor Series tag-team elimination match, Reigns and Rollins found themselves at a five-on-two disadvantage (much different than what The Hounds are used to) towards the end of the bout. Two Spears from Roman Reigns take out Jimmy Uso and Cody Rhodes. Rollins' curb stomp ("The Blackout") then eliminates Jey Uso. After Rey Mysterio pins Rollins, Reigns is alone against Rey and Goldust. Two Spears later, Roman Reigns has pinned both men, giving him four of the five eliminations for his team (tying a record for Survivor Series 5-on-5 matches). There was very minimal cheating<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4cp6l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4cp6l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4cp6l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and none from Reigns&mdash; Rollins attacked Mysterio after being eliminated</span>, no fluke pins in their favor, and no ref bumps: just two teammates who, together, combined to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallacyOfDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallacyOfDivision">greater than the sum of their talents.</a> Their teamwork and level of skill was so good that their cohesion as a group negated the fact that they were outnumbered <strong>five to two</strong> <em>and</em> that they were heels!</li><li> At the 2014 Elimination Chamber in a six-man tag match, the Wyatts actually turned the numbers game on The Shield by managing to take on and take out the members individually, Bray Wyatt brawling off with Ambrose to parts unknown (he wasn't seen again) while Luke Harper and Erick Rowan double-powerbombed Seth Rollins through the commentators' table... cue Roman Reigns fighting off the Wyatt Family single-handedly up until he tried to Spear Bray Wyatt, upon which Harper dove in the way and took the Spear, allowing Wyatt to make a comeback and finish Reigns off too.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a>: Of the effectiveness of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a> developmental system. Individually or together, there is no question that the Shield are by far the most successful wrestlers of their generation in WWE. Within four years of their WWE careers, together all three have won multiple world titles, main evented numerous PPVs, and more-or-less carried the company on their backs. Two of them have already become Grand Slam Champions, with the third only needing one more title to join them (a feat he succeeded at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 34</em>). When people look back at WWE history decades from now, they will see the Shield as the ones that defined this era, and the ultimate success story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship">Villainous Friendship</a>: Type I. Even given the fact that Ambrose was liable to fly off the handle at any moment (even towards his own teammates), the three of them clearly had each others' backs and even went on off-camera field trips to the zoo. This continued when they turned face and then, in Dean and Roman's case, after Seth betrayed them and they decided to individualize. And despite Seth's initial claims of merely terminating a business deal, he's given tells that deep down somewhere he does miss the brotherhood, culminating in them finally reuniting over three years after the betrayal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>:<ul><li> Downplayed between Reigns and Ambrose, since the tension was glaringly obvious. Calling the two "best buds" would probably be a lie (at least before Rollins' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">heel turn</a>). At some point, Ambrose's admittedly impressive (if not just long) reign as United States Champion massively inflated his ego, to the point that he declared himself the best individual wrestler in The Shield. This is despite the fact that Roman Reigns damn near squashed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry">Mark Henry</a> on the February 17, 2014 edition of Raw, when Ambrose got dominated by the World's Strongest Man the week before. Reigns, at the time, also had a (tied) Survivor-Series record, and a standalone Royal-Rumble record, to his name (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour">Villainous Valour</a> above). The only thing Ambrose really had going for him was his status as United States Champion&mdash; a title he defended a grand total of 16 times in 351 days before losing it on the May 5, 2014 episode of Monday Night Raw. That's an average of about once every 22 days; most champions are expected to defend their titles every other week at the very least... plus the fact that 9 of those 16 matches ended in DQ or count-out. After the team nearly experienced a meltdown in late 2013/early 2014, Ambrose's ego seems to have cooled down significantly, however, as has the tension within The Shield. Even through Rollins' betrayal, or perhaps because of it, Dean and Roman don't seem to be missing a beat, and by the time of the Shield's second run, the tension had become a distant memory and the two became bonafide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>.</li><li> During the Shield's second run, Ambrose and Rollins are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> (despite being Tag Team Champions together), as Ambrose never wastes a chance to remind Rollins of the betrayal, albeit with none of the heat that used to color it when they were enemies. Despite that, the two still fight together like a well-oiled machine, and close affection between them has returned in spades.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>: "There's always a Plan B."

While Rollins' fate was obvious after Rowan and Harper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">appeared to double Spinebuster him through a table</a> Ambrose was never seen again, leaving people (his fellow Shield members included) to ask this question.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: Four candidates.<ul><li> The night after defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a> at Extreme Rules, the Shield issued a challenge for a rematch just to prove the first victory wasn't a fluke.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily">The Wyatt Family</a> also has a case.
