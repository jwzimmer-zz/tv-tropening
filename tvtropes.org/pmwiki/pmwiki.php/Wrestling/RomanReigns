This particular part of the angle was quickly abandoned, as Reigns was understandably uncomfortable with it.</li><li> A second feud with Seth Rollins was also cut short. Reigns earned a title shot against World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins at Survivor Series 2015. Unfortunately Rollins got injured and had to relinquish his title.</li><li> His leukemia recurrence ended his feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman">Braun Strowman</a> and the larger feud of the Shield vs. Strowman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewMcIntyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewMcIntyre">Drew McIntyre</a>.

Brock's sheer level of brutality has gotten the better of him each time.

It seems the primary locus of the Authority feud post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> has essentially come down to him vs. Triple H, with the stable's erstwhile centerpieces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> serving as Triple H's proxies. First Triple H did many things to slowly piss Reigns off even as far back as the Shield run, between having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> bring the then-dysfunctional Shield back in line by any means necessary including beating them up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">New Age Outlaws</a> when they wouldn't stay off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily">The Wyatt Family</a> (more on that below), and then trying to have them take out Daniel Bryan and cost him the title after the fact like it was still <em>SummerSlam 2013</em>. This resulted in Reigns spearing Triple H to cement the Shield's face turn and directing pointed Twitter comments about kings and soldiers towards Triple H during the ensuing Shield vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a> feud. Following Triple H's Plan B, causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> to betray him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>, he left the matter of Rollins' due receipts on Ambrose's plate while focusing on physically showing up Randy Orton for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a> he really was &#151; until Orton was no longer part of the Authority. Then they were fine. Meanwhile, Triple H and his cronies kept on pushing his buttons &#151; helping Rollins win the briefcase that screwed him out of his <em>WrestleMania</em> moment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">all the crap they put Dean through</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rcgw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1rcgw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rcgw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not the least of which was taking him out with a cinder block curb stomp (which made Reigns redirect his attention to Rollins briefly, before an injury took him down) and screwing him out of the title against Rollins on a technicality</span> then letting the bros think they were fighting for a clean and fair shot to walk out as the champ after Rollins got hurt only to pull the same shenanigans as before with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a>. Reigns eventually couldn't take it anymore and all but <em>destroyed</em> Triple H, leaving him lying in a hospital bed, only for Triple H to decide to get rid of the proxies, enter in the <em>Royal Rumble</em> as the #30 in which Reigns was forced by the McMahons to enter as the #1 to defend the title, and eliminate him and win the title. At this point, Triple H and he might very well become enemies for life &#151; even Wyatt didn't piss him off this much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a>. Another feud that goes back to the Shield days. The Wyatt Family and The Shield first butted heads in fall 2013, but avoided coming to blows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">due to having common enemies</a>. The same wasn't true in early 2014 when the Wyatts cost the Shield a chance to enter a WWE title match at the Elimination Chamber by interfering and attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> &#151; which set up both Bray's feud with Cena and the interceding Wyatt Family vs. Shield six-man tag team wars of awesome over the next few months. Although the Wyatts served as a test for the psyche of the Shield as a whole, it was clear even then that Reigns was the primary focus of Bray's interest among the Hounds of Justice. In the year's time following the breakup of the two stables, Bray picked feuds with Ambrose as well as Reigns. While he was malicious and scathing towards Dean, he was far more so towards Roman &#151; Reigns was the one Wyatt continuously insisted he'd allow anyone but to succeed, the one whose daughter he implicitly threatened at one point, and the one he reconvened the Wyatt Family against. The latter fact caused Roman and Dean to realign once again and pick up random third partners to take the Family on, including the aforementioned Orton and even accepting what they thought would be Seth Rollins' help for one night because they were such a problem. When it came down to it, the true conflict is between Reigns and Wyatt, and the hatred only seemed to grow week by week. It eventually culminated in a Hell in a Cell match, because the two hated each other that much. And even moving forward, Bray was quick to promise that he and Roman would lock horns again, and he openly endorsed the McMahons' quest to deprive Reigns of the title.</li><li> He is at war with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman">Braun Strowman</a> since the beginning of 2017. Notably, Reigns ended Strowman's undefeated streak in single runs at Fastlane 2017 and both had interfered in each other Universal Championship matches. The two have literally tried to kill each other, and that's not hyperbole. Braun launched Roman off of a loading dock while Roman was still strapped to a stretcher and then tipped over the ambulance Reigns was loaded into. Weeks later, Reigns responded by forcing Strowman into an ambulance and then backing the ambulance into a semi-truck at full speed.</li><li> Following his return from battling cancer and his moving from Raw to SmackDown Live, the first big personal feud he got into was with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a> after Shane took issue with Roman Superman Punching his father Vince, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Elias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Elias">Elias</a> getting involved on Shane's side in retaliation for Roman upstaging him on the same occasion. As of July 2019 the feud is ongoing, but while Roman's opinion of Shane is in no danger of going up, he has developed a conjoined mutual hatred and rivalry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewMcIntyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewMcIntyre">Drew McIntyre</a>, now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to Shane, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonalWithTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonalWithTheDragon">even more intense and personal than his rivalry with Shane</a> due to Drew helping Shane win matches and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeButton">dragging Roman's kids into it</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BaronCorbin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BaronCorbin">Baron Corbin</a> in late 2019 the feud was started when Corbin mocks Reigns's 'Big Dog' nickname.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUsos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUsos">Jey Uso</a> after he became the number one contender for the Universal Championship.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a>: He loved the idea that he could be (and, to this point, is) the one to retire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, and refused to listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>'s advice about the match prior to <em>WrestleMania</em>.

On <em>Monday Night Raw</em> he stands in the ring for the better part of a <em>quarter of an hour</em>, stoically enduring a carpet bombing of vitriolic chants from the assembled crowd.

A big, strong, long-haired guy in black who comes across as an ice-cold badass who can beat up anyone and gets a <em>monster</em> push when Vince decides to make him his pet project (in fact, this became known as receiving the "Diesel Push"). And while Diesel became the then-WWF's lowest-drawing champion ever in 1995, Roman has become one of the most polarizing figures in professional wrestling, with his fair share of fans but absolutely <em>despised</em> by a very large part of the IWC as his push continues. Also, both of them absolutely <em>sucked</em> when forced to present a bland, smiling, white-meat babyface character.

After a five-month hiatus, Reigns not only allied with his long time rival, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a>, he also emulated what Seth Rollins did to him five years earlier by entering the championship match late, after the other two competitors had already destroyed each other, thus winning back the championship he never lost.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">History Repeats</a>:<ul><li> Reigns's career mirrors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">his cousin's</a> a lot in the sense that Vince is trying to get him over as close to a goody-two-shoes face character that you can get in this day and age, only to be utterly rejected by fans (though Reigns is more divisive since, no matter how much the fans hate his character, they agree he can at least pull out a decent match).

The suspension also led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> finally becoming a permanent main eventer (which is also rather fitting, as Ambrose is &mdash; ironically &mdash; the only member of the Shield to not embarrass the company in some fashion).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>: How he lost at <em>Great Balls of Fire</em>.

Before said match, Rusev attacked him from behind and left one of his arms dinged. Despite the minor injury, Roman still decided to fight in the match. And in said match, he took an assortment of beatings that was draining <strong>THE</strong> life out of him. From more than one chairless headshots (ironically still half-nearing the number of steel chair headshots Mick Foley got from The Rock), kicks to the back (most likely the spine), risking getting his other arm damaged by the steel steeps. And Reigns managed to kick out like a mere six times, despite all the varied beatings. More than once (with a bad arm), he slipped out of Rusev's sleeper hold.

Neither thing has been proved thus far; Reigns is actually quite calm and collected for a wrestler (apart from that "screaming at the sky" thing), and has continued to decimate opponents without Rollins. Even when he's furiously beating away at a hated enemy he focuses on the beating rather than wasting time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">Chewing the Scenery</a> or falling into psychosis.

Vince had been criticised for a long time for being willing to sacrifice effectively <em>every guy</em> in his company if it would help get Roman over, yet after Roman was gone the rug got pulled completely out from under him, with almost no stars remaining with the established credibility to take Roman's place. In the end, they wound up giving the belt to Seth Rollins.</li></ul></li><li> In the following weeks before <em>SummerSlam 2019</em>, Reigns has been targeted and attacked by a mysterious assailant, first by a forklift, and later by an attempted car crash (though he was unharmed in both cases), resulting in Samoa Joe becoming increasingly concerned over his safety.</li><li> August 28, 2020: Following his surprise return after five months at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a></em> the previous weekend, (which was Wham enough in itself) Roman is signing the contract for a Universal Championship match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman">Braun Strowman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">The Fiend</a>... and to the shock of nearly <em>everyone</em>, he didn't come alone: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's now <strong>a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a> guy.</strong></span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: October 22, 2018, in which he makes a stadium drop into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence">Stunned Silence</a>.<div class="indent"><strong>Reigns:</strong> My real name is Joe, and I have been living with leukemia for eleven years.
