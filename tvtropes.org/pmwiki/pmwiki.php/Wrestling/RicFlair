Rogers bore a resemblance to Johnny Weissmuller who played Tarzan in the films at that time. Long story short, Pfefer heard the song "Nature Boy" on the radio in the late 1940's, liked the name and gave it to Buddy Rogers.

He turned on Vader, Mr. Perfect, Randy Orton, Batista, and even alienated fellow Horsemen Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko with his David-centric behavior. Perhaps the most triumphant example of this trope, though, was during the 1992 Royal Rumble, when he gave The Barbarian a high-five, circled around in front of him and immediately gave him a knife-edge chop. Raised to funny by commentator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyHeenan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyHeenan">Bobby Heenan</a>, who had previously managed Barbarian, pleading with Ric not to turn on Barbarian.<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Scott Steiner</a>:</strong> Mean, WOO, Gene!

With rappers, most of the stuff they wear is rented for the videos. Over half of Flair's career was spent in the days of kayfabe being unbroken. At the very height of his career in the late 80s, he spent over $60,000 a year of his own money on limousines alone for himself and the Four Horsemen. He probably has spent more money on spilt liquor in bars from one side of this world to the other, than most people make in a year. He's also run into financial problems at times due to still living the Nature Boy lifestyle without the Nature Boy paycheck. According to his stepson on <em>Celebrity Wife Swap</em>, you would need a six-figure salary to pay for the nightly cost of Ric's restaurant bills. That's right, a pre-teen with a legal pad is a better accountant than Mr. Flair. (Between leaving WWE for the second time and joining TNA, he started a financial advice company. This is not a joke. It actually existed: Ric Flair Finance. It went bust, unsurprisingly.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Consummate Liar</a>: One of the most infamous running gags in all of wrestling is how Flair's natural charisma would start to win over Sting's trust before Flair would, of course, screw Sting over in some dastardly way.

After he broke his back at age 26, he started working a much safer style; one would imagine it helped keep him much lower on the concussion count than many of his peers. It's hard to remember (what with his leaps from the top rope always failing), but one of Flair's quirks when he was NWA Champion was to flip over the top rope to the apron after being Irish Whipped. In some ways he displayed more agility when he was older, namely by adding a roll to his jumping knee drop after connecting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">Defiant to the End</a>: Ric's final <em>WrestleMania</em> match. Facing a mandate that he would be fired the next time he lost, Ric specifically chose to face Shawn Michaels, Mr. WrestleMania, because if he didn't face the best then it didn't mean anything. At the end of the match, Flair (legitimately, if tales are to be believed) had trouble even standing and holding his fists up, telling Shawn to "Come on! Pull the trigger!" He knew it was his last match, and it would end in nothing short of an epic climax.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a>:<ul><li> Due to playing the "ladykiller" gimmick well into his sixties he comes across as this.

On the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PlaneRideFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PlaneRideFromHell">Plane Ride from Hell</a>, Ric Flair drunkenly stumbled around in nothing but his robe, WOO-ing at stewardesses.

Not only was the WCW title up for grabs, but so was "ownership" of WCW, which Flair had won for 90 days by beating Eric earlier that year. (It was okay because Flair was a good guy.) In the weeks that followed, Flair did the thing where he stripped to his underoos in the middle of the ring. He had gone mad with power. He would later become just as bad as Eric, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanMalenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanMalenko">Dean Malenko</a> had to play the voice of reason.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: He debuted in 1972 as "Ramblin' Ricky Rhodes", a 300-pound brawler billed as Dusty Rhodes' cousin.

Flair was their Cena; a significant amount of WCW viewers, particularly the Carolinas and surrounding region, mostly watched for Flair. He remained with them until the company shuttered its doors in 2001.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFault">Face Fault</a>: The "Flair Flop", in which Flair would get hit a few times, stagger forward, then fall flat on his face while his legs went back and up in the air a bit. The joke being, one minute he's the toughest son of a bitch in the room, and the next he's flopping around like a fish. As time went on his opponents would often back off to watch the inevitable flop. Some would even visibly geek out over the spectacle! Whenever you play as Ric Flair in the WWE games, one of your "taunts" is the flop which puts you at a disadvantage. He's even Flair Flopped onto a board covered in barbed wire. As compiled <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/XNfDSnX2mDw">by WWE itself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it can sometimes be prompted by a kiss rather than a punch.

That VERY NEXT DAY after Vince kills the InVasion angle (which effectively shut the book on WCW), Ric Flair debuts as co-owner and puts an arm around him, and Vince looks horrified. Very funny and also bittersweet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist">The Fighting Narcissist</a>: The original Narcissist of wrestling might have been "Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers, which, at the time was not so much its own gimmick as it was a subversion of the original Gorgeous George, real name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GeorgeWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GeorgeWagner">George Wagner</a>. Buddy looked and acted similarly, but instead of any suggestions toward homosexuality, he outraged audiences with his obliviously inflated ego, such as his insistence his bleached head was naturally that way. 30 years later, Rogers was succeeded by a rubber-faced blond who dressed like Elton John, but added on claims of having a ludicrous fortune and lady-killing record, paying tribute to both Gorgeous George and the more recent narcissist gimmick.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>: Well, he was a heel and it was the 70's and 80's. Every match would end in bullshit heel antics, DQ's, countouts, literally just holding someone down after a double leg takedown for a pin was common. It was a different time where you didn't really need to use the same move to finish every match. That said, the Figure Four Leglock was the signature Flair spot he often won with. He beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> with the figure four at <em>Summerslam</em> '02 and Vince McMahon at the '02 Royal Rumble. That may have been the most effective year in the history of the figure four. Jericho actually says in his book that he had to convince Flair to allow him to tap out to the move. (To be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> rarely beat anyone with it either. So, the legacy lives on.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>:<ul><li> It's hard to deny that Flair's later promos are really bizarre. They are awesome, but also what the heck is he doing and how can a human body contain that much cocaine.</li><li> The Figure Four. He did beat lots of people with it back in the day, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">jobbers</a> during the buildup to a feud with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">babyface</a>. They had to establish that the Figure Four was a death sentence, so that it was a big deal when the champ finally reversed it. (When he beat a name opponent with the Figure Four it was usually by pinfall, after they'd been KO'd by chicanery. Or, as in the case of Randy Savage when Flair beat him for the WWE Title in September 1992, "passed out" from the "pain".) As time goes on, though, any wrestling move starts to get taken for granted, and stops being impressive on its own. Especially after enough babyfaces counter it for the big win. So after a while, the Figure 4 went from "<em>OMG he just broke that guy's leg</em>" to basically a rest hold which started being countered all the time. Ric says the same on just about every podcast, uncertain why anyone would use the move, since he can't remember winning a single match with the Figure Four himself.</li><li> 1998 was the year he was being booked by Hogan and Nash: a dementia-ridden grandpa who just says whatever he wants, and it's funny at first, but at the same time you kinda wanna help him.

At WCW Fall Brawl 97 on September 14, the nWo (Kevin Nash/Syxx/Buff Bagwell/Konnan) defeated the Horsemen (Flair/Hennig/Chris Benoit/Steve "Mongo" McMichael) in <em>War Games</em> when Mongo submitted after Hennig had turned heel, handcuffed Benoit and Mongo to the cage and finished the job by literally slamming the cage door on Flair's head. What makes this utterly blind judgment is that Hennig had already proven two months earlier that he couldn't be trusted when he turned on Diamond Dallas Page in their match against nWo members Scott Hall and Randy Savage at Bash at the Beach. On top of that, earlier at Fall Brawl, the nWo had attacked Hennig, and he had shown up for the match with a cast on his arm. This was a recycling of the angle from the October 21, 1996 Raw, where Triple H (one of Hall and Nash's Kliq partners!) had "injured" Mr. Perfect prior to what was supposed to be Perfect's return to the ring after a three-year absence, leading to Perfect essentially suckering in WWE Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion "Wildman" Marc Mero into defending his title, since Helmsley had said that he wouldn't wrestle Mero unless the title was on the line.

A lifelong fan of the Nature Boy, Robinson's career is closely intertwined with the family, making him something of an honorary Flair. He was first introduced as the Horsemen's "crooked referee", and even wrestled under a gimmick where he WAS a Mini-Me of Ric Flair. That's because he makes a far more <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLs7fBGDz4">convincing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Heir to Flair than any of Ric's sons. This was very evident back in '98, when Robinson was calling David Flair's matches. Later, when Flair was carried out on a stretcher following the incident with the crowbar (DDP reversed it on him), David pretended to cry, but Robinson was WEEPING. Because he is great. (It's also funny for a different reason: the older Flair gets, the more noticeable it is that Robinson doesn't age. Dude's a robot.) He dropped the Heel Ref angle once he joined up with WWE. He could also be seen officiating Charlotte's title match in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">NXT</a></em>, and appropriately enough was the referee for Flair's last WWE match at <em>WrestleMania</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor">Inadequate Inheritor</a>:<ul><li> Flair as the eccentric mentor/soccer mom is great, as long as they don't have them pull an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> and try to make his pupil look/behave like Flair. (His robe came with a hood, you see.)</li><li> There's the "Real" Nature Boy Buddy Landel. His claim to fame is being drafted by Shane Douglas to be his training dummy. (Ric Flair once said he would lend him a robe but that Buddy would get lost in the arms.) It was even parodied by the late "Playboy" Buddy Rose, whose big Buddha belly and silk robes were part of his gimmick. (In fact, when Flair would boast of some "blonde waiting for him" in a limousine, Hogan and Nash would chirp, "Buddy Rose?") And who can forget Paul Lee, an indie wrestler who paid a cash-strapped Flair to endorse him, and then claimed they went back years together?</li><li> Since his earliest days in the NWA, Lex Luger was seen as the heir to Flair&#146;s throne. He was actually an honorary member of the Horsemen for a year. Flair thought differently; he believed that Sting most deserved to be champion. (Note that Sting didn't even win their title match, it was a draw.)</li><li> In the 90s, the Flair kids made a one-shot appearance on Nitro. It moved the needle, so the company decided to hire David on full-time. But WCW being WCW, they never bothered to send him to the Power Plant (their training facility) in Georgia, they just threw a shag robe on him and blared <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlsoSprachZarathustra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlsoSprachZarathustra">Also sprach Zarathustra</a></em>. At the Georgia Dome in July 1999, they literally handed the U.S. Title to David Flair, still so untrained that he couldn't even run the ropes yet. (It's like when they add a new child to a family sitcom to spice things up. Beginning of the end.) His incompetence became a joke, with even Ric expressing "disappointment" in him in kayfabe. David in the WCW Hardcore division was alright: his team-up with Crowbar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> sucky guys taking beatings for our amusement) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaffneyUnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaffneyUnger">Daffney</a> was a highlight of the crumbling WCW. David was awful, but he was honestly presented as awful.</li><li> The random passing of the Figure Four from Flair... to The Miz.

Don't forget that Ric also pitched himself as Cesaro's manager.</li><li> With Landel and Rose now gone, it seems Ric Flair is... the last surviving Nature Boy? Seems fitting. And oddly surprising.

The full story here is that Flair, like every NWA champion, had put down a $25,000 deposit on the belt. Since he kept winning, his deposit was never returned. When he was fired/resigned from WCW (without having been made to drop the title), the deposit was never returned, so Ric kept the belt and took it with him to WWE. WCW filed a lawsuit which led to the censoring of the belt and Ric at first wearing a belt that resembled one of the tag titles, then a "Big Gold" knockoff. In the end, WWF simply put their own world title on him. WCW later reacquired the belt from Flair for a hefty $38,000.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerScam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerScam">Massive Multiplayer Scam</a>: Let's just say it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">the Perfect Plan</a>.

The crowd sat on its hands effectively no-selling the entire undercard, resulting in just about everyone half-assing their matches, before launching into the deafening "We want Flair!" chants practically non-stop during the Lex Luger vs. Barry Windham main event; the chants were loud enough to be heard despite WCW cutting the crowd microphones; they were even picked up on the ring and announcer mics. And all this when Flair had been the most hated heel in the company going into the pay-per-view!

Despite many accomplishments in WWE and his stated intention to close out his career there, Flair's contract finally expired in 2009 (apparently he was a little too animated for today's scripted WWE) and he migrated to TNA; but within a year he'd had a bellyful and returned to WWE, fulfilling his wish.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink">Real Men Wear Pink</a>: He wore a brand-new, sparkly, befeathered, occasionally-pink ring robe to each big event (we're talking pink, here; he should've driven to the ring in a Barbie Dream Car). Each robe was custom-made and cost more than the previous one, eventually totaling at $5000 a pop&mdash;and yet he still manages to look masculine. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/il256La.jpg">Here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> is the famous photo of Sherri trying one on of his robes.

He was a 16-Time World Champion and had an in-ring career spanning nearly 50 years. Some of the companies he headlined in don't even exist anymore.<ul><li> <strong>AWA</strong>: Trained by Verne Gagne, Flair debuted in the AWA in December of 1971.</li><li> <strong>NWA</strong>: From its founding in 1948 until 2019, the NWA wasn't a promotion, but instead a loose alliance of promoters who agreed to a set of bylaws and shared a common world heavyweight "championship". By the late 80's it was pretty centralized around Jim Crockett, though, which is what led to Jim Crockett Promotions becoming WCW. (Fun fact: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> and TNA didn't come from nowhere; they used to be a part of the NWA as well. And when Flair first joined the NWA, WWE was part of it too.) Flair left for the NWA in 1974. He won the NWA Championship 9 times in that span, an unbeatable record.</li><li> <strong>WWE</strong>: During his two years in the WWF, Flair beat Sid Justice to win the vacant World Championship title. In the remaining years at WCW, Ric was the WCW Champion 8 times (bringing the grand total to 9 WCW reigns) before the company was bought by WWE. Flair returned to wrestling in November of 2001 in WWE and continued to work there up until his first retirement in 2008 in a grandiose career match vs. Shawn Michaels.</li><li> <strong>TNA</strong>: After his first retirement, Ric Flair eventually went to work to TNA for two years. In that run, he helped AJ Styles retain the TNA Championship. He continued to wrestle part-time for TNA and other indie promotions until officially announcing his retirement at 63, almost exactly forty years after his debut. After Ric returned to WWE in a non-wrestling role, he was in his daughter's corner when she first won the Divas Championship, them the NXT Women's Championship, and finally the World Women's Championship at WrestleMania 32.</li><li> Of course all of this wouldn't be counting Japan or any other territories. It's funny because Flair probably does have over 100 reigns. When Flair wasn't in a big money feud, he'd go to crappy little territory shows, drop the belt to a local hero on Friday, and win it back on Sunday. The NWA didn't count any of them, so who knows how many times Flair actually won the title. Can we get Scott Steiner in here to check the math?</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a>: Of a sports variety. His classic rivalry with Dusty Rhodes was designed to mirror the Lakers-Celtics rivalry that was huge at the time, pitting the flashy, stylish and flamboyant (Flair/Lakers) against the no-nonsense, workmanlike, determined style (Rhodes/Celtics). As history can tell, it achieved massive success for both the NWA and the NBA.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a>:<ul><li> Quite a few, but his most memorable opponents were Dusty Rhodes (the common man to his "Golden Spoon"), Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, Sting, Lex Luger, Mick Foley, and, of course, Hulk Hogan. Flair sparked the little "war" between himself and Foley by taking a potshot at garbage wrestlers; Mick let him have it in his bestselling book, <em>The Hardcore Diaries</em>. This went back and forth for a while, and they are now friends.</li><li> Flair loved him some authority feuds. He gave Vince McMahon a legitimate black eye, and defeated Bischoff and shaved his head on-camera to win the job of WCW President (after being sent to an asylum). The pair reunited on Impact as the heads of Immortal and Fortune, and time had not healed all wounds.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>'s mainstay champion was Shane Douglas, a man who, for no discernible reason, publicly blasted Flair every chance he got. (Shane claims that one time he asked Ric what he thought of his match, and Ric said "keep doing what you're doing", and it turned out Ric hadn't actually watched the match).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>: Okay, those chops really do hurt but why bother when you can just punch a guy instead? <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4nvi2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4nvi2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4nvi2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Because punching is actually illegal in wrestling, and back in the days when Flair broke in, you would actually be disqualified if you didn't watch the "knuckle blows" Hence throwing chops, forearms and elbows. In many older matches you can actually see the ref smack at a wrestlers hand if he clenches his fist.</span> Because the chop makes a louder noise, WOOO! To that matter, why keep using the figure four leglock when it has an obvious counter and only won you one of your sixteen titles?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5e3bw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5e3bw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5e3bw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As noted above, Randy Savage "passed out" while "trapped" in the hold when Flair challenged him for the WWE title in September 1992.</span> Because it looks cool, WOOO!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a>: He wasn't given the nickname "The Dirtiest Player in the Game" for nothing. Thumbs to the eye and kicks to the groin were among his favorite illegal tactics. Flair would also use chop blocks, kicks, ANYTHING that would weaken an opponent's legs and/or knees to soften them up for the Figure Four. He so thoroughly owns the knife-edge chop that if anyone uses it today, the crowd will shout "Wooo!" in honor of Ric.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a>: You have to remember that there's Ric Flair and there's Richard Fliehr. Richard has a reputation for leaving promoters high and dry with money, be it ROH, Highspots, or countless other autograph/collectibles companies across the country. He was stupidly irresponsible with money, and now finds himself in a pile of debt which will likely just be transferred over to his estate when he dies. (Not to mention having to pay alimony to alllllllll his ex-wives...) To his credit, he's owned up to it and even incorporated it into his schtick.<div class="indent"><strong>Flair:</strong> Will Woo For Food.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Spell My Catchphrase Without an "H"</a>: His catchphrase is often misspelled as "Whooooo!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVsSnobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVsSnobs">Slobs vs. Snobs</a>: Ric and Dusty had a great feud which defined their characters, right down to their purported favorite Basketball teams. Ric (dropping the "K" from his name, a chic and stylish spelling) represents the high life many wish they could live. Ric is a fan of the LA Lakers. The Lakers were (and still are) the team of the beautiful people, with players named "Magic" and A-List celebrities attending each game. On to Dusty Rhodes, the son of a plumber and the American Dream. Dusty is the common working man who knows "hard times". Even his name conjures images of the dust bowl from The Grapes of Wraith. And whose jacket did he wear? The Boston Celtics, the Lakers' perennial championship archrivals of the time whose star was nicknamed the "Hick from French Lick". Flair would even cite this in a promo as a reason why he hated Rhodes. And since the majority of their feud was in the 80's, it provided a great mirror of Wall Street vs. Main Street with the rise of yuppie culture.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a>: His signature top-rope spot (where he climbs up only to get tossed off).

By far his most famous guest was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FredOttman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FredOttman">Shockmaster</a>. Ric, on the verge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing">corpsing</a>, fled the set.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheatricsOfPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheatricsOfPain">Theatrics of Pain</a>: If he wanted you to believe he was in pain, he would make you believe it. Flair could probably out-sell Redd Foxx's heart attacks. He even has a specific move named after him: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePlant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePlant">The Flair Flop</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>: During his first and only visit to Memphis Studios Flair claimed to not know who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> was. Lawler pointed out they had already wrestled in Florida.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: Him and Arn Anderson. Both men demonstrated this trope 2002 season of RAW when The Undertaker intentionally assaulted Double A to make Ric Flair "change his mind" about facing him in that year's WrestleMania. Then, Ric Flair attacks The Undertaker with a large pipe while making it clear he's still not accepting the eventual WrestleMania and warning him if he ever goes after one of his friends, especially Double A, he'll show him why he's the " the dirtiest player in the game". As for Double A, he told Ric Flair don't accept the match because of him while also stating he didn't want his career/or legacy to come crashing down because of "The Deadman".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TuxedoAndMartini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TuxedoAndMartini">Tuxedo and Martini</a>: Late-phase WCW Flair wore tuxedos to the ring.

And yet, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">what we know about his persona</a>, it's every bit as in character.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe">Unlimited Wardrobe</a>: Flair's ring attire is legendary; elaborate robe, usually with feathers, fur, and/or jewels, trunks, and boots typically the same color as his robe with "RF" monogrammed on them in a custom font, and kneepads. The hand-made robes were top of the line, costing several thousand dollars minimum. Out of the ring, Flair was committed to the gimmick of being the Nature Boy. He wore tailored suits, handmade shoes, custom sunglasses, rings and stupidly-expensive watches (like the matching Rolexes he and Shawn Michaels bought to commemorate his last WWE match). And apparently, some damn expensive shoes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrelatedBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrelatedBrothers">Unrelated Brothers</a>: He originally introduced in the NWA as the "nephew" of veteran wrestler Rip Hawk, and later as a distant cousin of the Anderson wrestling family, which also consisted entirely of unrelated relatives. The cousin aspect was eventually dropped as Flair became closely associated with Ole and Arn Anderson. He also spent time in 1972 as Ramblin' Ricky Rhodes, a cousin of Dusty Rhodes. When that didn't work, he became Ric Flair, the wealthier cousin of Arn Anderson and leader of The Four Horsemen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>: Of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> as perennial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">Heel</a> champion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution">Vocal Evolution</a>: He has always had a lisp, but it has become more pronounced over the last few years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a>: Exploited, as Flair would famously lure Sting (aka "the dumbest man in wrestling") into the Four Horsemen and then turn on him, kicking him out of the group. And he did it twice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily">Wrestling Family</a>:<ul><li> His eldest son, David, is known for his time in WCW from 1999 until the end. David would have been fine if they had actually, well, trained him. To make matters worse, he had the charisma of a grape. In fairness, he never really wanted to be a pro wrestler full time; he was a career police officer and trained in his off time at WCW's Power Plant training facility as more of a hobby than anything else, because it was fun and it gave him and his dad something to talk about. All of a sudden, though, WCW wanted to throw big money at him to get in the ring in televised angles and feuds and hell, who would say no to that? And the common consensus was his time with Crowbar and Daffney did make for some of WCW's more genuinely funny moments, so it could be argued that it wasn't all bad. After WCW closed its doors, he spent some time bouncing around WWE, TNA, and a handful of NWA territories, all the while never making any pretense that he was anything other than an enthusiastic hobbyist, before calling it quits in 2008.</li><li> Flair's younger son, Reid, competed primarily in the North Carolina area and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> before dying on March 29, 2013, of what has since been determined to have been an accidental overdose of heroin and other drugs. Flair was also near obsessed with the kid. He would never stop talking about his achievements and how'd be a big star. He did have the talent, though. Reid was a <em>transcendent</em> talent at amateur wrestling, having won several tournaments at the state level and another at nationals <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09dzz');"><sup>trivia&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note09dzz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09dzz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, it was this national tournament that Ric Flair referred to in his biography that caused so much bad blood between himself at Eric Bischoff in WCW. Ric had given what he felt was more than enough advance notice that he would be unavailable while attending his son's matches, but was told to show up to a TV taping only a couple days before the set date, and which point he told them no, I made my plans months ago, suck it up. Probably with much more yelling. Bischoff then directly referenced the incident in a later talent meeting when he berated Flair publicly in front of much of the WCW roster for his perceived unprofessionalism.</span> and could have made some noise at the Olympic level if so inclined and had kept on course. But after high school, he began getting into trouble with drugs, in fact being denied a WWE developmental deal because he couldn't pass a drug screening, which set the tone for his last few years. He felt bad for not being there for his other kids, but Reid was the one he was going to get right. If Ric could be faulted for anything, though, it was taking things too far in the other direction, being overaccommodating to compensate for his absence and being more a friend than a father. WWE, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">showing their knack for sensitivity</a>, thought it would be a good idea to make light of Reid's death, to get everyone talking about the Paige/Charlotte feud by inserting a line in a promo having Paige mock Reid's death to his sister's face <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1uomn');"><sup>text&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1uomn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1uomn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Your baby brother, he didn't have much fight in him, did he?"</span>&#151;without asking him, of course. (It's easier to ask forgiveness than ask for permission.)</li><li> Flair's daughter Ashley (now billed as Charlotte Flair) is a former NXT Women's Champion and WWE Divas Champion, as well as a four-time WWE Raw Women's Champion. (Note that the <em>Raw</em> Women's Championship is actually <em>the</em> WWE Women's Championship: the 2016 brand split took place during her first reign. During her second reign, the title was rechristened the Raw Women's Championship after the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown</a></em> Women's Championship was created.) She turned out to be the second-generation Flair who made it in this business.</li><li> Scott McGhee is his brother-in-law and Bram, perhaps best known to USA viewers for his time in TNA, was his son-in-law, having been previously married to Charlotte.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>:<ul><li> Ric Flair looks great for 71. His appearance has always confused people: when you go and watch his pre-2000 work, it's surprising by how young he looks. A life of touring, partying and getting dropped on the head for a living took its toll.</li><li> Fans are always amazed at how much older he appears in the 2010s compared to, say, the late 90s or the turn of the millennium. What they don't typically notice is that he looks amazing for a man well into his late forties and early fifties and only during his mid-to-late fifties had age caught up with him more or less all at once.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"><em>[stagger] <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNfDSnX2mDw">[faceplant<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>]</em></div></dd></dl><hr>
