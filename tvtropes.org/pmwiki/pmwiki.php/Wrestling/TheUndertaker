Hell, during his heyday back in the late '90s, the man was unbeatable, and he was capable of going toe-to-toe with just about every wrestler and style out there.<ul><li> As further proof, he was still putting on matches that are rightly regarded as instant classics <em>well into his 40s</em>.

Not from the first fall, but upon seeing Foley climb off the stretcher, smiling, and running to the cage to climb back up. It's not shown during the match itself for more than a half a second on the King of the Ring 1998 VHS tape and DVD, but some video (such as <em>Eve of Destruction</em>) shows Taker is legitimately shocked. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> can be interpreted as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> that Mankind wants more, astonishment that he was able to get up or a real life concern of what else can happen.<ul><li> He <em>definitely</em> had another real one shortly afterwards, when he chokeslammed Mankind onto the top of the cage, only for the cage to give way and for Mick Foley to plummet to the mat on his back (with a steel chair following him down to land on his face). It's minor, but you can see Undertaker recoil in shock as the wire panel collapses under Mankind's body. Taker would later admit that at that moment he genuinely thought he'd killed Foley.</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps his first inversion was during Giant Gonzalez's debut &mdash; he was clearly not used to someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller">One Head Taller</a>.

First was a wordless one after 'Taker's return <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">(which was surprising on its own)</a>, when Hunter patted him on the shoulder to signify the refusal of his challenge. Then came Hunter finally giving in and setting the match... in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell">Hell in a Cell</a>. Then after that, it was the reveal of Shawn Michaels as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">guest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">referee</a>. Let's just say they went overboard trying to make up for the buildup <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">(or lack thereof)</a> for their match last year.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then there's from his 2018 brief comeback, no less!</span><div class="indent"><strong>The Undertaker:</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I declare for all of those who have fallen, it is truly time... you rest... in... peace!!</span></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatExactlyIsHisJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatExactlyIsHisJob">What, Exactly, Is His Job?</a>: After Taker's return at <em>Judgment Day 2000</em> to kick off the Bikertaker gimmick, he often wore shirts that had the words "Deadman Inc." on them. It was never explained what "Deadman Inc." was supposed to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: His 2013 run ended with him going up against one of the members of The Shield, Dean Ambrose, to avenge his brother, Kane. Although he <em>did</em> win the match (handing them their first loss) the group subsequently ganged up on him and put him through a table. He wasn't seen for the rest of the year.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Quite literally in this case. After Undertaker defeated Edge at <em>SummerSlam 2008</em> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell">Hell in a Cell</a> match, he pushed Edge off the top of a ladder <em>through the mat</em> - and the hole soon had flames coming up from it, symbolic of Undertaker sending Edge to be swallowed up by "the fires of Hell". Why had he done this? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Because Edge had almost gotten him banned from WWE for life.</a><ul><li> There's also Undertaker's decision to bury Paul Bearer in cement in 2004, presumably because Bearer was "a weakness". This is probably why Bearer betrayed Undertaker and sided with Kane when he came back in 2010.</li><li> This trope may have benefited The Undertaker's character, as the Deadman is generally understood to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">dark hero</a> version at best of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a>. Thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">moments where he steps into his evil side like that help the credibility of the character's fearsomeness.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWontYouDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWontYouDie">Why Won't You Die?</a>: Undertaker's opponents generally react in this way to his superhuman durability at WrestleMania, especially since WrestleMania XXVII, when (and this is probably an understatement) Triple H handed Undertaker his ass for nearly the entire match. Three Pedigrees. A chair to the skull. Spinebuster through the announce table. Triple H even used Undertaker's <em>own Tombstone Piledriver</em> at one point. Undertaker kicked out every single time, and eventually, Triple H was so taken aback that he looked absolutely terrified, like he'd seen a ghost... even though Undertaker was prone on the mat and looked like a strong breeze might kill him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>: One of the most iconic tweeners in the business. It doesn't matter whether he's a heel or a face, the crowd love him, and he'll fight whoever he wants to fight. His only relatively consistent loyalties are to Paul Bearer and Kane, and prior to Bearer's death those three turned on each other whenever it suited them and were never all on the same page at once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>: with Kane in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">toyed-with</a> fashion. Their relationship is strictly brotherly but over the years had many of the same showings as an off &amp; on Soap Opera relationship.<ul><li> After their first feud in 98, there's some strange interactions between them that hint at collusion such as Taker stopping Austin from counting out Kane, trying to count out Road Dogg when Kane got the pinfall, Kane stopping Mankind from attacking Taker with a chair, and Taker seemingly taking a dive to Kane during the tag-team Champions match with Austin, given he sits right up after the pinfall count.</li><li> During the above back &amp; forth, Taker tombstones Kane during a match to "prove" he's not in cahoots with him, but Vince comes out the following week to explain why Taker's protest examples don't prove anything.</li><li> When Vince &amp; Austin ask Taker if he's involved with Kane, Taker defensively tells them to go to Hell. Later when Vince inquires again, Taker refuses to answer him.</li><li> A big example happens when they finally reveal themselves as a team and Vince comes out to say they "have finally come out of the casket."</li><li> In 99, Kane became friends with X-Pac which Taker hated. Taker begins talking to his brother again, wanting Kane to join him &amp; X-Pac says he wants nothing to do with Kane if he's back with his brother. Taker comes out to tell Kane he'd never ask or make him chose, causing Kane to leave with him. They officially reunite but when Kane went to X-Pac's rescue against Big Show later, Taker went to the ring &amp; glared daggers at his brother, causing the latter to reluctantly leave with him again.</li><li> They basically break-up when Taker brutally choke-slams X-Pac (which Kane doesn't see at first). Kane leaves with Taker, but goes back to check on X-Pac who's unconscious in the ring. Taker follows Kane to the ring to pull him away from X-Pac, tell him it's over &amp; to come on. Kane reluctantly follows until he sees the chokeslam replayed on the tron &amp; returns the gesture, chokeslamming Taker &amp; carrying X-Pac from the ring. X-Pac hugs Kane while Taker glares menacingly at both men. The situation with Kane, along with costing him the Frist Blood match with Austin, makes X-Pac a target which Taker wasted no time <a class="urllink" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/j0qgk3tC0OA2pc3VSP/giphy.gif">getting practice on<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> the following RAW.</li><li> Starting 2000, they clearly weren't close but worked as an effective tag-team until Kane chokeslams Taker after a match. They feud again, leading to a Summerslam match which ends in a DQ when Kane flees the ring after Taker unmasks him. Toward the end of the year &amp; into Jan. of 2001, Taker &amp; Kane have reluctance to fight each other during a 6 man tag-match, when Kane tags w/ Rock to face Taker &amp; Rikishi, he ends up chokeslamming the Rock which causes Taker to get the pin. Taker also shows up to save Kane from Rikishi. All said instances cause JR &amp; King to speculate on the brothers reconciling until it finally comes to light.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>: WWE <em>loves</em> having new guys beat Taker into a pulp to make them look like major threats. It rarely works, mostly due to the fact that that they have a bad tendency to do this with guys that really have little in the way of talent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry">Mark Henry</a>, The Great Khali, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VladimirKozlov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VladimirKozlov">Vladimir Kozlov</a>, etc.) and the fact that Taker is probably the only guy in the company <em>no one</em> wants to see lose, especially once his appearances became sporadic to the point of being a sort of "special occasion". Because of this, most of his Worfings aren't losses. He'll get beat up but once it's time for a real match he'll usually win.<ul><li> The supposedly unbreakable plexiglass seen in structures such as the Elimination Chamber and Michael Cole's "coal mine" have repeatedly proven breakable by the Undertaker.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley. Nobody's <em>ever</em> gotten as close to ending the Streak as Shawn Michaels did at <em>WrestleMania XXV</em> (at least until <em>WrestleMania XXVII</em>, and then <em>WrestleMania XXX</em>), and with Mick Foley, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">it's kinda obvious</a>.</li><li> One could argue this to be the case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> as well, as the two have traded wins and losses and are at 2-2 each. The kicker is that all four matches were championship bouts.</li><li> Brock Lesnar, after ending The Streak, has a very good case. Against Undertaker one-on-one, Lesnar is 4-1-1. The Deadman's only win? 2015's SummerSlam, which was marred by Undertaker TAPPING OUT, and then using a low-blow to get the jump on Brock after Lesnar thought he had won because the bell rang. Lesnar is also the only man to defeat Undertaker inside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell">Hell in a Cell</a> twice, and Brock eliminated Undertaker last in the 2003 Royal Rumble to win the match.</li><li> While subtle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a> earned Taker's respect for a similar reason that Mankind did - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">namely, his willingness to <em>leap from the top of the Cell</em></span> during their WrestleMania match, which Undertaker acknowledged by lightly patting Shane's cheek prior to hitting the Tombstone on him. This was made much more explicit in the run-up to 2016's Survivor Series, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DyCnA8sOG8">when Taker came back to deliver a message to Smackdown's Survivor Series team<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, up to literally tipping his hat to Shane. However, this was later subverted in 2019 after Shane made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> and became, in 'Taker's words, a victim of his own greed and ego; he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">intervened</a> in a handicap match Shane arranged that pitted him and Drew McIntyre against Roman Reigns on Roman's behalf, saying that he could no longer abide Shane's constant abuse of his power, and joined forces with Roman against Shane and McIntyre for a No-Holds-Barred Tag Team match at Extreme Rules.</li><li> Recently at Wrestlemania 36, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AjStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AjStyles">Aj Styles</a> seemed to have earned Taker's respect. Taker says Styles was tougher than he gave him credit for, that he fought his ass off, and that it's not many people who ever gave him that fight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: Kayfabe-wise, he isn't shy about this when he's in Heel or rampage mode. His fight with Chyna shows it when he shoves her by the face and later chokeslamed her. Averted by Mark in real life, and even during the chokeslam, he is notably easier on her than he would be on male wrestlers doing the stunt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily">Wrestling Family</a>: Brian Lee aka Underfaker, Ron and Don Harris are his cousins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingPsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingPsychology">Wrestling Psychology</a>: Well-known for his solid grasp at this, especially during the latter stages of his career, where he'd act less like an unfeeling "zombie" and more of a vulnerable figure. It's part of what earned his two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleManias</a> against Shawn, and later HHH, critical acclaim.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingMonster">Wrestling Monster</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Vader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Vader">Big Van Vader</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLeaveHimAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLeaveHimAlone">You Leave Him Alone!</a>: Has this moment when trying to save Kane from The Two Man Power Trip. Kane was trying to save him but got beaten down by the duo who began trying to break his already hurt arm. Being beaten up plus taking a sledgehammer shot to the head, Taker can only crawl toward Kane while repeatedly yelling "no." After Stone Cold snaps a chair on Kane's hurt arm, Taker can then be heard off-camera screaming "leave him alone!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://i2.wp.com/www.brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Undertaker-New-Photo.jpg?resize=640%2C585">He looks much older than 49 in this image.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul><hr><div class="indent"><em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole">Absolutely bone-chilling.</a>"</em></div>
