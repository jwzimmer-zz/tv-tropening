He began as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackyardWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackyardWrestling">backyard wrestler</a>, who gave up the hobby in 1999 in order to train in the Steel Dominion Wrestling school of Chicago, Illinois under established professional wrestlers Ace Steel, Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn. Punk went on to win Steel Domain Television championship and would then give back to professional wrestling by becoming a trainer himself for Steel Domain and Primetime Wrestling. His work as a trainer got him hired by the ROH Academy, which he became the first head trainer of.</p><p>Between this time, CM Punk spent the years working for various Independent Wrestling Association affiliates (particularly Mid-South), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> territories such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingZero1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingZero1">Pro Wrestling ZERO1</a> and other promotions across the globe - his most notable work being in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">World Wrestling Entertainment</a>. He set himself apart from his coworkers with a "Straight Edge" gimmick, which consisted of him flaunting his (completely legit) Straight Edge lifestyle over other wrestlers, telling them and anyone else who would listen that "I'm better than you!" because of it. This led to him heading a growing faction in WWE called the Straight Edge Society, which promised to "save" people from their self-destructive lifestyles by helping them embrace the principles and beliefs of a Straight Edge lifestyle.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>However his rise to WWE Superstardom came during the year of 2011, during the "Summer of Punk".

After his return and regaining the belt, he held the title for 434 days, becoming the longest reigning WWE Champion of the Modern Era.</p><p>On January 27, 2014, Punk walked out on WWE, supposedly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_78695.shtml#.U5ZPJXbfOt8">as of May 29, 2014, Punk has officially retired from professional wrestling<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, focusing his training on a possible dabbling in mixed martial arts.

Even when they weren't getting kicked in the head or being forced through insane initiation processes, he didn't care about the well being of Nexus. Although it's a little ironic since while he was actually punting them, Punk seemed almost desperate to stop him. Likely an attempt to make Punk actually look like the face in this feud. Granted, he preferred to have minions around to do his dirty work. Now that it's done and they're crippled, he doesn't really give a shit about them any more.</li><li> He's seemingly faced one in John Laurinaitis, whose "efforts" to be spontaneous and unpredictable have been a thorn in Punk's side.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil">Bald of Evil</a>: Punk has hair, but part of joining the Straight Edge Society involves the person's head being shaved. Punk explained the reasoning behind not shaving his own head by saying that his hair was a sign of purity - a sign that he had never let any drugs or illicit substances enter him. At <em>Over the Limit 2010</em>, Punk was shaved bald after losing to Rey Mysterio (per a pre-match stipulation). For weeks, Punk refused to show his bald head and wore a specially-designed SES mask to hide it (he received a legitimate head injury during the match that required stitches, which may have also contributed to the decision to use the mask). On the July 16, 2010 episode of <em>SmackDown</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">the Big Show</a> dragged him on top of a giant ladder, put him in a headlock, and removed the mask, letting the world see a bald CM Punk for the first time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>: In order, CM Venom, Colt Cabana, Ace Steel, Julio Dinero, Lucy, Seth Skyfire, Kofi Kingston, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewHankinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewHankinson">Luke Gallows</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCry">Battle Cry</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">"IT'S CLOBB</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">ERIN' TIME!!!!!"</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>:<ul><li> Punk is a result of this.

As soon as he said so on <em>Monday Night Raw</em> however, "pipe bomb" quickly became shorthand for any angry, insulting promo; to the point AJ cutting down <em>Total Divas</em>, which wasn't even in the same context as Punk's famous rant, was called a "pipe bombshell".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule">Fleeting Demographic Rule</a>:<ul><li> Punk feud's with John Cena in the summer of 2011 appears to be a rehash of the 2005 "Summer of Punk" angle where Punk threatened to leave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> for WWE with the ROH World Championship. Unlike the first time, he successfully pulled it off with the WWE Championship... only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">make his triumphant return</a> two weeks later with "Cult of Personality", his old theme during the "Summer of Punk". The similarities are so striking the angle has already earned the Fan Nickname of the "Summer of Punk II".</li><li> The storyline is so well-known for propelling Punk into superstardom that TNA attempted a storyline that was a blatant rip off of this one two years later, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> as Punk and Dixie Carter as Vince McMahon. It failed for several reasons, the main reason being that this trope used to be known as the Seven Year Rule, because that's how long it takes fans to forget a storyline, allowing it to be rehashed for new wrestlers. Since this was two years after the original storyline and Punk was still in the WWE at the time, everyone could clearly see that this was one TNA's effort to recreate its magic. The last (and most ironic) reason is because Punk, who was well-known for his disputes with management, ended up re-signing because of this storyline. AJ Styles, for all his years loyally working for TNA, was also in similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> contract disputes at the time during the storyline &mdash; but unlike Punk, he <em>didn't</em> re-sign, having finally gotten sick TNA's poor treatment of him and his coworkers, forcing the company to take the title off him and kill his career in TNA in the most convoluted way possible.</li><li> The storyline also incorporates elements of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob">Montreal Screwjob</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Punk rants about everything that is wrong with the WWE</a>, and Mr. McMahon responded by suspending him, ending his career with the WWE, until Cena convinced McMahon to reinstate Punk. McMahon's response to the plea take more from the prelude which involved McMahon being worried that one of his wrestlers would jump ship with a belt which turned out to be for a reason; he attempted to pull the same thing off against Punk, and it didn't work out thanks to Cena punching out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a>, the one sent to tell the timekeeper.</li><li> Also, the character of Punk, the straight-talking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> who resonates so well with the fans that will ultimately lead to a new era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> programming, is very similar to the push of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> in the late 90s before the start of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a>. Fans have been comparing Punk to Austin, and this being the foreshadowing to the second Attitude Era. Punk even gave John Laurinaitis the GTS in the same way Austin gave the Stone Cold Stunner to the authority figures of his era.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> This may or may not have been somewhat contrived by Punk himself (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>), but his infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a> promo on the June 27, 2011 episode of <em>Raw</em> foreshadowed several things that have happened in storyline involving him in the year-plus since:<ul><li> It's in this promo where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a> is first name-dropped.</li><li> Also, he feuded with Triple H (which somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">metamorphosed into</a> Triple H vs. Kevin Nash, but hey, who's counting?)</li><li> <em>Especially</em> his bit comparing himself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> (whose name hadn't been invoked in the WWE in years) and saying that both of them were Paul Heyman guys. Lesnar would later reappear in the WWE after the following <em>WrestleMania</em>, Heyman followed him shortly afterwards, and Heyman aligned himself with Punk after Punk's heel turn. Further invoked when the term "Paul Heyman guy" actually came into play again.</li></ul></li><li> Punk also loves to do this on his Twitter occasionally. One example would be before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> where he made several references to his infamous "I am the Devil himself" speech from his Ring of Honor days.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver">Fourth-Wall Observer</a>: Punk has subtly become this ever since his whole "leaving with the title" angle. After all, Punk's whole idea of change in the WWE revolves around real life issues and the stuff he talks about can only barely make the cut to fit with the kayfabe world of wrestling. Example: Did anyone feel that at the contract signing for Punk and Cena's <em>SummerSlam</em> match, when Cena was talking about earning your opportunities, was anyone else waiting for Punk to flip the table and shout "Wrestling is scripted you idiot!!! I can't earn my opportunities because its not up to me if I win my match!!!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision">Friend or Idol Decision</a>: During his WWE Championship match with John Cena on <em>Raw 1000</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">the Big Show</a> comes down and batters Cena, KO'ing him with a right hand while the ref is out after a bump.

Matt Striker giving Serena the distinction of being "Punk's Mary Magdalene" aided the religious overtones, so it's not just Punk's doing.

Even after finding a great challenge in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> and losing the title to him, Punk felt he found the ultimate challenge in trying to end Taker's streak.

The officers determine Punk is intoxicated (without a breathlyzer), and per agreement, Punk has to vacate the title.

It's somewhat justified given Punk's reign has been overshadowed by Cena's storylines and the Rock's presence, but Punk comes off as somewhat bitter that the spotlight isn't on <em>him</em> rather than the WWE Title.</li><li> You can argue that Punk himself became this to WWE's ECW in 2007. Initially Punk was regarded as a young, rising star with potential, while the ECW title scene was dominated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley">Bobby Lashley</a> and his ilk. But then Lashley started feuding with Vince and moved to <em>Raw</em>, and Punk became the center of the ECW Originals vs New Breed storyline &mdash; in which it became increasingly more obvious that the storyline was to put him (and only him) over. Then his ECW title chase/reign dominated the show for the rest of the year and into early 2008. That being said, this wasn't necessarily a <em>bad</em> thing. Punk was by far and away the most popular wrestler there, and it can be argued that he and the then-newly christened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a> were the only reasons why anyone would watch the show at all, especially considering how WWE's ECW was a pale imitation (one might even say bastardization) of the original ECW (coincidentally, Punk wouldn't have been out of place in the original ECW, probably owing to his popularity amongst the hardcore fans). He essentially carried the show, and if it hadn't been for him, it wouldn't have lasted as nearly as long as it did, which would be detrimental as WWE's ECW was a launching platform for much of the younger talent. A similar thing happened when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a> returned in 2009 and carried it through its last year &mdash; without him, there wouldn't have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>:<ul><li> Punk's perky female disciple, Serena, very briefly started as this.</li><li> And then came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee">AJ Lee</a>.

Punk goes to ward him off, only to get Zig-Zagged by Dolph for the 1-2-3, which earns him a WWE Title match the following week.

It failed when Punk gave him a boot to the head and high-tailed it through the crowd. Unfortunately the second time he wasn't as successful.</li><li> Pulled yet <em>another</em> one on the July 25, 2011 episode of <em>Raw</em>. John Cena had just won the "WWE Championship" from Rey Mysterio, who had won the title himself earlier that night (because of Punk leaving with the belt a couple of weeks before; he was never defeated, therefore <em>Raw</em> actually had no champion). Then a strange theme began playing, and several tense moments later, who else should appear but Punk himself, carrying the real title belt.</li><li> Ended up on the wrong end of this on the January 23, 2012 episode of <em>Raw</em>.
