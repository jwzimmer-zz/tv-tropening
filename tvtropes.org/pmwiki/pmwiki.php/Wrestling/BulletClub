Members are denoted in <strong>bold</strong>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>'s more comprehensive article on Bullet Club <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Club">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>The seeds for the group were first sown in April 2013 when <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt">Prince Devitt</a></strong>, IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion, lost a champion vs. champion match to IWGP World Heavyweight Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a>. He would disrespect everyone except his Apollo 55 tag partner Ryusuke Taguchi, who he tried to get to go along with his new attitude, but completed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> by attacking Ryusuke after they failed to recapture the IWGP Junior Tag Team Championship. Devitt joined forces with <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BadLuckFale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BadLuckFale">Bad Luck Fale</a></strong>, who became Devitt's personal bouncer and was dubbed "The Underboss". At <em>Wrestling Dontaku</em>, Devitt and Fale would attack Hiroshi Tanahashi, and convinced "The Machine Gun" <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlAnderson">Karl Anderson</a></strong> (who Tanahashi had previously defeated) and <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny">Tama Tonga</a></strong> (who was in Anderson's corner) to join. Devitt took to the mic afterwards and announced the formation of a stable of <em>gaijin</em> (foreigners to Japan) &#151; the Bullet Club was born.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0i3vi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0i3vi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0i3vi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Devitt is Irish, Anderson is American, and Fale and Tama are Tongan.</span></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoot Style Era: Prince Devitt w/Karl Anderson&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p>The group immediately became a powerhouse in New Japan as Devitt swept the Best of the Super Juniors tournament and retained the Junior Heavyweight Title. While Tama shared inter promotional tours with Mexican promotion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a>, he teamed with <strong>Ray Bucanero</strong> and <strong>El Terrible</strong>, forming Latinoamerica Bullet Club (or <strong>Bullet Club Latinoamerica</strong>), a short lived sister faction that quietly dissolved later that year. Both Bucanero and Terrible would win the CMLL Tag Team titles once each with Tonga. The stable fought Tanahashi and others such as Captain New Japan, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JushinThunderLiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JushinThunderLiger">Jushin Thunder Liger</a>, and tried and failed to dethrone Tanahashi's successor champion, member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CHAOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CHAOS">CHAOS</a> faction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada">Kazuchika Okada</a>. Joining in October 2013 were <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">The Young Bucks</a></strong> (Matt and Nick Jackson), a team of dynamic wrestling brothers who went on to win the Super Juniors Tag Tournament as well as the IWGP Junior Tag Team Titles, bringing even more gold into the group. Then in November, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewHankinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewHankinson">Doc Gallows</a></strong> joined the group and became Karl Anderson's tag partner. The two behemoths would win the yearly World Tag League, earning themselves a title shot at the upcoming January 4th <em>Wrestle Kingdom VIII</em> show.</p><p>Bullet Club would find mixed success at that event; while Anderson and Gallows won the IWGP Tag Team Championship and the Bucks successfully defended their Junior Tag titles, Devitt's year-plus reign as Junior Heavyweight Champ was ended at the hands of Kota Ibushi. Shortly after, Devitt would find himself going up against a foe from the past: former tag partner Ryusuke Taguchi wanting revenge. The Devitt/Taguchi rivalry culminated in April at <em>Invasion Attack</em> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown">Loser Leaves Town</a> match. Facing off against his old friend, Devitt renounced his villainous ways and rejected any underhanded tactics, even going so far as to attack the Young Bucks when they tried to interfere on his behalf. This would result in his defeat and exodus from New Japan, leaving the Bullet Club without a leader. However, like any good villain, the Club had a Plan B.</p></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phenomenal Era: Karl Anderson &amp; AJ Styles&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p>Later in the show, after IWGP World Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada won a tag match, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a></strong> attacked him, ending with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, the Styles Clash. Styles then revealed his Bullet Club shirt, establishing himself as the newest member of the group, and co-leading the group with founding member Anderson. Styles challenged Okada for the championship, feeling Okada was still the same "young boy" he had known previously in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rq52');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1rq52" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rq52');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Okada was there for a two-year excursion during AJ's tenure with the company.</span> Their match was set for May, Wrestling Dontaku 2014. Despite Bullet Club's interference in the match Okada appeared to have the advantage, only for <strong><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YujiroTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YujiroTakahashi">Yujiro Takahashi</a></strong>, a member of Okada's own CHAOS stable, to attack Okada while the ref was distracted, then reveal his own Bullet Club shirt, formally defecting. With Okada virtually unconscious, Styles hit his finisher and brought the most prestigious belt in all of Japan into the club. Shortly afterwards Fale would capture the IWGP Intercontinental Title and Yujiro would win the NEVER Openweight Championship. Bullet Club had successfully won every title in New Japan, becoming one of the most successful stables in recent pro wrestling history.</p><p>In November 2014, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a></strong>, a Canadian cruiserweight who had been in NJPW since 2010, joined, invited by the Young Bucks. Omega announced he was gunning for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, which he won at the next January 4 show. That same night, Doc's then-wife Amber Gallows (formerly known as Amber O'Neal) started accompanying him and Anderson as "The Bullet Babe". The day after, <strong>Cody Hall</strong>, son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a>, joined as the stable's "young boy", with Anderson stating that Hall would have to earn a full spot in the stable. The day before the 2015 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, Omega invited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> Junior Heavyweight <strong>Chase Owens</strong>, needing a partner for the tournament and seeing that he had the potential to be a superstar.</p><p>At New Year's Dash 2016, after a largely unsuccessful Wrestle Kingdom 10, Styles and Omega teamed to beat CHAOS's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> and Yoshi-Hashi, with Omega doing what Styles couldn't do the night before and pinning Nakamura. Omega then turned on and attacked AJ Styles with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">One-Winged Angel</a>, following which the Young Bucks, Anderson, Gallows, and Cody Hall came out to calm the situation. However, Omega and the Bucks convinced the others to unite with them, continuing the beatdown to "fire" Styles from Bullet Club, writing him out of the New Japan company, and also cement Omega as the new leader. Omega then declared he was no longer a junior, referred to himself and the Young Bucks as The Elite sub-stable, while stating that Bullet Club rule the world, and challenged Nakamura for the Intercontinental Championship.</p></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elite Era: Kenny Omega w/The Young Bucks&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p>Nakamura would vacate the championship and the company instead, with his departure confirmed at the end of the month. Instead, Omega defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi for the vacated championship at February's <em>The New Beginning in Niigata</em>. At the same event, Anderson and Gallows, accompanied by Fale and Tama, lost their rematch opportunity to take back the IWGP Tag Team titles from Great Bash Heel and bowed to the New Japan fans, indicating their own departure from the company, which took place soon after.</p><p>Subsequently, Tama Tonga announced a new tag team partner/Club member, his brother,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zcht');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0zcht" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zcht');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">formerly known as Camacho in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> or Micah in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a></span> going by <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny">Tanga Loa</a></strong>, adopting the team moniker G.o.D: <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny">Guerrillas of Destiny</a></strong>. At Invasion Attack on April 10, 2016, the GOD defeated Great Bash Heel to reclaim the IWGP tag team titles for the Club. At the May 8 NJPW / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> joint event Global Wars, the Young Bucks and Guerrillas of Destiny were scheduled in an eight-man tag match. Though the Bucks promised a new Bullet Club member and a "superkick party" later that night, the team won without a hint of either. However, they reappeared during the ROH World Championship main event between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayLethal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayLethal">Jay Lethal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana">Colt Cabana</a>, revealing ROH stalwart and their one-time enemy <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole">Adam Cole</a></strong> in a Bullet Club shirt. The Cole-Bucks-Guerrillas tandem proceeded to destroy everyone and everything in a calamitous run-in which culminated in <em>51 superkicks</em>. The next ROH TV taping saw the group joined also by <strong>Hangman (Adam) Page</strong>. Over the next three months Cole's quest to regain the ROH World Championship (which he had held once before) resulted in him cutting the hair of then-champion Lethal, enraging Lethal into a title match at Death Before Dishonor XIV, where Lethal lost the championship for the first time in years. Cole lost the ROH Championship shortly after to former partner turned heated rival Kyle O'Reilly at ROH Final Battle.</p><p>At the September 21 Destruction in Kobe event, the new anti-Club faction "Hunter Club", led by Yoshitatsu, had a schism; with former anti-Bullet Club "Captain New Japan" being denied membership. He jumped ship to Bullet Club itself, being renamed <strong>Bone Soldier</strong> upon his debut. December 11 saw Omega reveal a new member: the American Nightmare <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a></strong> (and by extension his wife Brandi Rhodes). Cody (Rhodes) made his debut for the faction on Wrestle Kingdom 11 on January 4, 2017, defeating Juice Robinson. At the same show, the Guerrillas lost their tag team titles to Chaos members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TomohiroIshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TomohiroIshii">Tomohiro Ishii</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToruYano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToruYano">Toru Yano</a>, and Cole regained the ROH World Championship from O'Reilly for the record-setting third time overall, his second time as a member of Bullet Club, and became the first man in history to win the title outside of ROH. Meanwhile, Omega challenged Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort frequently cited as one of the best matches of all time, also starting their trilogy of similarly acclaimed matches. After Wrestle Kingdom 11, Cody (Hall) departed New Japan, and with it, the Bullet Club.</p></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil Wars&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p>Following Omega's loss, Cole began dissenting and trying to assert himself as a leader over the group. However, a storyline in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FrankieKazarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FrankieKazarian">Frankie Kazarian</a> betrayed Cole's upcoming challenger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels">Christopher Daniels</a> in favor of the Club turned out to be a ruse to distract Cole, allowing Daniels to beat him for the ROH championship on March 10. Cole blamed the Bucks for not having his back and tried to fire them from the Club, only for them to retort that their Elite cohort Omega was the only leader of Bullet Club. The tension, Cody's pursuit of Daniels' championship after Cole's failed rematch, and a storyline developed on the Bucks' YouTube series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em>, culminated with Cole being literally superkicked out of the Bullet Club by the Bucks. The Bucks replaced him with British wrestler <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MartyScurll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MartyScurll">Marty Scurll</a></strong> at Omega's call, following a loss to Tanahashi at the May 2017 <em>War of the Worlds</em> show.</p><p>This would not be the last dissent of the year for the Club, however. Cody clashed with some of Omega's decisions publicly, almost forfeiting the Omega/Okada Iron Man match, ostensibly out of concern for Omega's health. Additionally, Tama Tonga, frustrated with Omega's emphasis on the Elite and their closest cohorts to the detriment of the full Bullet Club (of which he and Fale were the only remaining founding members), delivered an impassioned promo at the G1 Tournament. In September 2017, as Kenny was unable to participate in events due to a knee injury, the G.O.D.'s younger brother was recruited to the Bullet Club, initially under the name of <strong>Leo Tonga</strong> (he would later retake his regular name of <strong>Hikuleo</strong> at the behest of Haku). In November, Bullet Club recruited two more members: Australian wrestler <strong>"Mr. Juicy" <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GinoGambino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GinoGambino">Gino Gambino</a></strong> (a graduate and trainer at Bad Luck Fale's dojo), and friend of Cody, actor <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenAmell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenAmell">Stephen Amell</a></strong>; however, both Amell and Gambino would make only sparing appearances with the group in support of their associates.</p><p><strong><span class="font-s">CIVIL WAR PART 1: TEAM KENNY VS. TEAM CODY</span></strong> <br>After these additions, more conflict brewed within the Bullet Club, highlighted at Wrestle Kingdom 12 and New Beginning in Sapporo, both in January 2018. Omega would repeatedly preference his relationship with former tag partner Kota Ibushi over Club relations, while Cody would openly critique that preference. Kenny would attempt to recruit "Switchblade" Jay White, only for him to outright reject the invitation at New Year's Dash. On the second day of New Beginning in Sapporo, Omega would cause the Young Bucks and Marty to leave in frustration with him, leading to Cody and Page attacking him, and a Kota Ibushi save. The following episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em> would suggest tensions were cooling between them all, but behind all of this, at day 1 of New Beginning in Sapporo, Tama had cut another promo, flanked by Fale and Loa. Without addressing anyone in particular, he pointed out that any leadership needs mutual respect and support with the crew. The feud continued to grow, with Cody backed by Hangman Page, Omega backed by Ibushi, and singles matches between the two pairings would be set for the upcoming <em>Supercard of Honor</em>, with leadership of the Club being implied. Through all of this, the Young Bucks and Marty would be vocally caught in the middle, with Tama silently, emotionlessly, <em>waiting</em>&#133;</p><p>Come said <em>Supercard</em>, and the Bucks appeared to have their loyalties with Omega by attempting to superkick Cody. However, they hit Kenny by mistake and cost him the match; their attempts to make peace resulted in Kenny furiously disbanding the Elite despite the Bucks' cries. The battlelines seemed to be drawn as the Golden Lovers aligned themselves with the Tongan contingent to take on Team Cody despite most members of both sides still being cordial with each other. After a 10-man tag match at Wrestling Dontaku 2018, the Club made amends with each other&#133;all save for Kenny and Cody, who still intended to kill each other. That night also saw the return of Bone Soldier, but with a new face beneath the mask: former Pro Wrestling NOAH standout <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaijiIshimori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaijiIshimori">Taiji Ishimori</a></strong>, who attacked Will Ospreay and announced his intention to gun for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>Then things got more twisted. During <em>Dominion</em> Kenny finally achieved his ultimate goal by defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada">Kazuchika Okada</a> for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, with Ibushi in his corner. The Bucks come down and the four declared themselves the <em>Golden Elite</em>, extending a peace offering to Cody only for him to decline and take one last chance at Bullet Club leadership by challenging Kenny to a title match at the <em>G1 Special</em> at Cow Palace. He would ultimately fail, but in the process show some respect for Kenny. Things finally looked to be settling down with Kenny as the undisputed leader&#133;only for Tama Tonga to FINALLY make his move with Tanga Loa and Haku, destroying nearly every other Bullet Club member. (Taiji Ishimori, Bad Luck Fale, and Hikuleo were absent, as were supporting members Amell and Gambino; the latter two would be referenced sparingly by the others on social media in relation to the storyline.) Not even the noted "Honorary Tongan" Chase Owens and Yujiro Takahashi were safe, as they too were decimated for trying to keep the peace. Cody came down and ultimately declared his loyalty to Kenny, also getting destroyed in the process. The Tongans declare themselves the "true" Bullet Club, with no leader.</p><p><strong><span class="font-s">CIVIL WAR PART 2: BULLET CLUB OG VS. BULLET CLUB ELITE</span></strong> <br>Despite being absent from the <em>G1 Special</em>'s events, Fale and the injured Hikuleo were soon revealed to be with their fellow Tongans in a Guerrillas of Destiny YouTube video that showed Fale calling the shot for the attack. Two whole different groups were now calling themselves the Bullet Club, differentiated as <em>Bullet Club OG</em> (The Tongans (Fale, Tama, Loa, HIKULEO, Haku), Ishimori, and Gambino) and <em>Bullet Club Elite</em> (Everyone else + <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi">Kota Ibushi</a>).</p><p>During the G1 Climax tournament, Tama and Fale represented BCOG in peculiar fashion, racking up disqualifications rather than points, while Omega nearly went undefeated before a string of losses as the end cost him the top spot in the B Block; Ibushi won that block instead, only to be beaten by Hiroshi Tanahashi in the final for the <em>Wrestle Kingdom</em> Briefcase. During this time Ishimori was confirmed by Tama to be with the OG faction, and after fulfilling some final obligations with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">Impact Wrestling</a></em>, he returned alongside the Tongans toward the end of the G1 tour. Following this and The Elite-hosted <em>All In</em> event in Chicago on September 1, the Bullet Club OG and Elite members would face each other in tag team action at several special events, including the Guerrillas of Destiny taking both the NEVER Six-Man and IWGP tag team titles off the Young Bucks (the former also involving the two sides' respective juniors Ishimori and Scurll) while Omega continued to defend the IWGP Heavyweight Title. The Tongans also began declaring aloud that The Elite and their allies were not Bullet Club, and in the Tongans' eyes had stopped being Bullet Club long ago, framing the conflict as <em>Bullet Club vs. The Elite</em>, as well as announcing that they were recruiting new members.</p><p>At <em>King of Pro Wrestling</em> on October 8, Tama, Fale, Loa, and Ishimori defeated Matt, Nick, Chase, and Page in an eight-man tag team match, and after the match Ishimori announced that the recruiting search had led to his choice of Australian wrestler <strong>Robbie Eagles</strong> as his new tag team partner. Later, Scurll failed to secure the vacated IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, losing in the tournament final for the title against Kushida. However, the pivotal event came in the aftermath of the next match, when a post-match attack by Jay White and Gedo following White's loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi saw both Kazuchika Okada and Gedo's longtime partner Jado come out to the ring, during which Bullet Club OG would creep onto the scene. With their agenda in mystery, they converged around Gedo, Jado, and Okada, baiting the Rainmaker into an attempt to attack Gedo only to betray him with a Gun Stun and proceed to assault him, before allowing White to finish the job. <strong>Gedo</strong>, <strong>Jado</strong>, and <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayWhite">Jay White</a></strong> all joined in on various Too Sweet gestures during this assault, cementing their new allegiance with the original brotherhood of Bullet Club, with the New Zealand native citing his history with Bad Luck Fale and Prince Devitt being responsible for having brought him into NJPW. The Elite had better luck in the main event, where Omega successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against teammates Ibushi and Cody and they all walked out as one. However, when addressing the fans alongside Ibushi, Cody, and the Bucks, he made it a point that not all of them were Bullet Club and so they were standing together as The Elite.</p></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cutthroat Era: Jay White w/Tama Tonga and EVIL Era: EVIL&nbsp;</div><div id="folder4" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p>Since then, BCOG would be regularly referred to as simply the Bullet Club, with Tama Tonga and Jay White both reinforcing this in their post-match interviews, while Omega, the Bucks, Scurll, Page, and Cody's affiliations with the group were quietly phased out. Finally, the <em>BTE</em> cast members announced on October 30 while on Chris Jericho's cruise that they were no longer part of Bullet Club and were all now simply known as The Elite. Thus the Civil War ended almost without further incident, with the exception being a Three-Way Tag match at <em>Wrestle Kingdom 13</em>, in which the Bucks were pinned by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LosIngobernablesDeJapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LosIngobernablesDeJapon">Los Ingobernables de Japon</a></em>'s EVIL and SANADA, costing G.o.D. both the Heavyweight Tag Team Championships<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rl8m');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1rl8m" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rl8m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for the second year in a row to the same team</span>, and direct revenge. After Wrestle Kingdom, the Elite started their own promotion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a>, and left both ROH and NJPW.</p><p>With the Club's identity secured, the Super Junior Tag League saw Ishimori and Eagles team together and achieve moderate success, while the heavyweight members of Bullet Club continued to rack up wins in tag team action during the tour. Even so, they continued to promise more members to come through at least two separate avenues; while Tama maintained that the BC recruiting push was actually not over, White claimed he had yet another member of CHAOS waiting on the inside to defect to Bullet Club at the most opportune time, hinting that this defection would crush Okada's spirit. At the end of 2018, Tama announced on social media that the club had chosen White as their new leader.</p><p>The Switchblade then began 2019 by defeating Kazuchika Okada clean in their grudge match at <em>Wrestle Kingdom 13</em>. Prior to this, Ishimori had defeated Kushida to claim the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, in addition to G.o.D.'s aforementioned IWGP Tag Team Championship loss to EVIL and SANADA. Meanwhile, Chase and Yujiro's affiliation with The Elite broke down after nearly six months via miscommunication in a match at the pre-show, leading to the two rejoining Bullet Club to help G.o.D. and Ishimori retain the NEVER Openweight Six-Man Tag Team Championship the next day at <em>New Year Dash</em>. While they wound up losing the Six-Man titles later in the month during an&#133;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">interesting</a> babyface phase for Tama, G.o.D. would later recover to defeat Evil and Sanada at <em>Honor Rising</em> on February 23, 2019 to become 5x IWGP Tag Team Champions, then accept a challenge that same night from ROH World Tag Team Champions The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) to a Winner takes all match for both sets of tag titles at <em>G1 Supercard</em> in Madison Square Garden.</p><p>On March 8, 2019 NJPW announced the inclusion of a new member to the ranks of Bullet Club through their YouTube channel and repeated promotions throughout the New Japan Cup. Sources later identified him as <strong>El Phantasmo</strong>, a Canadian wrestler active both in circuits in his homeland and in the British indie scene. He helped form a successful tag team with Ishimori, winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team championships. This also saw the departure of Eagles from the group; having grown tired of Bullet Club's ruthlessness, he found a new home in CHAOS, thanks to Will Ospreay. Gambino, who by this point was a color commentator for NJPW, could only look on in disgust.</p><p>As for <em>G1 Supercard</em>, the tag team championship Winner takes all match wound up being turned into a four-way with the addition of EVIL and SANADA as well as ROH's Villain Enterprises (PCO and Brody King). G.o.D. won the match and thus captured the ROH World Tag Team Championship, though the moment was marred by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass">controversy</a> post-match. Meanwhile, Okada won the New Japan Cup to become the #1 contender for Jay White's IWGP Heavyweight Championship, finally defeating White as well as reclaiming the title in the <em>Supercard</em> main event.</p><p>Before the final day of the 29th G1 Climax, Tama Tonga tweeted that he had managed to recruit a "world-class" athlete into Bullet Club. To the surprise of many, it was former NOAH and NXT roster member <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobayashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobayashi">KENTA</a></strong>, who had just made his New Japan debut 2 months prior and had remained an unaffiliated roster member since then. In a 6 man tag match, KENTA betrayed his former allies in CHAOS and even best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata">Katsuyori Shibata</a> by allying with the Bullet Club in a massive beatdown, eventually taking the NEVER Openweight Title from CHAOS members (and Shibata's friends) Ishii and Goto, in turns.</p><p>In late 2019, Gino Gambino made a surprise return to his home promotion (NJPW affiliate) <em>Melbourne City Wrestling</em> (MCW), attacking a visiting Will Ospreay. In his promo, he alluded to a war between CHAOS and Bullet Club to take place in 2020... Only for most 2020 wrestling plans to be put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting real life. Time will tell how Bullet Club wars with CHAOS, its members Ospreay and Eagles, and Shibata, in the future.</p><p>When New Japan returned to having events in June 2020 upon adhering to social distancing guidelines, many of its key members &mdash; White, KENTA, Fale, G.O.D. and Phantasmo chief among them &mdash; were left overseas and out of the New Japan Cup. This didn't stop them from pulling out one more ace in the hole: <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EVIL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EVIL">EVIL</a></strong> shocked the world by not only beating Kazuchika Okada to win the whole tournament, but also turned his back on his comrades in Los Ingobernables de Japon by attacking Tetsuya Naito and defecting to Bullet Club; this decision would pay a mere 24 hours later, when EVIL defeated Naito to bring both the IWGP Heavyweight and Intercontinental championships simultaneously to his new crew. With Bullet Club now wordwide due to pandemic reasons, EVIL, Jay, and Tama declared that EVIL would "lead" and front the Bullet Club in Japan for now.</p><p>Shortly after EVIL's win, NJPW announced a weekly US based show called New Japan Strong, starting with a tournament to determine the challenger for the IWGP US title. With four entrants (KENTA, Loa, Chase, and Tama), Bullet Club had a man in every single first round match. Indeed, it was KENTA who went all the way, defeating David Finlay in the final for the briefcase. Hikuleo and White also returned to action stateside during the New Japan Strong series.</p></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><hr><p></p><div class="quoteright" style="width:320px;"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/568747_1.jpg" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/568747_1.jpg"></div><div class="acaptionright" style="width:320px;">That's Japanese for "Club".</div><div class="quoteright" style="width:320px;"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/balor_club_9.jpg" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/balor_club_9.jpg"></div><p>The Club (and its variations B&aacute;lor Club/The OC/OGBC) are concepts related to the Bullet Club, effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Bland-Name Product</a> used to reference its members' time in the Bullet Club, without outright promoting NJPW.</p><p>Upon leaving NJPW, former Bullet Club leader Prince Devitt would make his WWE debut in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">NXT</a> brand as <strong>Finn B&aacute;lor</strong>, referencing his fanbase as the "B&aacute;lor Club", revitalizing NXT, and eventually becoming its record-setting champion.

Despite his initial reluctance, AJ accepted their help and officially reunited "The Club" for a war of trios. After Styles failed to win the WWE World Championship at <em>Extreme Rules</em> with the help of Gallows and Anderson, Styles told them that they should separate and remain friends, but Anderson and Gallows refused and ended their friendship with Styles&#133; only for that to be revealed as a ruse, as they reunited the next week to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHashtag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHashtag">#BeatUp</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>", firmly completing Styles' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>, and establishing Anderson and Gallows as a Heel tag team.</p><p>With the 2016 WWE draft and brand split, Styles was drafted to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown Live</a></em> but Anderson and Gallows were drafted to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">Raw</a></em>, separating them. However, B&aacute;lor was drafted to <em>Raw</em> (as a babyface), as well. Following a segment at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> which included all four men teasing a reunion, Styles defeated Cena cleanly, while B&aacute;lor became the first-ever WWE Universal Championship by defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> (vacated it the next day due to injury). A month later Styles beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> to become WWE World Champion. At <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> 2017</em> Gallows and Anderson became WWE Raw Tag Team Champions by defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar">The Bar</a>. Less than a year after their debuts, all members of "The Club" had become a champion, though they were separated by brands and alignments. The spring of 2017 saw Gallows and Anderson used less on TV, and B&aacute;lor's return from an injury saw him working <em>against</em> them in minor matches. Though a Club reunion seemed dim, a viral outbreak in the locker room prior to the 2017 TLC pay-per-view PPV prompted B&aacute;lor and Styles to compete in an inter-brand replacement match, which WWE promoted as the first in-ring collision of the two former leaders of "The Club" when it was "in Japan". Though the <em>two</em> shared <em>sweet</em> moments, Gallows and Anderson were still not featured. By the end of 2017, there were no signs of any reunion of The Club.</p><p>January 2018, however&#133;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether">B&aacute;lor would call on Gallows and Anderson to aid him in a six-man tag team match</a>, temporarily turning them Face. After that, they appeared twice more on TV as a cohesive unit, finally referring to themselves as the B&aacute;lor Club while also donning shirts reading OGBC, before Anderson and Gallows were drafted to <em>SmackDown</em> in the post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em> Superstar Shake-Up. The pair teamed with Styles on one more TV appearance as of June 2018, before reuniting with him in a collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> in June 2019 after all four men switched brands. B&aacute;lor, meanwhile, turned heel after returning to (the now-televised) NXT in October, incorporating his prior attitude and mannerisms from his last year in Japan into a reignited persona, and putting him in television timeslot competition with The Elite on AEW.

This eventually became a point of dissent with those who primarily operated in New Japan, including founding members Bad Luck Fale and Tama Tonga, who felt that Omega neglected the Bullet Club being a brotherhood in the same manner that Prince Devitt, Karl Anderson and AJ Styles treated it during their time as leaders, focusing solely on the Elite and their affiliates. Furthermore, Omega has had bubbling issues with at least one of said "affiliates" throughout all of 2017. He spent the first half of the year rebuffing Adam Cole's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">Big Bad Wannabe</a> ambitions and ultimately kicking Cole out of the Club, only to then start having problems with Cody over various decisions they disagreed about and even trying to make subtle moves on Cody's wife. All in all, Omega only cares about one half of the Bullet Club and is running that half of the Club into near disrepair, while the other half has to maintain unity in the background and are getting sick and tired of it. Recently this was toned down in the tail end of 2017 after the Bucks entered legal trouble with WWE, but only the Elite affiliates adjusted to support them, and the Bucks were the only ones who came to help Omega after five minutes of him being battered and bloodied by an ambush attack from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>.</li><li> At <em>Wrestle Kingdom 12</em> in 2018, the Elite were the only BC members to win their matches, including Omega's match against Jericho. During Cody's match with Kota Ibushi, Cody attempted to play mind games by taking a shot at Kenny's "love" for Ibushi but lost the match. The next night at <em>New Year's Dash</em> he attempted to lead Bullet Club members in destroying Ibushi after beating Kota's team in a ten-man tag match, only to be stopped by Omega, who told him he wasn't the Bullet Club leader. Knowing what happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole">the last man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">the Elite pulled rank on</a>, he instantly began to question his worth in Omega's system. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by "Switchblade" Jay White, who Omega tried to bring into Bullet Club supposedly to stop the infighting only to be literally driven flat on his face for his efforts, the Club had been almost made to worship Omega and have already begun to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">turn against him</a>.</li><li> New Beginning in Sapporo (as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em> episode 90, covering events from both before and after said show) saw Cody take out Kenny after his loss of the United States Championship to Jay White, particularly in response to him stopping Hangman Page from laying claim as a challenger to White's title. Page agreed to help Cody attack Kenny, while Marty Scurll merely begged him for an explanation, until Ibushi came out to save Kenny, who refused his handshake only for them to suddenly embrace, reuniting the Golden Lovers. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em> reveals that Kenny had been sketchy and distant with his Elite colleagues in the days prior to the event, and in the aftermath Cody and Page are committed to moving on post-Kenny while Marty remains non-committal&#133;and the Bucks have invited Ibushi and Omega into room 710. It seems the battle lines in the divide between Bullet Club and The Elite have finally started being drawn.</li><li> And when finally the Bullet Club started to truly heal with Cody seemingly giving Kenny his respect and Kenny offering an olive branch&#133;the Tongans attacked at the G1 Special in San Francisco and created the Bullet Club OG to battle the Bullet Club Elite. Where one rift healed, another explosively opened. Furthermore, rather than healing, this rift was solved through the two halves being cast apart from each other into two entirely separate houses, both of which seem to be united within themselves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51">Area 51</a>: The subject of the summer 2019 "Storming Area 51" meme. This is relevant here because Chase Owens and Bad Luck Fale played to the meme, constantly referencing it as though they planned to get the rest of Bullet Club to help.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>:<ul><li> The most prominent example of this trope would be the CHAOS stable led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada">Kazuchika Okada</a>.<ul><li> For Nakamura's part, he quickly became this for Bad Luck Fale, the two having faced each other several times in single and tag matches and having traded the IWGP Intercontinental Championship between them before Nakamura's departure, and towards the end of his New Japan run all the way into his WWE run he maintained rivalries with both Styles and Devitt/B&aacute;lor which seemed respectful at first before he came to viciously turn against them as soon as Styles beat him.</li><li> As for Okada, both Devitt and Anderson had turns at him and the company's lionized babyface <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a> over the IWGP Heavyweight Title, but only Styles managed to break in and become their real third rival. Omega became the perennial fourth rival against them and Naito later on, but with much more respectful tones than his predecessors. However, Jay White's machinations and betrayal of CHAOS, taking Gedo with him to the group whose leaders recruited him to Japan in the first place, were enough to force Okada's CHAOS team and Tanahashi's main "lion mark" unit to join forces to take on the reassembled tower of Bullet Club &#151; which still didn't keep him from capturing the title for two months.</li></ul></li><li> Between the IWGP Heavyweight and NEVER Six-Man tag team championship hunts, The Guerrillas of Destiny's main rivals would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToruYano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToruYano">Toru Yano</a> and Ryusuke Taguchi, who would often team against them with a third partner for the Six-Man belts, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LosIngobernablesDeJapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LosIngobernablesDeJapon">Los Ingobernables de Japon</a> members EVIL and SANADA, who often ran up against them in consecutive World Tag League finals and Wrestle Kingdom IWGP title matches.</li><li> Among The Elite-connected members, The Young Bucks would bring reDRagon baggage involving both the IWGP Junior and ROH tag belts. Adam Cole would continue this with his feud with Kyle O'Reilly over the ROH World Championship, before oddly enough <em>trying</em> to have this with Omega over control of the group, getting the boot before too long, and reuniting with O'Reilly and Bobby Fish as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndisputedEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndisputedEra">The Undisputed Era</a>. Still, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> dynamic would develop anyway, between Omega and Cody instead, finally becoming the final straw that forced G.o.D to go full Firing Squad and violently eject the entire Elite party from Bullet Club. The Elite narrowly avoided this trope with Bullet Club by conceding the war on a cruise ship months before departing for AEW.</li><li> Across the pond in McMahon-land, Styles, Anderson and Gallows went to war with the Anoa'i dynasty (specifically Reigns and the Usos) over the WWE Championship, and also faced off against John Cena, Dean Ambrose, and The New Day in 2016. In the brief B&aacute;lor Club run in early 2018, Finn and The Good Brothers' main rivalry was with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> and his Miztourage, though they also briefly antagonized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>, Roman Reigns&#133; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JasonJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JasonJordan">Jason Jordan</a> (so no, it was not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>). In 2018 Nakamura's post-match attack on Styles at WrestleMania 34 also paved the way for him to become enemies with B&aacute;lor the following year, and Anderson and Gallows had a front row seat to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a>'s cruel baiting of AJ by using his family. The OC trio with Styles later added Ricochet, Viking Raiders and Braun Strowman to their rivals list in 2019 while also picking up where things left off with both New Day and Rollins.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol">Arc Symbol</a>: A skull with two AK-47s in an "X" formation.

But the closest to a literal example has to be Cody's most recent win of the ROH World Championship at <em>Best in the World</em> 2017, where, following his pinfall victory over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels">Christopher Daniels</a>, he celebrated with a cheering crowd, the Bucks, Scurll, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em> video camera/phone, and a microphone in which he got to cut a promo declaring that he was no longer the Prince of Pro Wrestling, he was now the King running over everyone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker">Badass Biker</a>: The Bullet Club is heavily inspired by this trope. Many of the members make frequent use of black leather in their entrance attire. There's a legitimate biker club in India called the Royal Enfield Bullet Club centered around a specific brand bike of the same name. And two of its (former) top members, AJ Styles and Doc Gallows, had both been seen riding motorcycles in wrestling media during their last gimmicks before joining Bullet Club. Oh, and ask original leader Prince Devitt <a class="urllink" href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ec/53/a4/ec53a44f0ac877d768a372a57441d1f6.jpg">what this was all about<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a>: Kenny Omega and Karl Anderson used to wear them to the ring.

Despite being brought in as a mercenary and to fill the Junior Division hole left by original leader Prince Devitt, he never openly showed disloyalty to the club's senior members and leaders. However, as soon as he saw weakness in the club with every major member (other than The Young Bucks) losing at Wrestle Kingdom 10 the night before, he made sure he was the one to pick up the ball by pinning Intercontinental Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> in his and AJ Styles' tag match against Nakamura and Yoshi-Hashi, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">attacked AJ and convinced the club in a brief argument to finish Styles off</a>, essentially marking him as the new leader.</li><li> Adam Cole started to show shades of it as the head of the Club's ROH operations. In 2017, Cole teased dissension in the ranks with Kenny Omega after their tag team match at the first day of Honor Rising. He then attempted to kick the Young Bucks out of the Club, only for them to state that Omgea was the group's leader and that Cole had no say in the matter. The Bucks instead kicked Cole out of the Club in May, fitting, at the behest of Omega, replacing him with Marty Scurll.</li><li> With Cole's exit, the role of ambitious substitute Bullet Club leader did not disappear. It instead split between two members who started having issues with Omega later on in the year: Cody Rhodes and Tama Tonga.<ul><li> For Cody, it started with Omega taking an act of concern (nearly throwing in the towel when it looked like Kenny couldn't go during a title match against Okada) and turning it back on him in an act of spite (by trying to force Cody's wife Brandi to do the same when Cody had his turn), then covertly making overtures toward his wife on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em>. As Cody's heelishness started to shine through and Kenny cemented himself more as a semi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a> despite leading what was supposed to be a notoriously villainous group, things deteriorated to the point Cody was openly treating himself (and anyone he was working with without issue) as being Bullet Club leaders.</li><li> For Tama, it was a building frustration with Kenny's concern being more about The Elite than Bullet Club in general which eventually bubbled over during their 2017 G1 Climax encounter<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3pp5e');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3pp5e" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3pp5e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as well as a related friendly tag match</span> thanks to Omega being decked out in all Elite gear. Though things were able to settle down post-match, Tama (along with Bad Luck Fale) signaled his intent to have the "OGs" take back Bullet Club every chance they got on Twitter since then, including defiantly having NJPW's Bullet Club members continue using the iconic "Too Sweet" Turkish Wolf hand-signal even after the Young Bucks got themselves slapped with a legitimate Cease and Desist by WWE.</li><li> At New Beginning in Sapporo 2018, night one saw Tama's post-match comments veer into an impassioned rant about possibly having to come unhinged and stop being anyone's second in order to correct the issues in Bullet Club, while night two saw Cody finally attack Kenny, which prompted Kota Ibushi to save the Cleaner while the rest of the BTE members stood divided over the issue. With Kenny's obliviousness to his own faults and Cody's newfound treachery stoking the fires of division with their friends, Tama and Fale continued to galvanize and unite their part of Bullet Club as it floated in the background. Ultimately, Kenny and Cody ended up fighting one last time for at the G1 Special San Francisco for Kenny's newly-won IWGP Heavyweight Championship, before finally beginning to reconcile&#133;only for the Tongans to strike at the Elites and act as the BC's "Firing Squad" after a year of frustration.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">Beard of Evil</a>: Tonga's face paint is meant to make it stand out more, at least when the beard itself isn't painted anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>:<ul><li> Prince Devitt was this at first. Though his reign lasted less than a year, Devitt had sprouted seeds for the future of Bullet Club.</li><li> Karl Anderson and AJ Styles took over as this (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Big Bad Duumvirate</a> below), until&#133;</li><li> Kenny Omega usurped control of Bullet Club and essentially played this role for just over two years (his third year as leader saw him act as more of a babyface/tweener, with other members looking to displace him playing the stable's main heels).</li><li> Styles returns to this position as the main focus of The Club in WWE and then as the top heel on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown Live</a></em>.</li><li> Adam Cole at one point became the main man for the Bullet Club takeover of ROH. He was later surpassed by Cody Rhodes and then replaced as a member by Marty Scurll, but has turned up in NXT as a conquering schemer with two of the Club's (and his own) former enemies, Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly.</li><li> With their OG faction successfully separating Bullet Club from The Elite, Tama Tonga would officially name Jay White, the man who Bad Luck Fale and Prince Devitt had brought into the company four years prior, as the new leader of Bullet Club at the end of 2018.</li><li> With NJPW returning to operations following a three-month hiatus due to COVID-19, Jay White and the Tongans were all stuck overseas, forcing a Japanese restocking of Bullet Club...that was spearheaded by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> of none other than former rival EVIL, who snatched Tetsuya Naito's championships literally a day after betraying him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Big Bad Duumvirate</a>:<ul><li> In the time between Prince Devitt's departure and Kenny Omega's coup (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy">Bastard Understudy</a> above), Karl Anderson was the defacto leader of the group, cutting their promos and seemingly fronting their decisions, which made sense since he held seniority as one of the co-founders including Devitt and had the best mic skills of the group. But with AJ Styles holding the IWGP Title while appearing on the American indies moreso than in New Japan, he was the man to beat, making him a combination of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief">Dragon-in-Chief</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">The Face</a> of the organization. In fact, AJ had been considered the leader in Bullet Club's US operations such as ROH, a status which New Japan recognized towards the end of his run there. In any case, neither man ever claimed to be the absolute leader and there never seemed to be any signs of either subservience or a power struggle, at least not between these two.</li><li> Kenny Omega may be the official leader of Bullet Club in 2016, but Adam Cole is just as close to the Young Bucks as he is and is the central figure in its current Ring of Honor operations, even becoming the ROH World Champion, while AJ remains the leader of the offshoot faction and has the strongest presence in America as the WWE Champion. Despite getting along initially, Omega and Cole have shown signs of disagreement since the former's return to New Japan after a brief hiatus following <em>Wrestle Kingdom 11</em>. This and other actions culminated in Cole's exodus from Bullet Club.</li><li> Cody went on to take Cole's position as the ROH proxy leader, also winning the company's World Championship. For the most part Cody and Omega get along far better than he and Cole did, though there are occasional hints of Omega's attitude wearing thin with both Cody and Tama Tonga and causing potential friction between the larger Bullet Club and The Elite. Things ultimately deteriorated to the point that by the end of January 2018, Cody had attacked Omega in a New Japan ring and Tama indicated he was finished with himself and Bullet Club being lackeys to the current division.</li><li> Tama Tonga and Bad Luck Fale essentially became this as the primary shot-callers and coordinators of Bullet Club OG, seeking to take back Bullet Club from the clutches of The Elite and restore the faction to the original violent brotherhood state in which they founded it along with its previous leaders. They later added to this unit by making it a trio with a new ace for the group in Jay White, later naming him the official new leader. Even then, the group is established in such a way that White is more akin to what AJ was during his tenure as leader &#151; less of a true decision maker, but more of being the best wrestler the group had to offer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">Big Bad Wannabe</a>: Adam Cole has 100% become this in 2017.<ul><li> Trying to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Eviler Than Thou</a> with Kenny Omega from the moment Omega came back from his post-Wrestle Kingdom 11 hiatus, despite said comeback occurring <em>as partners in a tag team match.</em> This included abandoning several double team opportuniti <em>-ADAM COLE BAY BAY!-</em> as well as constantly cutting into Omega's post-match return promo <em>-ADAM COLE BAY BAY!-</em></li><li> Attempting to "fire" from the Bullet Club <em>the very same Young Bucks that brought <strong>him</strong> into Bullet Club</em> because they "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">didn't have his back</a>" when he fell for a trap by people who've done the same trap before.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5aoqr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5aoqr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5aoqr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Frankie Kazarian pretending to betray Christopher Daniels only to turn around and help Daniels win a title match has already been done before &#151; as part of a TNA World Tag Team Title defense against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> and, ironically enough, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a></em>.</span></li><li> Calling TSA to keep Omega out of the US on grounds of child abuse so he couldn't make it to a set of ROH tapings.

The BCOG were supposed to be the second coming of the "true" Bullet Club, willingly cheating to get ahead in matches and sticking together no matter what, leading a lot of people to expect Tama and Fale to have big years in the G1 Climax. The Climax comes around and&#133;well it seems the BCOG have forgotten the concept of cheating to WIN a match. The Tongans end up causing more DQ finishes in this single G1 Climax than NJPW has had in the last five entire years combined, all to "prove a point". Most of the field now treat the BCOG as an annoyance rather than any discernible threat, especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayWhite">Jay White</a> is showing how to cheat to actually win (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToruYano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToruYano">Toru Yano</a>, but everyone expects that from him and even he toned it down this year).

They also became more heavily dominant in the war against The Elite following the G1, swiping two tag team championships from the Young Bucks. Finally, the aforementioned Jay White would soon join the OG covenant himself, in an act which they described as inevitable due to their role in his recruitment to NJPW, while also taking the legendary wrestlers-turned-managers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4i8nu');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4i8nu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4i8nu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and company bookers</span> Jado and Gedo with him in defecting from CHAOS.

He would occasionally joke about it by refusing to speak or understand Japanese when interviewed with the Club, leaving most of the duties to Kenny Omega. Subverted in that he began proudly calling himself the Tokyo Pimp, bringing Japanese gogo dancers to the ring in his entrance, and finally began to speak Japanese again after befriending new member Taiji Ishimori in 2018.</li><li> Kenny Omega turned on what was effectively his adopted home. Before joining Bullet Club, he said that he no longer considered himself a <em>gaijin</em>, but then said he had lied and was interested only in money and the Junior Heavyweight crown. This was ultimately proven to be a lie when he and the Elite took over Bullet Club and promptly began turning into gradual babyfaces, interacting positively with wrestling crowds both in Japan, the US, and abroad, while campaigning to change the wrestling world according to Omega's vision of "love and strength".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroomstickQuarterstaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroomstickQuarterstaff">Broomstick Quarterstaff</a>: Omega, though usually limited to his entrance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">The Brute</a>: Fale, G.O.D. and Gallows each serve as this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>: How certain members were dismissed.<ul><li> Primarily in relation to the departures of Pince Devitt and AJ Styles, both being betrayed by the Young Bucks (also in relation to Gallows and Anderson, who were not betrayed). Originally played straight for years, as the Bullet Club acted for the most part as though AJ being violently kicked out never happened, and treated him as though he was still a good brother representing in WWE like Prince Devitt/Finn B&aacute;lor. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> or retconned during the initial schism, as Tama Tonga made it clear on social media that he remembered what Omega and the others did to Styles, pointed out that they did it when he and Fale weren't present, and professed that he much preferred the days when Bullet Club was united with one goal, with Devitt, Styles and Anderson at the front of the pack. Finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> following the true launch of the Bullet Club Civil War, as Tama stated in his <em>Sports Illustrated</em> interview that the seeds for the Civil War were sewn the moment The Elite formed and eliminated Styles. When Hangman Page took shots at Bad Luck Fale and the BCOG, claiming that they were stuck in the past and acting like they were still hanging out with Karl Anderson and AJ Styles in 2015, this was another hint that under Omega's vision, the BC Elite no longer cared about preserving the past kinships with the original good brothers that had forged the Club's power to begin with.</li><li> Styles himself played it to the same conclusion. For years whenever he was forced to bring up the beating they gave him on the way out, he would express some type of wish that it be forgotten about. However, during the schism, when he was asked in a panel in 2018 which side he supported in the Civil War, Styles brought up the beating to explain that he supported the Firing Squad. Around the same time, Devitt tweeted an x-ray supposedly og his own injured wrist, doing the inverted Too Sweet gesture the BCOG were using. With the Elite officially gone from Bullet Club, Tama Tonga declared AJ's dismissal to be this, saying AJ, Devitt, Anderson, and Gallows are still officially BC members.</li><li> Repeated with Chase and Yujiro's exile from the Club during the Civil War. During the assault at the G1 Supercard, the Tongans attacked anyone who attempted to stop them from assaulting the Elite, including Chase and Yujiro, and for some months, the pair were treated as exiled. Then, after it became apparent the war would be more of a cold war not resolved in the ring, Chase and Yujiro were welcomed back and treated by the OG Club as having been on a spy mission to ensure the Elite failed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonName">Canon Name</a>: In NJPW, ROH, and TNA, Cody Rhodes' surname is this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Co-Dragons</a>: Bad Luck Fale and Tama Tonga consider themselves this to Jay White after appointing him as the new frontman of Bullet Club, although a closer look at how the club operates in the Cutthroat Era arguably puts all three at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">equal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">importance</a> heading the group, with Jay as the weapon, Tama as the pillar, and Fale as the general.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Combination Attack</a>: AJ and the Bucks used simultaneous suicide dives.

Styles has taken to using Devitt's Bloody Sunday DDT (which he outright admitted on Twitter was a tribute to Devitt), while Devitt used a variation of AJ's Pel&eacute; kick on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a> as Finn B&aacute;lor.</li><li> Both WWE and Anderson himself pretty much confirmed in the lead-up to his NXT title shot in 2015 taking place at a special show in Japan that Anderson and Devitt are still as close friends as ever. Devitt proudly showed off some of his Bullet Club gear during a WWE Netowrk documentary in which he went through his history, which also showed pictures of him with Anderson as well as a clip of them greeting again when Anderson came down to see him in Florida prior to the trip. On Anderson's part, said reunion trip also produced a Vine video from Anderson's account of the two hanging out with Karl's sons, as well as an appearance by Devitt on Anderson and Gallows' "Talk'n Shop" podcast in which Devitt described his exit from the Club with the words "I orchestrated a little babyface scenario."</li><li> Despite ROH acknowledging the "executive decision" that went down in Japan with Styles' excommunication at the beginning of 2016, Anderson and Gallows as well as the Young Bucks all aided Styles and enjoyed a curtain call with him in his final appearance with the company before his Royal Rumble debut. Then when Anderson and Gallows made their way into WWE, they made it their mission to reunite with him again, with their Bullet Club history explicitly referenced in all but name (they were simply called The Club).</li><li> The Club has Japanese characters on their clothing, referencing their time in Japan.</li><li> In a post-show video after the July 18 episode of <em>Raw</em>, Anderson stated that "The Club owned Japan." Styles and Gallows corrected with "Still do." Stealth reference thinly masked by the fact that they recently headlined a WWE tour of Japan.</li><li> In his match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TomohiroIshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TomohiroIshii">Tomohiro Ishii</a> during the 2016 G1 Climax tournament, Tama Tonga countered the Ishii Driller into a cutter, which was Anderson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> during his time in New Japan (as the Gun Stun), then hit him with another one to get the pin. Tama has since adopted it as his finisher.</li><li> In the last moments of the 2016 G1 Climax, Kenny Omega hit Hirooki Goto with a Bloody Sunday, a Styles Clash, AND his One-Winged Angel for the victory.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> 2016 found Styles, Gallows, and Anderson reuniting backstage for the first time since the draft and discussing their matches later that night. Then, they look off camera, and it pans to see...Finn B&aacute;lor in his B&aacute;lor Club shirt. They offer him a Too Sweet, but he just smiles and walks away. Hilariously, The Club aren't even mad, and Styles even gives a knowing glance and point to the camera.<ul><li> This would pay off more than a year later, where B&aacute;lor and Styles faced each other in an impromptu match at <em>TLC 2017</em> in which Styles was flown over from South America to fill in for an infirm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a>, who was supposed to be B&aacute;lor's opponent. After B&aacute;lor defeated Styles in an instant classic that had no business being one under the circumstances, both men would finally share a Too Sweet together before Styles gave B&aacute;lor the ring, the entire scene being reminiscent of a pre-Elite Bullet Club G1 match.</li></ul></li><li> A week after giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston">Big E Langston</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">groin</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">injury</a>, Gallows and Anderson posed as <strong>doctors</strong> in a vignette mocking his "ringpostitis".

Speaking of which&#133;pay attention to the next two.</li><li> During a Bullet Club vs. Chaos six-man tag team match, Loa scoop-slams Yano near the corner and then goes to intimidate the referee while Fale and Tama pull Yano groin-first into the post the same way Anderson and Gallows did Big E. Fale even outright says "ringpostitis" ten seconds later.</li><li> We got one to a <em>different</em> company and club. Once upon a time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> there was a pack called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AcesAndEights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AcesAndEights">Aces &amp; Eights</a>, which Doc was a part of, only to leave after the group passed him over for Vice President in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenAnderson">a different Mr. Anderson</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8ybs6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8ybs6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8ybs6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">In reality</a> TNA had neglected to renegotiate his contract before it ran out despite his best efforts to notify them.</span> Then over a year later, two particular brothers who formerly led that pack decided to make a direct challenge to the Bullet Club when TNA held Bound for Glory in Japan. Fast forward again, nearly two more years later to the night after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoyz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoyz">The Dudley Boyz</a>, announced their departure after a full year back in WWE. In came Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows jumping the Dudleyz, driving both Bubba Ray onto the outside floor and D-Von through a table in the ring with the Magic Killer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">destroying them with no chance of retaliation</a> (at least directly, anyway; Bully Ray would resurface entering a feud against the ROH contingent of Bullet Club).</li><li> Fale has shouted out Anderson and Gallows while too-sweeting the camera during his entrance on occasion. He also shouted them out along with B&aacute;lor and Styles during his post-match press minute on Bullet Club's five-year anniversary.</li><li> B&aacute;lor once worked together with Anderson and Gallows to eliminate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> during a battle royal, then almost exchanged a Too-Sweet afterwards until the Good Brothers' new friend Elias attacked B&aacute;lor from behind.</li><li> Two weeks after the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown Live</a></em> crew held <em>Raw</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">under siege</a> to kick off the year's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series</a></em> storyline, New Day suddenly turned up in the crowd announcing that the blue team was about to hold the show under siege again. So <em>Raw</em> General Manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> had a crew of <em>Raw</em> superstars united to fend off the second impact. The three <em>Raw</em> guys who led the charge? B&aacute;lor, Anderson and Gallows.</li><li> On the New Year's Day 2018 edition of Raw, B&aacute;lor, Gallows and Anderson finally reunited in a victorious six-man tag team match against Elias, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas">Bo Dallas</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtisAxel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtisAxel">Curtis Axel</a>.</li><li> Aside from a mutiny against Bullet Club Elite, Bullet Club OG is a love-letter to&#133;well, the original pre-Elite days of the Bullet Club. Tama Tonga's <em>Sports Illustrated</em> interview put forward the notion that while Bullet Club operates in Japan, it can be found in WWE, referencing Finn B&aacute;lor, AJ Styles, Karl Anderson, and Luke Gallows as being "loyal to us" and "Bullet Club for life". Tama even claimed that the alumni approved of their strike, which Styles himself would confirm when asked which side he supports at San Diego Comic Con. Even the "Firing Squad" shirt they debuted in their attack in San Francisco bears the same color scheme as the original, pre-Bone Soldier, Bullet Club shirt.</li><li> AJ and the Good Brothers became known as The OC upon their collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> in 2019, with the catchphrase of "The Official, The Original, The Only Club That Matters" first introduced by Anderson on Twitter. After a few days of being bombarded with mentions about it once the tagline hit TV, Tama offered <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Tama_Tonga/status/1153867587652083712">his own take<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> affirming that everything between the two sides was still above board.</li><li> Towards the end of G1 29, Bullet Club's "world-class" recruit turned out to be KENTA, in a massive betrayal of the CHAOS/Hontai alliance, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata">Katsuyori Shibata</a>. But there are two others he goes way back with as well. After all, when Prince Devitt first debuted on NXT and became Finn B&aacute;lor, who was it again that brought him in to help against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAscension">The Ascension</a>? And before that, who again was a symbolic mentor to Taiji Ishimori back in his NOAH days?</li><li> The OC's raid of NXT in November 2019 saw them take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TommasoCiampa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TommasoCiampa">Tommaso Ciampa</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattRiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattRiddle">Matt Riddle</a>, and Keith Lee in a six-man tag team match, only for Finn B&aacute;lor to come out, distract Ciampa long enough for Styles to hit him with a Pel&eacute;, and attack Riddle with a 1916 on the outside. Styles and B&aacute;lor stared at each other for a moment before both slowly raising Bullet Club taunts, Finn's finger guns and AJ's Too Sweet.<ul><li> Said OC raid also started with an attack on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndisputedEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndisputedEra">The Undisputed Era</a>, who B&aacute;lor seemed to be courting an alliance with... until weeks later when B&aacute;lor leveled Adam Cole with a swift overhead kick, then marked a challenge for Cole's NXT Championship.</li></ul></li><li> On the September 1, 2020 of NXT during the Fatal 4-Way for the vacant NXT Championship, B&aacute;lor and Cole are the only ones in the ring, and they seem to make a quick alliance by Two Sweeting each other, only for B&aacute;lor to attack his clubmate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask">Cool Mask</a>: The Bone Soldier mask became established as such with its second wearer, Taiji Ishimori.

Later, Adam Cole and the Bucks would serve as the Club's ROH representatives or "away team" with Cole holding the ROH World Title on the group's behalf. Cody also represents the club outside of those promotions. Prior to the in-house schisms getting out of control, the members seemed to act on Twitter like the Bullet Club is still one entity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">ignoring</a> the time they threw AJ out, and regarding The Club, the ROH branch and the main team in NJPW as still being the same thing. Even after the "firing squad" mutiny of Bullet Club OG, Tama Tonga affirms that the ex-Club members in WWE are considered to be Bullet Club for life, and Styles has confirmed his support for the Tongans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdChant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdChant">Crowd Chant</a>:<ul><li> Karl Anderson has had his promos interrupted by "Fuck TNA" chants at ROH events, such as War Of The Worlds.

A more straight example would be Chase Owens and Yujiro Takahashi initially aligning themselves with the Elite contingent when the civil war occurred, and even did so for a spell after the Elite split from Bullet Club formally. Eventually, they returned to the OG group under Jay White's leadership. <em>NJPW Southern Showdown</em> saw Robbie Eagles defect from Bullet Club to CHAOS at the culmination of a storyline where Phantasmo cheating Eagles out of their match at <em>Best of the Super Juniors</em> and then repeatedly undermining him for the rest of the tour afterwards caused Eagles to become conflicted about taking part in Bullet Club's dirty tactics, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WillOspreay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WillOspreay">Will Ospreay</a> sensed and took advantage of to reextend his CHAOS invite to Eagles.

Pretty much everything the man has said in official material since joining Bullet Club was either explicitly or implicitly about himself &#151; even when talking about the club as a whole. His entrance is the most blatantly self-aggrandizing of them all in the way he sings his own theme song operatically, blatantly over-emphasizes his gun point pose, and uses his teammates (especially younger members Chase Owens and Cody Hall) as sidekicks and item-carriers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">He openly threatens</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualDeathThreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualDeathThreat">to kill his opponents</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">over perceived slights</a>, and even when standing in the club's midst could often be seen staring off to the side or at one of the others with a crazed look on his face. "The Cleaner" is clearly insane. That said, the Young Bucks are there to keep everything together and when it comes down to it, Kenny still occasionally shows clear loyalty to Bullet Club itself even as the leader. On the other hand, the fact that he's not overly attached to the fraternal concept of Bullet Club and instead more focused on spreading their dominance to impart his vision on the business allows him to be a more efficient leader, sensing when someone starts to become a liability and reacting accordingly &#151; an increasing necessity without Anderson around.</li><li> What goes around comes back around, as Kenny Omega's divisive leadership of the Bullet Club has led to both Tama Tonga questioning his loyalty to the Club and Cody Rhodes making a play for his spot as the leader. But while Cody is the obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a>, with his and Kenny's feud over the top spot with the ROH/Elite unit caught in the middle taking center stage, Tama Tonga has been maintaining the core of Bullet Club, both in heel mentality and in unison, assembling an increasingly powerful force with the "Bullet Club OG" unit in New Japan. What cemented Tama as this trope was the pull-apart brawl between Cody and Kenny on <em>BTE</em> episode 93, in which the Tongans and the <em>BTE</em> members both intervened to keep Kenny and Cody apart from each other&#133;except for Tama Tonga, who stayed seated looking at them seated with an unfazed gangster expression on his face as though it wasn't even worth getting involved. Wrestling Dontaku 2018, Bullet Club's five-year anniversary, saw him lead the way when the OG unit pressed the <em>BTE</em> crew into linking up the wolf hands after Kenny chased Cody off the scene, as well as ultimately revealed that, despite Cody attempting to steal credit for the "return of Bone Soldier" and Kenny believing him on Twitter, it was Tama Tonga who Taiji Ishimori reached out to in order to get into NJPW as the <em>new</em> Bone Soldier. Then came the G1 Special in San Francisco. Tama and his family finally made their move to strike out The Elite from Bullet Club, sparking the true civil war &#151; and eventually <em>winning it</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">Dissonant Serenity</a>: Tama Tonga's infamous "zero fucks given" moment, sitting down completely nonplussed during Kenny Omega and Cody Rhodes' pull-apart incident in front of the majority of the Bullet Club, including both OG and <em>BTE</em> members, on <em>BTE</em> episode 93, was the point where the possibility of Tonga rising from the chaos of Kenny and Cody's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided">house-dividing ambitions</a> to become the true leader of Bullet Club went from a fringe chance advocated by BC old-heads to being seen as a very real potential scenario.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution">Divergent Character Evolution</a>: All three of Bullet Club's Cutthroat Era junior heavyweight competitors were quite similarly earnest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a> in outside promotions just prior to joining NJPW as part of The Club. During their team-up, however, they completely diverged &#151; Eagles remained largely the same guy in a heel stable, Ishimori has absorbed stock heel tropes, and Phantasmo has done a complete 180&deg; turn into an absolute jerkass heel, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio">Freudian Trio</a> with a clear dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a>.

Anderson and Tonga also had been faces at the time before they joined him in forming the group.</li><li> Similarly, AJ Styles was a long time face even when he left TNA and portrayed a face on the independent circuit, so it was a surprise to some to see him be a heel and join Bullet Club. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor">still wrestles as a face</a> while representing the Club in America as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">The Face</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief">Dragon-in-Chief</a> of the club, making him also something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a>. The latter trope would be played straight in the beginnings of his WWE team-up with Anderson and Gallows, before he ultimately turned full heel to beat up John Cena. After turning face separately over time, the three reunited in another heel turn in 2019.</li><li> Once a long time fun-loving face in love with Japan to the point of learning the language and getting a home there, Kenny Omega is now an arrogant <em>gaijin</em> mercenary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cobra">Cobra</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Wesker</a> fusion whose primary motivations are for money, championships, and (formerly) "cleaning out the crap" in the Junior Division. His gradual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> as the leader of the Elite side of Bullet Club has tipped him back in the other direction with the addition of the belief that he carries a world-changing vision of wrestling.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialMarkings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialMarkings">Facial Markings</a>: Tonga and Loa cover their face with paint as did Gallows. Devitt, Anderson, and the Bucks on occasion as well. When Devitt became Finn B&aacute;lor in the WWE, he would continue painting his face and body when wrestling as "the Demon King." Gallows stopped donning paint of any kind for years since returning to WWE with Anderson, all the way up until they rebranded as The OC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FrankieKazarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FrankieKazarian">Frankie Kazarian</a>, who joined Bullet Club by turning his back on old partner Christopher Daniels to help Adam Cole retain the ROH World title.

AJ then throws the other Buck up over his shoulder to spike the tombstone. Then the holding Buck gives the victim to AJ who sets him up for the Styles Clash, but AJ doesn't drop him until after both Bucks superkick the poor guy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird">Flipping the Bird</a>: The Tongans will often taunt foes both direct and distant with a middle finger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish">Foreign Culture Fetish</a>: The Japanese lettering and fond NJPW references from The OC are more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> than anything that would be strictly of this trope. Chase Owens, who is clearly a product of the Southern United States, and Yujiro Takahshi, the first Japanese member of Bullet Club, both milking the "honorary Tongans" label for all its worth in the first half of 2018, is clearly this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel">Foreign Wrestling Heel</a>: While the main branch in NJPW was founded on this trope, with Yujiro Takahashi being the first exception, the Latin American branch operating mainly out of CMLL is largely made of Latin Americans, excepting Tama Tonga. However, over the years it hasn't been this trope since more Japanese wrestlers have joined the stable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio">Freudian Trio</a>: The three Junior Heavyweights of the Cutthroat Era have developed into this. Robbie Eagles would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">id</a>, competing with some sense of honor and simply desires to prove himself to the Bullet Club Loyal as well as showcase the heart of Australian pro wrestling, though he would get easily flustered when he couldn't do this. Taiji Ishimori is the ego, whose very moniker comes from the essence of Bullet Club itself, who will cheat, taunt, and ambush foes if necessary but not much beyond that and ultimately has no problem with any of his teammates. El Phantasmo is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">superego</a>, going out of his way to be a dick to non-Bullet Club fans, circumventing rules and conventions at the first sign of opportunity, and even undermining Eagles starting from the moment he was questioned for pulling a fast one on him all the way through to the end of <em>Best of Super Juniors</em>. Ultimately Eagles couldn't take anymore, defecting from Bullet Club to join CHAOS at the conclusion of <em>Southern Showdown</em> in his home nation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemy</a>: Despite the battle lines being drawn between the NJPW and ROH contingents in the first half of 2018 thanks to Kenny and Cody's rivalry, the Club themselves still treated each other cordially, even culminating in a big Too Sweet at Wrestling Dontaku that year which the Young Bucks took part in despite the legal troubles surrounding their use of the gesture. This got quickly thrown out the window when the Firing Squad was formed, with the intent to take Bullet Club back from the Elite's antics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>: Kenny Omega went from a faithful young upstart who loved New Japan to a psychotic hitman threatening to kill his rivals to the boss of the biggest heel faction in the company.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">Four Is Death</a>:<ul><li> The Core Four, with Anderson, Fale, Tama, and either Gallows or Devitt depending on the time.</li><li> The Dream Team, with Omega, Cole, and The Bucks, putting together The Elite (Omega/Bucks) and Superkliq (Cole/Bucks) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">power trios</a> into one&#133;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">dream team</a>.</li><li> The Golden Elite, with Omega, the Bucks, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi">Kota Ibushi</a> of all people, have formed this as the leaders of the face-leaning tweener incarnation Bullet Club Elite.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">Fun Personified</a>: Kenny was this before joining the club, and only became an evil version upon turning heel and joining them, before reverting back to playing this straight over time with The Elite.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Fun with Acronyms</a><ul><li> <strong>G</strong>uerrillas <strong>o</strong>f <strong>D</strong>estiny, the name of the Tonga brothers' tag team.</li><li> <strong>G</strong>allows' <strong>O</strong>rganization for <strong>N</strong>ether <strong>A</strong>rea <strong>D</strong>iseases and the <strong>O</strong>ctogenarian <strong>L</strong>eisure <strong>D</strong>estination <strong>F</strong>or <strong>A</strong>ging <strong>R</strong>ehabilitation <strong>T</strong>reatment, Anderson and Gallows' parodies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingDoesntPay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingDoesntPay">Wrestling Doesn't Pay</a> based on attacks they conducted which they then used to mock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay">The New Day</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHairEvilHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHairEvilHair">Good Hair, Evil Hair</a>: When Kenny Omega joined them as the Cleaner, he drastically changed his hair, dying it a mix of black and gray.

Five members of their team would label their next T-shirt releases on Pro Wrestling Tees as being their "final" BC affiliated shirts, as well as strongly hint (or outright confirm in Cody's case) on Twitter that their time with BC was a thing of the past. This culminated in the entire team's announcement, while taping <em>Talk is Jericho</em> at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> Rock 'n' Wrestling Rager at Sea</em>, that they were all going by The Elite as a group and were no longer affiliated with Bullet Club.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>: Since the reformation of the Golden Lovers, Kota Ibushi has begun teaming with Bullet Club in multi-man matches, including those where Kenny isn't present. His status as to whether he was a member or not was clarified with the formation of the Golden Elite, where Kenny stated that despite him and the Young Bucks still being a part of Bullet Club, the membership did not extend to Ibushi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead">Hard Head</a>: Fale, no surprises there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>: Devitt had his when he faced Ryusuke Taguchi in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown">Loser Leaves NJPW</a> match, renouncing his cheating ways and refusing the Young Bucks' help.

This accounted for the Club's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">Heel&#150;Face Revolving Door</a> in 2015, as just about every American promotion that booked Bullet Club members that year, including Ring of Honor and Global Force Wrestling, did so as faces, whereas they have always been a heel group to some degree or another in their main stomping grounds in NJPW.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>: Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks were a prime case of this by the end of 2018. The Bucks caused trouble with Prince Devitt in his last match, helped bring in Omega as a new member during Karl Anderson and AJ Styles' run, then assisted Omega in ousting Styles and convincing Anderson to concede direction to Kenny. This convoluted plot enabled them to quietly take the power of Bullet Club and use it as the personal army for Omega's "Change the World" agenda, with said agenda including the Bucks bringing their indie friends into the Club and its lore through a Ring of Honor expansion. As a consequence of this, however, the biggest internal threats the Club has ever had, in the form of Adam Cole, then Cody Rhodes, were brought in by The Elite themselves, and while they were able to nip Cole in the bud early, they (particularly Kenny) actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">poked at Cody and drove him to his treachery</a> and didn't realize it until he was setting them against each other and claiming leadership. Furthermore, the other men they brought in, Marty Scurll and Adam "Hangman" Page, have proven to be very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a> characters in this crisis situation, and the core members of Bullet Club, represented by day-one OG members Tama Tonga and Bad Luck Fale, became increasingly skeptical about everything involving The Elite. By the time Cody and Kenny finally began to patch up their issues, the Fifita clan members had already hatched a plan to attack Kenny and everyone who sided with him to conclude the <em>G1 Special in San Francisco</em>. Their own machinations to take over Bullet Club have smacked them right back in the nose in 2017-2018, ultimately resulting in them losing Bullet Club. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in that they bowed out of Bullet Club gracefully when it became clear they no longer controlled it, walking away with The Elite as a full faction.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround">I Have the High Ground</a>: Matt and Nick's specialty.

Because one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming">mistakenly announced him as Tama Tonga</a> one time and that pissed him off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: Since launching the Civil War, the heel side including the Tongans and Taiji Ishimori have been identified as Bullet Club OG to offset Kenny Omega's tweener side in Bullet Club Elite. Except they don't really call themselves Bullet Club OG much because they seem to favor insisting that they and they alone are Bullet Club to begin with, framing the conflict as simply Bullet Club vs. The Elite. Even <em>Sports Illustrated</em> went along with it when they published their interview with Tama after the G1 Special. Ultimately they were proven right, as The Elite didn't put up much of a fight for the BC name, conceding it via podcast on Chris Jericho's cruise 3&frac12; months later without ever getting a major pin on Bullet Club.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNickname">Ironic Nickname</a>: Ironic in the sense that you wouldn't expect things to end up that way, rather than named that way from the start. Still, going by his independent/shoot appearances and eventual return to WWE, the character name of Anderson's larger counterpart is actually <em>Luke</em> Gallows&#151;Doc is short for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Director Of Chaos</a></em>, his position in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AcesAndEights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AcesAndEights">Aces &amp; Eights</a> before it was forced to disband.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a>: Part of what defined The Elite's era was this. While the start of Kenny's leadership showed that they were still as tight with the rest of the group and even beyond that, he made no secret about how he prioritized himself and the Young Bucks more than the other members. Over time, the Elite's various ROH affiliates who later joined the group (Cole, Cody, Scurll, Page) only continued to overshadow the homegrown NJPW talent, eventually triggering the inevitable split between the Elite and OG factions.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropes K through Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>: Anderson and Omega stood out as this.

Namely their petty bickering with each other over leadership while at the same time both constantly deemphasizing their loyalty to Bullet Club as a whole behind the scenes. Not only were these things the main source of ire that sparked the Fifita clan's decision to mutiny, they also provided the perfect opening for Jay White to capitalize, with Kenny's invitation to White to join BC under his leadership resulting directly in White's capture of Omega's IWGP United States Championship. Which then led to The Elite's leadership issues only getting worse, the Tongans being able to consolidate the force of BCOG in the background, and White swimming into a burial of Hangman Page before moving on to disrupt CHAOS from the inside. All of which culminated in The Elite being effectively kicked out of Bullet Club in San Francisco (even though they put up an empty fight to keep the name for a few months) and then Switchblade defecting from CHAOS at King of Pro Wrestling to become The Club's new top ace and taking CHAOS's legendary managers with him. With Jay White, The Guerrillas of Destiny, Taiji Ishimori, and El Phantasmo having all captured IWGP titles for a unified heel BC since then, and Tama Tonga even organizing the first ever Bullet Club Block Party and promising more to come, it's safe to say that the strong and Machiavellian identity of Bullet Club is back with a vengeance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!</a>: Speaking of that return to Machiavellian Bullet Club, El Phantasmo overstepped his boundaries in that role to the point of being the primary catalyst to the defection of Robbie Eagles. In the beginning of the <em>Best of Super Juniors</em> tour, Phantasmo and Eagles were getting along just fine, playing off each other seamlessly in mocking their opponents; even before that, Robbie got along famously with the man who recruited him to be his teammate the year before, Taiji Ishimori. After Phantasmo pulled a cheap trick on Eagles to beat him in their B-Block match, however, things started going downhill. Eagles was crestfallen at being deceived by a teammate like that, and this was the beginning of his coming to terms with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Bullet Club's guerrilla tactics clashing with his personal values</a>. Then Phantasmo directly interfered to help him defeat Will Ospreay, who had a friendly past with both men prior to joining BC and would've overtaken Phantasmo's leading spot in the block at the time, which Eagles immediately deduced had been done in self-interest. Upset with being questioned, Phantasmo continued to poke at Eagles on the sly through the rest of the tournament, and wrote him off as a tag team partner in favor of Ishimori despite Robbie being key to BC's victory over Roppongi 3K to set up their tag team title match. Finally, in a very similar display to Prince Devitt's exodus, ElP interfered in Robbie's Junior Heavyweight title match against Ospreay at Southern Showdown despite Eagles saying not to, causing Eagles to attack ElPand later lose the match. This got the attention of Jay White, who became frustrated toward Eagles for not capitalizing on the opening and tried to get him to help destroy Ospreay after a six-man tag match the following night, ultimately being the straw that broke the camel's back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a>: Their specialty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">Not Me This Time</a>: Played with.

Thankfully for the Club's sake, the Bucks seemed to have the "caring about the others" part taken care of, and Kenny still showed enough loyalty when it counted toward Bullet Club itself for the others to regard him as a good leader&#133;at least until his promotion of the Elite ahead of Bullet Club ran afoul of Tama Tonga during their match at the 27th G1 Climax in 2017. Both Tama and Bad Luck Fale have been increasingly hinting their intent to "take back" the Club from the Elite and their antics ever since, before finally making their move almost a year later heading into G1 28, resulting in Omega and the Elite being ousted in favor of placing Jay White as the frontman, who thus far has acted on the same will as Tama and Fale to return Bullet Club to its unified covenant roots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a><ul><li> The group is known to throw out crotch chops and 2 Sweet signs.

They would happily compete against each other when they had to (such as in tournament situations, for example), then shake hands and raise arms and drink beer together after the bell. The only guy who left during this time, Prince Devitt, left largely of his own accord (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">though The Young Bucks didn't help</a>, what with meddling in his personal grudge match and then attacking him for having a problem with it), and going by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> above, things don't even seem half bad between him and the gang since. One can even stretch storylines to posit the idea that AJ Styles, who joined the same night Devitt left the club and whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Big Bad Duumvirate</a> arrangement with Karl Anderson went seamlessly for over a year and a half, had been supported by the club since the closing stretches of his run with TNA&#151;as in, before he even <em>could</em> join them in New Japan. Say what you will about their tactics in New Japan, but they were certainly a closer knit crew than any other stable Styles and Doc Gallows have ever been a part of. Of course, that was all prior to New Year's Dash 2016, when Kenny Omega proceeded to forcefully eject AJ, declare himself the new leader (as in, overriding <em>Anderson</em>), and position himself above the Junior Heavyweight ranks by challenging Shinsuke Nakamura for the IC title.</li><li> Subverted since then, thanks to Bullet Club's interactions in the time between Styles' ejection from Bullet Club (which Omega orchestrated) and his WWE debut. Aside from the endless B&aacute;lor Club teasing and occasional boasting about the Elite, the other Bullet Club members openly supported him in his final independent appearances. AJ and Doc still teamed up in a match in Georgia days after the ejection; the Club's Twitter account along with a couple of members expressed that AJ was "always a brother" and that kicking him out was an "executive decision"; and finally, Gallows &amp; Gun and the Young Bucks shared a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq">Curtain Call-esque</a> moment with AJ in his final ROH appearance at an autograph signing the night before the Rumble. Of course, Kenny had no part of this.</li><li> Anderson and Gallows' first order of business upon debuting in WWE has been to reunite with Styles and back him up against Roman Reigns, and later against John Cena. (Hilariously, the Bucks "forgave" AJ on Twitter after this, while Kenny reconsidered his opinion after AJ won the WWE World Championship.) Later, Kenny finally cemented himself as one of these by hitting Devitt and Styles' finishing moves in succession before his own to win the G1 Climax, then throwing down the G1 Climax flag to wave the Bullet Club flag instead. This kicked off one of the greatest months in the collective history of Bullet Club. (Sadly, it was about the last time Kenny played to this trope.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>: They've been increasingly running on this.

However, The Elite had been skirting the line as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">tweeners</a> for quite some time by that point, and the too-sweet and villainous Bullet Club identity was a popular ideal in its own right for its sense of unity, gritty cool factor, and continued respect to past leaders Devitt and Styles, almost akin to a heel version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">Toretto family</a>.

every other NJPW wrestler's existence difficult while questing to capture all the titles and dominate the company &#151; which is precisely what the Tongans, their recruits, and the fans who support

title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: Anything involving leadership transfers (or attempts at such) would become this.<ul><li> It was <em>Invasion Attack</em> 2014. Devitt had been defeated in a career match and it looked as if Bullet Club has been badly weakened with the loss of their leader. However, the following match, AJ Styles appeared and attacked Kazuchika Okada, revealing himself as the newest member of the group. The next month Yujiro would betray Okada and CHAOS and join the Bullet Club, enabling AJ to win the IWGP Heavyweight title and establish the Bullet Club as the most powerful faction in all of NJPW.</li><li> Despite Kenny Omega and AJ Styles losing both their matches at <em>Wrestle Kingdom 10</em>, the two appeared united the following day at <em>New Year Dash</em> 2016, facing CHAOS members Shinsuke Nakamura and YOSHI-HASHI. Omega pinned Nakamura to win the match, doing what Styles couldn't do the night before. As Styles celebrated on the turnbuckle, Omega did the same&#133;only to suddenly hit Styles with his One Winged Angel finisher, effectively betraying the leader of the Club. Their stablemates came out, the Young Bucks attempting to reason with Omega as Anderson, Gallows and Hall checked on Styles. Just when things appeared to have been smoothed over, Omega and the Bucks triple-superkick Styles, to the surprise of the rest of the Bullet Club&#133; whom Omega quickly convinced to follow him as their leader instead of Styles. Cue the Bullet Club laying a beatdown on Styles, with Omega and the Bucks hitting him with the Stereo Superkicks/Styles Clash combo for the exclamation point.</li><li> <em>New Beginning in Sapporo</em> 2018 Day 2 saw Cody attack Kenny Omega with the tacit support of Hangman Page following Omega's loss to Jay White. However, the real "Wham" here did not come from Bullet Club itself, as Marty Scurll didn't seem to go with it, the Young Bucks had already left the scene, and the non-Elite affiliated members were nowhere to be found. The "Wham" came from Kenny's longtime tag team partner/best friend/Golden Lover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi">Kota Ibushi</a> rushing out to make the save, then embracing the Bullet Club leader in the middle of the ring.</li><li> The next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> that was all about Bullet Club would come from the 2018 <em>G1 Special in San Francisco</em>, when following Omega and Cody's grudge-closing match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and King Haku joined Omega and the Young Bucks on the stage to show support with wolf hands&#133;only to suddenly attack Omega and the Bucks, laying them out in and around the ring&#133;along with Marty Scurll&#133;along with Hangman Page&#133;along with "honorary Tongans" Yujiro Takahashi and Chase Owens when they came down to make peace&#133;and along with Cody when he decided to attack the Tongans instead of Omega with the chair they offered him. The Tongans, wearing brand new BC "Firing Squad" T-shirts, have launched the true Civil War, declaring themselves (along with anyone who sides with them) to be the real Bullet Club. Also, Cody and Kenny are finally good again, uniting the entire <em>BTE</em> contingent.</li><li> And then came <em>King of Pro Wrestling</em> 2018. Hiroshi Tanahashi had just beaten Jay White to keep his <em>Wrestle Kingdom</em> main event briefcase, and was promptly attacked by Jay and his manager Gedo in typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">Sore Loser</a> heel behavior. However, shocking enough on its own, Kazuchika Okada, who White and Gedo had recently betrayed as the leader of CHAOS, ran out to stop his in-stable enemies from crippling his longtime rival Tanahashi. When Okada found himself with an opportunity to strike at Gedo, fellow CHAOS member Jado came out to broker peace between Okada and Gedo&#133;and then Bullet Club OG, coming fresh off the latest in a string of victories over BC Elite as well announcing a new junior tag team partner for Ishimori, came out to the ring, walking slowly and menacingly with an unknown agenda. They converged around the ring, surrouding Gedo, Jado, and Okada; then Fale held Gedo in place as BCOG told Okada to hit him, and Ishimori held Jado to stop him from intervening. Okada hesitated, finally decided to run the ropes to come at Gedo&#133;only for Tama Tonga to instantly betray him with a Gun Stun. The Tongans, Ishimori, Gedo, and Jado all proceeded to stomp away at Okada, before presenting his carcass to Jay White, who had been knocked outside the ring. White came back in the ring, all involved threw up the Turkish Wolf hand gesture passed down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq">The Kliq</a> to The Club, then White finished off the assault with a Blade Runner to Okada, before they all linked hands in the "grounded" version of the handsign, cementing the rebuild of Bullet Club without The Elite.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildSamoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildSamoan">Wild Samoan</a>: Averted with the Tongans.

Shown best in their breakout of BCOG from Kenny Omega and BC Elite; when they became frustrated with the antics of The Elite, they spent almost a year surveying the territory, deciding whether they would call their own shot regarding the future of Bullet Club, and planning out how to do so, before they finally did it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> The Briscoe Brothers, however the Bullet Club did not believe the Hammerstein Ballroom to be a worthy arena nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> to be a worthy promotion.</li><li> Unlike the other Bullet Club top members who challenged Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight title, Omega became a worthy respected rival rather than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a> to Okada. It helps that they both had the same vision for New Japan and were basically fighting for themselves and their stables to take the lead.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: They were prepared to destroy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis">Maria Kanellis</a> along with the rest of The Kingdom if she even teased stepping in the ring. Anderson and Gallows eventually hit her with a Magic Killer, even if Karl didn't look too happy afterward.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">Writing Around Trademarks</a>:<ul><li> Doc Gallows combines both names he used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> (Luke Gallows) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> (DOC). It's unclear whether he would actually <em>need</em> to do so for an overseas promotion like New Japan, but keeping bases covered never hurt anyone.</li><li> The spin-off faction in WWE consisting of Styles, Anderson and Gallows is simply called The Club. WWE social media name-dropped the Bullet Club when the latter two made their debut. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> seems to care just little about trademarks, though, referring to them mockingly as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">Pull-It Club</a> while making it sound as similar to Bullet Club as he can whenever given the chance. When Styles appeared on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a>'s show on the WWE Network, they did mention the group by name, although the two joked that the WWE would end up renaming it the Mullet Club. When they reconvened in 2019, they became known as The OC.</li><li> Due to his situation with WWE, Cody Rhodes is technically not allowed to be referred to with his last name. As such, he's solely referred to by his first name, Cody, in promotions with national TV deals in the US.</li><li> A gesture example which may actually be helping the overall story: the Young Bucks' antics on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BeingTheElite">Being the Elite</a></em> led to them imposing a storyline Cease &amp; Desist on the "Too Sweet" gesture, which ended up turning into reality when the ROH group "invaded" Monday Night RAW. As such, the Club members affiliated with the Elite<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21wi2w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21wi2w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21wi2w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Cody, Marty and Hangman</span> have begun using the "One Sweet" &#151; basically the "Too Sweet" with the pinky finger kept down. The rest of the Club still uses the "Too Sweet", since the C&amp;D was on the Bucks specifically rather than the entire Bullet Club, and as seen with Stephen Amell, Cody changes his gesture based on whether or not the Elite are present.</li><li> The above actually played into how the Too Sweet has been used by the Bullet Club since summer 2018. While it is still thrown up traditionally from time to time, the Firing Squad/Cutthroat Era incarnation of the group opts to invert the gesture while dragging it closer to the ground whenever linking hands. Tama has described this as keeping things "grounded". They're also far more likely to do the gesture while linking hands than as a singular display to spectators, which also fits their mode as a team of heels and hearkens back to how Bullet Club originally displayed it in the Prince Devitt era (and how the reunited "OC" group in 2019 WWE does it).</li><li> Speaking of which, after being reaffirmed as Bullet Club members by Tama himself following the exodus of The Elite at the hands of G.o.D Firing Squad, how do the boys re-brand themselves in a second attempt at a WWE takeover while still slyly confirming their Bullet Club ties under Vince's banner? "The official, the original, the only club that matters."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily">Wrestling Family</a><ul><li> Matt and Nick Jackson.</li><li> Tama is also the adopted son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Meng" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Meng">King Haku</a> and brother of Camacho, who he later brought into the club as Tanga Loa, and Hikuleo. In addition to this, he and Fale are cousins.</li><li> Doc Gallows is married to Amber O'Neal.</li><li> Cody Hall is the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a>.</li><li> Cody Rhodes is the son of "The American Dream" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a> and the younger brother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust">Goldust</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Kenny Omega's argument for betraying AJ Styles and ousting him from the Club, usurping the leadership in the process at New Year's Dash 2016. Omega states that Styles had failed time and time again in big title matches and that he was therefore fired from the Bullet Club. This marks the first time anyone has been outright kicked out of the Club. The second one involved Adam Cole.</li></ul></div><hr>
