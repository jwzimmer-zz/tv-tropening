Set in Milborough (a fictional suburb of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto">Toronto</a>, Ontario, Canada), the strip's main characters are the Patterson family: mild-mannered parents Elly and John and their children Michael, Elizabeth, and April. All but April are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow">based closely on Johnston's real-life family</a>: herself, (now ex-) husband Rod, and children Aaron and Katie. Johnston claimed that she created April because she wanted another baby, but knew it wasn't practical for her in real life.</p><p>The strip is perhaps best-known for the fact that, unlike most comic strips, it did not use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>, and took place more or less in real time for most of its run. Michael and Elizabeth were a young child and a toddler at the strip's beginning, and by the end had grown into adults, with Michael married and raising his own children while Elizabeth married at the end of the strip. Youngest child April was born 11 years into the strip's run and was roughly 16 at the strip's conclusion.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In its heyday, the strip was also celebrated for its realism, eschewing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom">Sitcom</a> stereotypes in favor of a nuanced, relatable look at typical adult, child and teen concerns. A storyline in which a supporting character came out as gay cemented this reputation, as well as various stories dealing with prejudice, bullying, the mentally and physically handicapped, theft, cheating and abuse. The Pattersons were often shown as a good, "normal" family, often forced to deal with others from broken homes or worse situations.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same intimacy that allowed Johnston such insight also takes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">her shortcomings and shortsightedness</a>, something the author herself (a proudly self-described "Child of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>") has acknowledged. This became steadily more apparent in the strip's final years, as &mdash; concurrent with Johnston's discovery that her husband was cheating on her and the subsequent messy divorce &mdash; the strip wound down and the characters all began settling into domestic bliss rather than continue being exciting young adults, resulting in <em>two</em> of the three Patterson kids marrying their childhood sweethearts due to massively contrived circumstances. Much speculation ensued from disappointed fans over this development, in particular whether or not Johnston may have been attempting to deal with her personal trials by creating the life she wanted for herself through the strip.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Starting in September 2007, flashbacks to the early years of the strip were interspersed into the present-day plotlines. The last regular daily strip of <em>For Better or For Worse</em> was published on August 30, 2008, and the last Sunday strip was published the next day. Though Johnston had announced her retirement from the strip entirely, she relented, largely due to the collapse of her marriage removing one of her key motivations for retiring. To ramp down her workload, starting in September 2008, Johnston began in effect to retell the strip from the beginning, through what she described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback">"new-runs"</a>. For some time, the strip consisted of a mixture of reprints from the early years with newly drawn strips also set during the era when Michael was a young child and Elizabeth was a toddler. In 2010, the new-run strips were phased out, and the strip remained in syndication but almost exclusively with straight reprints. As of 2012, the <em>For Better or For Worse</em> strips appearing in newspapers generally correspond exactly to those which originally appeared 29 years before. Only rarely does this pattern change, with an occasional new strip being drawn to ensure that holiday-themed strips appear on the relevant holiday.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This strip includes examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair">'80s Hair</a>: Elly averted these styles for the better part of a decade until in one arc in 1989, she got the idea to cut off her long straight hair, as Georgia had done. But when she actually went to get it done, one thing led to another and she ended up getting a body perm instead (from a hairdresser with an edgy '80s girl mullet). Elly was not happy with the result, but John claimed to like it (though it is possible he was just being kind or diplomatic), giving her second thoughts. Connie also liked the perm, but Elizabeth's frank (if unwelcome) comparison to the Bride of Frankenstein seemed to settle the issue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Johnston drew Elly with some curl in her hair for about four months; she started drawing it straight again in September of that year and never gave her that look again.</span><ul><li> Michael&#146;s second girlfriend, Rhetta Blum, arguably counts as another example of this,especially in her early appearances.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>:<ul><li> At one point, Lawerence and Michael create and act as superheroes named after bodily functions and noises.

When Elizabeth tells on her, Elly is too busy laughing to immediately say anything.</li><li> When Mrs. Kelpfroth finds out that Michael wrote about her and her husband being terrible neighbors, she admits the title "Knock on the Ceiling Twice" is clever since they've been banging on the ceiling.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> When April was a toddler, she wandered into the background and opened the gate that led to the nearby river. She had asked her parents she could go outside, and they were too busy to pay attention to her. She then fell into the river and went under while calling for her mother. Farley <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dives in and grabs April's hoodie, keeping her head above the water, just as Elly and John realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">they can't find April</a> and see the duo fighting the currents after Edgar leads them there. They manage to pull out April and Farley doing an impromptu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfPeople">Chain of People</a>, with April apologizing for nearly dying. Liz comes, checking on her little sister...and notices Farley has collapsed. He died from the cold water giving him shock</span>.</li><li> The Kelpfroths setting their apartment building on fire by accident, due to their smoking habits. Everyone barely gets out in time, and the firefighters chide Michael for going back in to rescue his book because it's not worth his life.</li><li> Then there's the arc where Kortney is goofing off at work and stealing inventory. When April catches her on a chatroom during work hours, Kortney threatens to knock her teeth out. Shaken, April tells her grandfather, who tells her mother. Elly is still in denial, and April gives her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">Calling the Old Man Out</a> about keeping a liar and opportunist on payroll. Elly lies awake at night, and John tells her she has to fire Kortney for threatening their daughter. It takes until Elly is on vacation for Moira to fire Kortney and bust her for everything she did.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>: The Pattersons never retain anything they learn, such as Elly's temporary bout of appreciating her husband after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaBomb">he and Phil nearly died on a camping trip</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Gone Horribly Wrong</a>, or Michael realizing that "bad things don't just happen to <em>other</em> people".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed">Altar the Speed</a>: Liz basically drops all commitments and her career to get married to Anthony at the end of the strip's run.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>: Becky becomes one throughout high school after getting tastes of talent-based fame.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>: An unfortunate subtext.

The fact that she apparently gets postpartum depression is glossed over by Anthony; when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">abandons, then completely rejects</a> her own daughter, it's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious</a>.</li><li> April's sometimes-friend Becky dreams of becoming a star, like the rest of her friends. When she rises to fame, she becomes progressively bitchy, though she does have her occasional sympathetic moments.</li><li> Liz showed some ambition, becoming a teacher at a First Nation village, learning their culture and bonding with her students. She gave all of it up for Anthony, though according to the epilogue she did resume her work, presumably in her hometown.</li><li> Perhaps rather tellingly, the only one who's shown to have achieved her ambition is the black sheep of the family, April.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>: Grandpa Jim's stroke appears to have left him mentally damaged, but he is in fact just fine mentally. He just can't <em>speak</em>. So we get strips where he mentally begs people to stop babying him, but can only communicate with a loud noise that people take as him thanking them for babying him (or, in one memorable strip, his own grandson calling him 'crazy'). <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gocomics.com/forbetterorforworse/2007/02/07">Yeah...<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>: Three incarnations over a sixteen-year span, each capturing a different era of the comic it was adapting:<ul><li> <em>The Bestest Present</em>, a one-off 1985 half-hour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a> by Atkinson Film-Arts which aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CTV">CTV</a> (following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> trend of adapting popular comic strips into Christmas specials). Michael and Elizabeth are still young children, and are even voiced by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> inspirations, Aaron and Katie Johnston. (Elly and John are voiced by professional voice actors, but Lynn's then-husband Rod cameos as a mailman.)</li><li> A series of six half-hour specials in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the early '90s</a>, produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LacewoodProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LacewoodProductions">Lacewood Productions</a>, which also aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CTV">CTV</a>. Three of these were holiday specials (including <em>another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a>, a Halloween Special, and a Valentine's Day Special), and three were "normal" episodes. Michael is in high school and Elizabeth is a preteen, with infant April now completing the Patterson family. Given that he was the right age for a lot of juicy storylines, the specials tended to focus more on Michael over the rest of the family.</li><li> A two-season, sixteen-episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedSeries">Animated Series</a> which aired 2000-01 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon">Teletoon</a>, produced by Funbag Animation. Although produced by a different studio, several of the voice actors from the Lacewood specials returned for this series, which helped to provide some continuity with them. The show featured a unique variation on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeShorts">Three Shorts</a> format: each episode would focus on a specific theme, introduced in a short live-action segment by none other than Lynn Johnston herself. (And yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">for the sake of completion</a>, one of these themed episodes was indeed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>.) We would then see one example of this theme in a six-minute cartoon segment depicting each "era" of the comic:<ul><li> The Early Years: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, the same period as <em>The Bestest Present</em>.</li><li> The Growing Years: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The early '90s</a>, the same period as the Lacewood specials.</li><li> The Later Years: The present day as of the production of the cartoon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>. Michael is a young adult, attending university (or recently graduated) and in a serious relationship with Deanna Sobinski (they would marry in late 2001). Elizabeth is in her late teens (and, amusingly, dating her eventual husband Anthony), and April is a rambunctious child doing her best to exhaust her aging parents.</li></ul></li><li> The animated series would presage the "new-run" treatment the comic itself would later receive by applying Johnston's modern-day drawing style retroactively to the "Early Years" and "Growing Years" segments (contrast how the characters <em>actually</em> appeared at the time in the contemporary animated specials). Each cartoon segment was preceded by a slideshow presentation of a contemporary Sunday strip, in a similar function to the "Quickie" segments on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToWorseProblems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToWorseProblems">Appeal to Worse Problems</a>: <em>Very</em> frequently used to shut up character's trivial complaints.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: When April tells Elly she has proof that Kortney threatened her for being on a chatroom when she was supposed to be working, Elly is in denial. April asks Elly, "Why do you keep defending her?" Elly weakly says she knows Kortney could do great things as an achiever. April snarks that she's already achieved being paid for doing nothing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>: Leading to Lynn Johnston having to consciously imitate her earlier style for the post-2008 "new-runs".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePharmacology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePharmacology">Artistic License &#150; Pharmacology</a>: Deanna's claim that she, a licensed pharmacist, didn't know switching birth control meds would leave you more fertile between cycling off the old and starting the new. (The dual result of this "oopsie" was their first child, Meredith &mdash; conception occurred on their honeymoon &mdash; and the fan theory that she deliberately did this.) This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> later when Elizabeth's friend Candace points out how unlikely it would be for a pharmacist to make such a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gocomics.com/forbetterorforworse/2002/02/18">mistake<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a>: Of Elizabeth, by a coworker, from which Anthony rescues her. Unfortunately (especially given the strip's by-then iconic reputation for nuanced realism) Johnson initially chose to use the situation solely as a device to give <em>Anthony</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment to kickstart their romance. Thus an immediate aftermath that focused, not on Elizabeth struggling with her trauma or even reporting the assault to the police, but Anthony seemingly taking advantage of her vulnerability to demand she wait for him to escape his horrible marriage. When <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">the inevitable reader backlash</a> erupted, Johnson hastily cobbled together a followup in which Howard the rapist is arrested and tried... in which the focus is almost solely on on Anthony's chivalrous support in Liz' time of need.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>: Elly Patterson. In fact, the entire Patterson family was modeled after the Johnston family, with each character's first name being the middle name of their real life counterpart &mdash; except Elly, who was named after a childhood friend of Lynn Johnston who died at a young age, and April, who was created to fulfill Johnston's desire for a third child that she never actually had.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a>: The (long) series in Mtigwaki where Elly narrates about the Natives' lives; <a class="urllink" href="https://fborfw.com/strip_fix/storyline/shannon-stands-up/">Shannon's speech<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about the disabled. Regarding the latter, however, see YMMV for whether or not that was an anvil that needed to be dropped.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a>: James Allen, the offspring of Anthony and Elizabeth, shown only in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">final strip</a> to make it clear to all readers that this much-discussed couple will be happy together. Not quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Dead Guy Junior</a>, as James is born in time for his great-grandfather and namesake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition">Jim to hold him before finally expiring</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">Babies Make Everything Better</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played with</a>: Anthony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invokes</a> this by pressuring Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to have a child, despite her repeatedly telling him that she's not ready yet. He goes so far as to outright <strong>lie</strong> to her, promising that she can go back to work after recovering from the birth and he'll be primary caretaker, while fully expecting that once she's popped the baby out, mysterious female hormones will kick in and make her give up her career in a heartbeat for becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife">housewife</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Didn't work</a>. He flat-out admits this while recounting this to Liz later, seeing absolutely nothing wrong with this, and honestly believing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">its failure means something is wrong with</a> <strong>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</strong>, rather than him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog">Big Friendly Dog</a>: Farley was friendly to everyone and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">died saving April's life.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization">Bowdlerization</a>: In the lead-up to Michael and Deanna's wedding, Deanna's mother threw one more massive hissy fit about Michael allowing Lawrence, an openly gay man, to be his best man. However, unlike the earlier Lawrence stories, an alternative storyline was also circulated to papers that deemed their readership too sensitive to the subject that changed the fight to being concerned with a flower arrangement. Notably, both strips used the same art, simply reworking dialog slightly to make both of them work - and in the censored version, Lawrence had provided the flower arrangement, hence he remained relevant.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>:<ul><li> In one strip, the doll Naked Ned gets <a class="urllink" href="http://catalog.fborfw.com/indexid.php?q=9324">flushed down the toilet<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

This can result in the impression that the strip actually takes place in America, apparently in an effort to make it more relatable to American audiences. She makes a point of using American legal expressions during the trial of Howard Bunt, and avoids mentioning that Canadian Thanksgiving is in October.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canada, Eh?</a>: The strip is technically set in Canada, where the author lives, though you might not realize it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaDoesNotExist">Canada Does Not Exist</a>. The only time Johnston really played with it was when she had Michael go to post-secondary school in the mid-sized city London, Ontario, which is only about 300 kilometers west of Toronto, knowing that there would be people who would think that the boy was studying in the British city. Notably, one of her slip-ups had her portray milk being sold in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_bag">plastic bags<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (which is only done in Ontario, Quebec, and parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin). She ended up getting an incredible number of letters over that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CeilingBanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CeilingBanger">Ceiling Banger</a>: The Kelpfroths, Mike and Deanna's downstairs neighbors in their old apartment. To the point where they eventually caused actual damage, which finally gave the landlady (who hated them as much as Mike and Deanna did) the excuse to evict them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a>:<ul><li> The power of family and friends.</li><li> Life is not perfect but <em>for better or for worse</em> things will turn out fine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a>: Early comics, as shown by some of the reruns Johnston has done, were gag-a-day strips with the same general range of humor as <em>Marvin</em> or <em>Baby Blues</em>. Later on, the strip developed a serious streak where the jokes would be mild to nonexistent for brief periods; for example, the coming-out story often had very gentle jokes in the last panel at best. The strip went into turnaround mode as it neared the end, ending almost every single strip in a groan-inducing bad pun, no matter how serious the content is supposed to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfPeople">Chain of People</a>: Elly and John do this to pull a toddler April and Farley from the river currents. Elly grabs a branch and holds onto John, who manages to catch April's hoodie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>: Hard to avoid in a strip that uses real-time and various characters age from childhood to adulthood. April moved from a standard goofy kid to a fairly bratty teenager, and Elizabeth went from nerdy and loud to a thoughtful young woman. A few villains later turned up having done a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>. And notably, Elly used to be a fussy, angry, crabby young mother prone to outbursts, and developed into the more calm "voice of reason" of the strip, and John became a lot less of a snarky character (he used to poke fun at Elly constantly, much to her consternation).<ul><li> Candace notably - she is pretty much held up as a deviant girl who acts out... but over the course of the college era, eventually gained a mother figure in the form of her aunt. Becky was April's best friend... then lost that status in high school... but then worked to become April's friend again once she started to mature.</li><li> Michael started off as a bit of a troublemaker in school &mdash; argumentative, a class clown, and a pain. Once he meets Martha at summer camp, he becomes a lot more introspective, thoughtful and sincere.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>: In Mira's early appearances when Deanna brought Mike home to meet her parents, she was called "Eva" and was a perfectly pleasant woman with no hint of the meddlesome control freak she became.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">Child Hater</a>:<ul><li> According to <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se is one.</li><li> The Kelpfroths downstairs are implied to be this as well, since the main thing they complain about is the presence of child's toys and various other child-related items being strewn across the property. Despite this being a rather reasonable complaint in a shared living space, the strip naturally took the view that only people who <em>loathed</em> children would dare ask for a clean property.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>: With the size of the cast, it is perhaps inevitable that certain characters would be written out of the series. However, several simply vanished without an explanation, until rather contradictory prose accounts were written some years later. Iconic examples would be Connie's stepdaughters Molly and Gayle, who vanished without warning after two years of being the focal point of some drama. Averted with Howard, though: she <em>tried</em> doing this but reckoned without the fanbase who <em>wanted</em> to see him get his comeuppance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds">Cleaning Up Romantic Loose Ends</a>: Paving the way for the eventual marriage of Liz and Anthony, Liz's boyfriend Paul cheated on her, and her on-and-off boyfriend Warren started being depicted as a manipulative, unstable quasi-stalker. Meanwhile, Anthony's bitchy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Wife</a> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se left him for another person after years of (justified!) jealousy over Anthony's feelings for Liz, but her final appearance in the comic is less resolution and more of the comic making one last attempt to get the readers to hate her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>: Averted since the characters aged up in real time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">Coming-Out Story</a>: Michael's best friend Lawrence, in a storyline that got the strip pulled from many newspapers, either temporarily or permanently.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">The Complainer Is Always Wrong</a>:<ul><li> Partially inverted; Elly frequently complained and carried on about how horrible and thoughtless her family was, although their crimes weren't always as obvious as was clearly intended.</li><li> The Kelpfroths were horrible neighbors because they chronically complained about Michael and his family, for reasons both valid and invalid. They were also known to repeatedly violate the terms of their lease, so that the landlady could be all gleeful when she finally got an excuse to evict them.</li><li> April, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>, often had the odd opinion out and was meant to be seen as having the <em>wrong</em> opinion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle">Cool Uncle</a>: Elly's musician brother has made a few appearances and the kids just adore him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when he attempts to take them off the parents' hands for a night and he wears himself out trying to get them to bed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">Cordon Bleugh Chef</a>: A lot of the humor of the first few years of the strip was based on the family's dreading meal time owing to Elly's love of cooking stews and casseroles and insistence that they go into gastric distress to prove their love for her. Also, she was known to go on diets and force the whole family to join her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity">Cuteness Proximity</a>: John with baby Lizzie, although he tries to deny it. Elly isn't fooled.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: John in the early days was pretty likely to just make a joke at Elly's expense when she was being particularly fussy or crabby about something. It usually went unappreciated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal">Death by Newbery Medal</a>: Farley's death.

At first readers likely assumed he was his mom's ex-husband Pete. It turned out this wasn't true however. His father came from Brazil, but went back there before he was born. Much later, this was expanded on. Lawrence revealed that he tracked his father down on finding out he was visiting the US, and they finally met. It turned out his parents had been in a very brief relationship when they both worked at a medical relief mission in Central America. While his parents had planned after this to meet up in Canada, his father never arrived. Lawrence learned he had two half-brothers from a later marriage his father had. Lawrence's father apologized for never contacting him or his mother, and it seemed they were going to build a relationship. However, he was not shown again or mentioned.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDissTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDissTrack">The Diss Track</a>: April Patterson composed a ditty aimed at her schoolmate antagonist.

Also one of the major criticisms of Elizabeth's relationship with Anthony: Elizabeth eagerly shed teaching school amid a different culture in exchange for settling down to be as much like her homebody parents as possible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>: Quite a bit. <a class="urllink" href="http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j175/muzition/fbofw_didntgetcold.gif?t=1267471440">Here's<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> one example. Another notable one is when Elly's friend Annie gets pregnant, and it's remarked she conceives "at the drop of a hat." When asked what her husband thinks of this, it's said he's going to "start wearing more hats". A meta-example occurs in the book 'What, Me Pregnant?', which covers Elly's pregnancy with April, but actually starts with the storyline of Elizabeth getting glasses, thus implying that April's conception happened at some point during that storyline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>: The final installment was published August 31, 2008, and revealed what became of the main characters in future years:<ul><li> Main protagonists Elly and John retire to travel, volunteer in the community, and help raise their four grandchildren.</li><li> The Pattersons' son and oldest child, Michael, an author, has four books published and later realizes a lifelong dream with the signing of a film contract. Deanna opens a sewing school and teaches Robin how to cook. Meredith enters dance and theater.</li><li> Older daughter Elizabeth, who has married longtime boyfriend Anthony Caine, continues to teach. She and Anthony have a child, James Allen, presumably named in honor of his great-grandfather Jim Richards. Anthony manages Mayes Motors and its various related businesses, introduces Elizabeth to ballroom dancing, and hopes to eventually open a bed-and-breakfast.</li><li> The younger daughter, April &mdash; presumably graduating from high school in 2009 &mdash; enters college (at an unnamed university) and eventually earns a degree in veterinary medicine. Following her established love of horses, she gets a job with the Calgary Stampede. She eventually establishes herself in western Canada, where she meets her boyfriend.</li><li> Family patriarch James Richards ("Grandpa Jim," Elly's father), a widower who had suffered a stroke earlier in the 2000s that left him unable to talk or care for himself, lives to welcome the birth of his fourth great grandson James Allen. In early 2010, at age 89, Jim &mdash; who had other health issues late in his life, including several heart attacks &mdash; dies peacefully in his sleep, his second wife, Iris (who had been his caretaker) at his side.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>: Lynn Johnston <em>tried</em> to do this, bless her heart, with Anthony's shrewish, self-centered ex-wife Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, who was intended to be seen as a icy-hearted, spiteful, and vindictive witch so that readers wouldn't feel bad about Anthony cheating on her. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out that way, since most of her "hateful" behavior towards Liz and Anthony stemmed from things like 1) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWantingKidsIsWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWantingKidsIsWeird">not wanting to have a child</a>, 2) not wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">give up her job and become the sole caretaker</a> for said unwanted child, 3) being angry at Anthony when he went back on his word that she wouldn't be the sole caretaker for said unwanted child, and 4) getting angry at him because she thought he was cheating on her...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">which he was</a>.

In fact, a running mockery of the strip has become that everyone in the Foobiverse must marry the first non-related person of the opposite sex they meet. The last non-"new-run" strips reveal that April moved to the other side of the country and hooked up with an unnamed "country boy", a fact which elicited cheers; the readers just wanted to see one Patterson kid escape the web.</li><li> Supplementary material make this apply to <em>Anthony</em>... with <em>Therese</em>! They knew each other as kids (even younger than when Elizabeth met Anthony) thanks to their father's long-standing business ties.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife">Housewife</a>: Elly Patterson, and seen as the "natural role" of women in the strip, despite Elly hating the job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseFire">House Fire</a>: The December 2006 story arc where Michael, Deanna and their children are forced from their duplex home due to a fire in the downstairs unit (caused by the occupant smoking in bed).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour">Hypocritical Humour</a>: A staple, especially in the strips involving Elly's parenting or home-making skills.<ul><li> One week-long arc had Elly and John flipping out when April wanted to skip eating dinner with them and finish up her homework. After being forced to apologize and join them, Elly lectures about how mealtimes are for them spending time as a family and discussing their day. Cue both parents completely ignoring their daughter after dragging her back into her place.</li><li> One strip had Elly having a conversation with one of her friends about how she loves being a mother and she is always there whenever her children need her, during the entire conversation a five year old Elizabeth repeatedly tries to get her attention, eventually Elly yells back at her "Will you please get lost, I'm trying to have a conversation here!".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>: Michael picked up a huge one when he left Deanna to get their two young children out of the apartment alone during a fire, while he rushed back up to his "writing room" to collect the laptop containing his freshly completed first novel. Even published writers who were fans of the strip criticized this. (Adding exponentially to the surreality, Johnston later admitted she was using the laptop in this story simply as an update for "paper manuscript" and thus hadn't considered backups, the fact that Mike had emailed his mother a copy, etc.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWriteTheThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWriteTheThing">I Just Write the Thing</a>: Johnston has alluded to this in the form of "The Characters Said So", although it may just be trying to deflect criticism.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleLeavening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleLeavening">Impossible Leavening</a>: Elly's attempt to hide a large mass of dough she'd added too much yeast to is foiled when it starts exploding out of the trash can as John comes home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>: Michael's writing "genius", when shown excerpts of his writing are generally regarded as clich&eacute; at best or junk at worst; Anthony's positive traits and suitability as a husband as related by everyone Elizabeth knows.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">Informed Flaw</a>:<ul><li> Anthony's ex-wife Th&eacute;r&egrave;se is given a myriad of informed flaws. She rarely appears in the strip proper, so for the most part we have only Anthony's point of view and the local gossips to provide us with these "facts". The only times we see her acting on any of them are fairly mild and sometimes even justified (i.e. her jealous suspicions that her husband was still obsessed with Liz).</li><li> April is supposedly a rebellious teenager, yet is only occasionally shown talking back to her parents. Note that in the strip's eyes, things like deciding to skip dinner to focus on finishing her homework, insisting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">somebody is stealing from her mother's store and abusing her trust</a>, and reminding them of promises they've completely broken all count as being "defiant".

Perhaps best illustrated by Michael when he witnessed a car accident; unlike his friend Weed, who wanted to help, Michael was more interested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Paparazzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Paparazzi">snapping photos of the wreck</a> for an exclusive story, and became outraged when police shooed him off. He only briefly regretted his actions upon learning his childhood crush <a class="urllink" href="https://fborfw.com/strip_fix/monday-may-6-1996/">Deanna was in one of the cars<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; this did not, however, stop him from insisting that the accident was "fate bringing them back together".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>: Elly gets some with how she treated Kortney. April reports to Elly, with Grandpa Jim backing her up, that Kortney threatened to knock her teeth out for catching her on an adult chatroom. Elly remains in denial and decides to give Kortney a second chance. She finds out several months later that Kortney was stealing from her on a regular basis, including the model trains on display. Fittingly, April helped Moira uncover the evidence and deliver the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IToldYouSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IToldYouSo">I Told You So</a> to her mother.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished">Life Embellished</a>:<ul><li> April was created because Johnston wanted to have another child but wound up not actually doing so.</li><li> Michael and Elizabeth's eventual marriages came despite Johnston's own children having yet to "settle down" at the time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeIsLikeAComma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeIsLikeAComma">Like Is, Like, a Comma</a>: Teenaged April, like, speaks like this, like, often.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse">Like Parent, Like Spouse</a>: Anthony was often compared to John, by other characters and <em>John himself</em>.

Mira went <em>way</em> over the top with her control-freak tendencies where the wedding was concerned. When Michael and Deanna are having the conversation that leads to the private ceremony, Deanna reveals that she was engaged once before, and she accepted his proposal solely because of her mother's insistence. If you read the 'between strips notes' in some of the collections, Deanna's older sister ran off and eloped with her fiancee in the middle of the wedding plans solely because of Mira's Bridezilla-ness; Mira refused to speak to her older daughter for years because of it. It's pretty obvious that Mira really, really wants to plan and execute a fancy wedding, to make up for the five-minute ceremony she had.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a>: When Lawrence comes out to his mother and step-father, the latter reacts by throwing him out of the house, much to Connie's shock and horror.

Kortney retaliates by attempting to sue them for wrongful dismissal, but the lawsuit is quickly thrown out, especially once the cops discover that she assisted in the robbery of a model train in the store a couple of years ago.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWantingKidsIsWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWantingKidsIsWeird">Not Wanting Kids Is Weird</a>: Much of the story of Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and Anthony's marriage was communicated to readers via a week of New Year&#146;s party bathroom gossip, with a group of young women clucking over how awful Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was for having a job and not wanting a baby.

Over time, a distinct "if you're not with the Pattersons, you're against them" theme emerged. Lynn Johnson was on the record as firmly believing in the "not a Patter', don't matter" school of thought, to the extent that she was actually surprised that readers wanted to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Howard</a> convicted for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">going after</a>" Elizabeth, because hey, he wasn't going to bother the Pattersons again, so who cares about any <em>other</em> people he might go after?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster">Pungeon Master</a>: Almost every punchline is a horrible pun like this.

Thus, the band is just a hobby.</li><li> One of Elly's employees, Kortney, is slacking off at work. She threatens April for finding her on a chatroom during store hours; Elly is in denial and can't bring herself to fire Kortney, even when her own husband advises it. She believes that if she just treats Kortney nicely, the lady will become better as an achiever. April snarkily says that the lady has already achieved doing nothing while getting paid. Sure enough, Kortney starts stealing inventory and covering it up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> about them being donations to the local church, using stolen checks and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgedLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgedLetter">Forged Letter</a>. Moira, Elly's second-in-command, eventually takes the initiative to fire Kortney when she and April find that evidence and Elly is on vacation.

But Lynn carefully points out in some of the commentary that "Rod would never say this" if John says something particularly hurtful &mdash; she was creating conflict for the strip.</li><li> Averted in cases like Michael's. His basis (Lynn's young son) was occasionally scolded by <em>complete strangers</em> for being "such a handful", when he was a lot calmer in real life than Michael was. He also did not grow up to be a reporter nor a writer &mdash; he jokes in one documentary that his mom basically suggested he become a reporter, and when he declined to follow her advice, she simply wrote that trait into Michael.</li><li> Lynn Johnston desperately wanted grandchildren, and her kids at the time had none. And so Michael had two, and Elizabeth very quickly became a lot more family-oriented, and was revealed to have given birth in the final strip (her basis finally did breed, to Lynn's joy).</li><li> Played straight examples include Lynn's son seeing a car crash, then discovering that the victim was someone he knew, Lynn's desire for another child (but unwillingness to actually go through the physical struggle yet again) resulting in the birth of April in the comic, and <em>numerous</em> real-life arguments, comments and jokes said by people Lynn knew (such as the time Michael said "don't get your panties in a bunch" to his own mother).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>: Moira is this when helping Elly run the bookstore. She suspects Kortney Krelbutz, their new employee, of stealing. Kortney finds ways to cover up with forged letters and checks, and smirks at Moira when Elly absolves her. So Moira waits until she has evidence, and fires Kortney while Elly is away. Then she presents the proof to Elly, telling her while it's good to be nice, sometimes you need to trust your instincts and follow up on seemingly perfect cover stories.

She uses passive-aggressiveness on her husband, then laments that he never gets the message; wobbles and wrings her hands over punishing her children for misbehaving, then whines that she simply doesn't <em>understand</em> how they could be so rowdy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">Series Continuity Error</a>: A common accusation leveled at the author, over everything from basic fact-checking to apparently being unable to keep elements of her own strip straight, causing character ages, appearances, personalities and even <em>names</em> to flux wildly, particularly in the last few years. She has on occasion openly admitted that her readers keep better track of her continuity than she can be bothered to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">She Is All Grown Up</a>: Elizabeth, on her wedding day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>: <em>Everyone</em> for Liz and Anthony, except April.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>:<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> when Michael is working at a hot dog stand, his boss explains to him that, out of a pack of six hot dogs being sold, only the sixth sale generates profit. All the rest go to overhead. Granted, this really isn't something that only a business major would know, but it actually <em>is</em> nice to see someone explain that not <em>every</em> sale of something equals profit, especially in an animated show.</li><li> Another example in the strip itself, when Michael goes on a business trip to Japan. At one point, Michael is writing his article in the hotel bar, and can happily type away because everyone's surrounding conversation is just white noise to him. The Japanese-speaking people around him have dialogue bubbles filled with kanji; according to Johnston, she wrote the 'small talk' of all the people in English, then consulted with a Japanese friend to translate them properly. Those who know kanji have confirmed that all of this actually does read as real, sensible phrases, rather than random kanji strung together.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">Skewed Priorities</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a>; while John had a legitimate excuse to not talk to toddler April because he was on the phone, Elly was more focused on showing vacation photos as April was asking if she could play outside.

Also occurs with Anthony's two-year-old daughter Francie, who speaks and looks like an exceptionally articulate ten-year-old, and Liz's student Jesse who transforms from an adorable seven-year-old tyke to tall and teenaged in the space of only three years.

Finally, Elly yells, "All right, you can watch television!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a>: Johnston, in an attempt to avoid dating the strip too badly (and probably also to get around syndicate censorship), tries to create her own teenage slang for stuff. Some of these are so ridiculous-seeming that one, the insult "foob", became synonymous with the strip, hence the Fan Nickname. One <a class="urllink" href="http://www.joshreads.com">website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> mocking the strip still sells T-shirts with the phrase "Roadside", an attempt by Johnston to create her own slang for frisky teens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnFavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnFavourite">The Un Favourite</a>: April is treated as if she's a selfish little monster for, you know, her parents having her late in their lives and thus being ready to retire when she's not old enough to kick out of the house. If a person, thing, or activity was supposed to be viewed negatively it's because April <em>adored</em> it. These "negative" acts included things like adoring her ailing grandfather and going out of her way to spend time with him, disapproving of Anthony cheating on his wife with Liz, and finishing her homework.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment">Unishment</a>: April is once sent to her room for misbehaving - and instead takes a nap.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable">The Unpronounceable</a>: Mtigwaki, the First Nation village Liz taught at.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsoundEffect">Unsound Effect</a>: Used frequently.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a>: Often mixes with the wholly invented slang mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> above, where characters will use an Unusual Euphemism that Johnston invented... and then have to explain it by using a more standard euphemism ("Boxcar!").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillainSucksSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillainSucksSong">"The Villain Sucks" Song</a>: April writes a song called "Germy Wormy Jeremy Jones", about a kid who&#146;s been bullying her and her friends.

What makes it worse is that exploiting their children's hard work because they did the least that a human being is supposed to do is seen as a wonderful thing instead of an example of sleaze and evil. Sadly, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> (or truth in comics, as it were).

She says Elly is the boss but also tells her at some point she needs to stop believing in someone who threatened her daughter and is the most likely thief for missing inventory. John says the same thing after Kortney threatens April for finding her on a chatroom during work hours. Eventually, Moira takes action while Elly is on vacation; she finds evidence that Kortney was stealing and fires her on those grounds while showing Elly the proof, including stolen checks and letters. Elly is in shock that she let herself be played for a fool, especially when Moira reminds her that April was a prime witness to this behavior, and April reveals that Kortney's boyfriend stole the model trains that went missing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

In a less depressing vein, April was born because Johnson had wanted (but not had) a third child. Lynn <em>knew</em> it wasn't really practical in real life and said in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> that she did the next best thing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorseWithContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorseWithContext">Worse with Context</a>:<ul><li> In one comic, Michael tells his half-asleep mother that Elizabeth just went outside with her new umbrella and wearing her new boots, which just gets a series of grunts. Then he adds she's <em>only</em> wearing the boots. Elly runs outside to chase down her daughter while a grinning Michael muses that he likes telling the best part last.</li><li> Another strip shows Elizabeth retaliating after Michael puts soap on her toothbrush. When she tells him she used his toothbrush, it doesn't faze Michael in the slightest. Then Elizabeth tells him she didn't use it for her teeth, but for <em>Farley's.</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WringEveryLastDropOutOfHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WringEveryLastDropOutOfHim">Wring Every Last Drop out of Him</a>: Grandpa Jim.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: A one-off example is a Sunday strip from a couple of years ago about the Pattersons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">"going green"</a>, while the rest of the world continues to waste and rot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>: The strip's site has no forum, but some of the regular contributors to the letters page can veer close to this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage">Yiddish as a Second Language</a>: Mrs. Saltzman peppered her speech with increasingly more Yiddishisms as time went on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>:<ul><li> Anthony when he had his mustache.</li><li> Gordon and Weed in the later years, especially in comparison to Michael.
