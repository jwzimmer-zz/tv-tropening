Born in 1972, it was something of a continuation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchShow">Sketch Show</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ImSorryIllReadThatAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ImSorryIllReadThatAgain">I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again</a></em> (which was also the origin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies">The Goodies</a></em>). The main difference was that, as a panel game, they didn't need to write any scripts.</p><p>The chairman was Humphrey Lyttelton, a jazz trumpeter (the thinking being that improvisational comedy owed a lot to jazz), who created the persona of a curmudgeonly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> who would rather be doing something else. <em>Anything</em> else <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27w07');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note27w07" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27w07');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">except playing the trumpet</span>. The regular teams for most of the show's history were Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden versus Tim Brooke-Taylor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillieRushton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillieRushton">Willie Rushton</a> (the third Goodie, Bill Oddie, was in the first two series).

Guests have also deputised for Barry, Tim or Graeme if they were unable to make a recording; in recent years Barry and Graeme have both cut down on their number of appearances and only appear once per series. Because of the show's pedigree, and the fact that the regulars have the final say in who the guests are, being asked to appear on the show has a certain amount of prestige attached to it (and many have turned down the opportunity for fear they might ruin it).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Other people on the show include Colin Sell, the long-suffering pianist, and Samantha, the entirely fictional scorer, about whom many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendres</a> are made. On one occasion, Colin Sell's stand-in as duty pianist was veteran jokester musician Neil Innes, best known for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand">The Bonzo Dog Band</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRutles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRutles">The Rutles</a></em>.

In one 1997 episode, Humph commented, "It's just occurred to me Samantha hasn't given us the score. Since 1981." It would be impossible to determine who won most of the games anyway, given that many of them don't make any sense, and the "Complete Quotes" round has the warning "points will be deducted for a correct answer".</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Most of the games are simply excuses for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">Hurricane of Puns</a>, but some have a surreality bordering on nonsensical. These include "Celebrity <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsMyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsMyLine">What's My Line?</a></em>" (in which the panel has to guess what a celebrity does for a living), versions of board games and other quizzes (where the joke is that we need to see what's going on to understand it), and, of course the Great Game, Mornington Crescent (a game of complex and subtle rules which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">to the uninitiated</a>, sounds like people shouting out tube stations at random) and its boardgame cousin Boardo! (complete with rattling dice and clicking counters).</p><p>There are also some musical rounds in the show. While the most popular musical game in the early years was the "Blues" (where each team has to create one on the spot), the three most popular throughout most of the show's run are "One Song to the Tune of Another" (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">self-explanatory</a>, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Humph thinks</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpospeakGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpospeakGag">otherwise</a>), "Pick-Up Song" (where each of the team members have to sing along to a song which is muted half way through and still be in time with the lyrics when the sound is turned back up) and "Swanee-Kazoo" (where each team has to play a given song with a swanee whistle and a kazoo). There was usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> at the expense of the late Jeremy Hardy whenever he was on the show as he was a hilariously terrible singer (which eventually extended to jokes about said singing even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">when he wasn't present</a>). Some of his singing from the show (specifically "Hallelujah" in the style of George Formby) was even used as a <em>Greatest Hits</em> moment on the announcement of his death.</p><p>The show has won three Golden Sony Awards, including one for <em>I'm Sorry I Haven't A Christmas Carol</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> which cast all the regulars and guest panelists into a version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> and somehow managed to force most of the games into the storyline. This was followed a couple of years later with <em>Humph <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">In Wonderland</a></em>. The show also spawned a sell-out live tour featuring classic rounds from previous series, initially with Jeremy Hardy as the guest; the most recent tour, in 2020, featured Tony Hawks and Miles Jupp in place of Barry and Graeme with several guest panellists.</p><p>The future of the show was in doubt following Lyttelton's death in 2008, although Series 51 was aired in mid-2009 with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>, Jack Dee, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobBrydon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobBrydon">Rob Brydon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestHost">taking over the chair for two episodes</a> each. Although he was not definitively stated to be the full-time replacement, the show returned to its regular schedule with Dee chairing every episode later that year; he has chaired every series since. In the 2015 tour of the live show, Sandi Toksvig took the chair for some dates.</p><p>The show's future is again unclear after Tim Brooke-Taylor, the last of the original panellists still regularly appearing on the show (Barry and Graeme now appear only occasionally), passed away from COVID-19 in April 2020. It was eventually announced that the show's 73rd series in Autumn 2020 would consist of Tim's final two episodes (recorded shortly before the nationwide lockdown), followed by four remotely recorded episodes with the surviving regulars and a virtual audience, but what the show will look like in the longer term is still unclear.</p><p>In 2012, the show's official site was launched, which can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.isihac.net/">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rounds&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p></p><h2>Ad-Lib Poem</h2>The chairman gives one line setting up a rhyme to a panellist. The panellist then continues the story in rhyming verse, until the chairman buzzes, at which point the poem passes to the next panellist, who does the same until an "artistic conclusion" is reached. Tim notoriously <em>hated</em> this round...which, of course, often led to him starting it off. Not played nowadays.<p></p><h2>The Bad-Tempered Clavier</h2>The teams attempt to sing a song while Colin Sell accompanies them. Colin eventually begins changing the tempo, playing wrong notes, and playing different songs altogether. The chairman often mentions that points are deducted for players attempting to sing with their hands over their ears. Not played nowadays.<p></p><h2>Blues</h2>One team gives a subject for a blues to the other team. The other team then improvise a blues, with each panellist taking alternate lines. They inevitably start with "I woke up this mornin'". (Occasionally, Humph would specifically mention penalizing a team for starting a blues with that sentence, which inevitably resulted in "I rose from my bed as dawn began" or some other synonym.) Variations included 'Calypso' (always starting with "I [thing related to the topic] the other day") and 'Madrigal'. Used to be one of the most reccurring rounds, but is now rarely played.<p></p><h2>Call My Bluff</h2>The chairman gives the teams a word to define. The panellists then define the word, each giving different punning definitions. The chairman picks the one he thinks is true, we hear the sound of paper unfolding as the answers are revealed, and the game ends. Not played nowadays.<p></p><h2>Censored Song</h2>The teams take a clean song and make it absolutely filthy by strategic censoring. (Usually one team member will sing the song whilst the other uses the buzzer, although occasionally the original song will be played.) Still pops up occasionally, but definitely not as common as it used to be. A similar idea had been used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ImSorryIllReadThatAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ImSorryIllReadThatAgain">I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again</a></em>.<p></p><h2>Closed Quotes</h2>Also known as <em>Quote Misquote</em> and <em>Complete Quotes</em>. The chairman reads the beginning of a quote, and one of the panellist finishes it in a humorous fashion. Quotes are generally taken from all manner of things &mdash; songs, poems, interviews, classics, opening lines, and so forth. Still frequently played.<p></p><h2>Cheddar Gorge</h2>The teams construct a sentence, taking one word each, with the goal being not to complete the sentence. If the chairman judges that a full stop has been reached, he'll honk his horn (ever since Jack took over, this has been replaced by a gong). Occasionally, each panellist gets a word that they'll have to "seamlessly integrate" into the story. Common ploys involve forming the phrase "and yet strangely" to force a player to describe something multiple times, or someone &mdash; frequently Tim &mdash; saying "comma" to buy time. On at least one occasion, Humph made it even harder by adding an extra rule, that all the words had to start with the same letter.<p>Nowadays, this is rarely played, being replaced with Letter Writing (or 84 Chicken Cross Road), which plays along the same principles with two major additions. One &mdash; instead of assembling a sentence, the teams are "writing letters" between one famous personality to another. The other team then composes a reply. Two &mdash; as you may have figured out, this is played in teams of two rather than both the teams saying words. This simplifies stalling, and someone &mdash; frequently Graeme &mdash; will often say "and" to force their teammate to come up with as many adjectives as they can. This version is still played frequently.</p><p></p><h2>DIY Drama</h2>The teams are given characters and sound effects, and then improvise a play from a given genre. Sometimes, the players are given free rein &mdash; other times, the chairman indicates scene changes or mentions which sound effects will have to be included beforehand. Very likely to go off the rails, and sound effects given to the panellists are pretty much guaranteed to pop up after the game's finished. One of the newer rounds, and played about once a series.<p></p><h2>Double Feature</h2>The panellists combine the names of films to make puns. Really, that's it. Puns can be literal (such as <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalfASixpence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalfASixpence">Half A Sixpence</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDirtyDozen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDirtyDozen">The Dirty Dozen</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em> being combined to make <em>Half A Dozen Eggs</em>). The meaning of the title can be used rather than the words. (Such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlloAllo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlloAllo">'Allo 'Allo!</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Boom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Boom">Boom</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FarewellMyLovely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FarewellMyLovely">Farewell, My Lovely</a></em> combining to make <em>A Short, Meaningless Relationship</em>. Or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LordOfTheFlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LordOfTheFlies">Lord of the Flies</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlashGordon1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlashGordon1980">Flash Gordon</a></em> combining to make <em>Would You Mind Accompanying Me To The Station</em>?) Then there are the truly <em>magnificient</em> puns, such as Barry combining <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KellysHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KellysHeroes">Kelly's Heroes</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrenchConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrenchConnection">The French Connection</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlCapone">Al Capone</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticVoyage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticVoyage">Fantastic Voyage</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XTheManWithTheXRayEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XTheManWithTheXRayEyes">X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessAndThePea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessAndThePea">The Princess and the Pea</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightmareAlley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightmareAlley">Nightmare Alley</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDuchessAndTheDustman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDuchessAndTheDustman">The Duchess And The Dustman</a></em> to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Superkellyfrenchaltasticexpeaalleyduchess</a></em>. Used to be very popular, but the last time it popped up was in 1995.<p></p><h2>Film Club</h2>The chairman gives a profession for a film club, book club, or song book, and the panellists make puns based on the profession, changing around the titles of films/books/songs in order to fit this particular profession. (Such as the bakers' film club &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur">Bun Hur</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Cake</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastTemptationOfChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastTemptationOfChrist">The Last Temptation Of Crust</a>.) Graeme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">invariably</a> makes a pun on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringMeTheHeadOfAlfredoGarcia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringMeTheHeadOfAlfredoGarcia">Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</a></em>. Still played often, usually as the closing game of the show.<p></p><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNewsBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNewsBadNews">Good News, Bad News</a></h2>One panellist says some good news, the other some bad news related to the good news, and so on. ("Good news: I've got a new jacuzzi." "Bad news: It wasn't a jacuzzi when I got in..." "Good news: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> was in it with me." "Bad news: But not for long.") Used to be quite popular, but has not been played since 1993.<p></p><h2>Historical Headlines</h2>The chairman says a famous historical event, and invites the players to come up with headlines. This round typically plays on the different viewpoints of different newspapers &mdash; running gags include <em>the Sport</em>, with its focus on supernatural events and sightings of Elvis, <em>the Daily Mail</em>, with its obsession with house prices, <em>the Evening Standard</em>, with its concentration on London-centric news, and the <em>Independent</em> with its no-nonsense, fact-stating reports. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Inevitably</a>, Graeme will do a "<em>The Guardian</em> corrections and clarifications" joke, which poke fun at the <em>Guardian</em>'s reputation for bad spelling by replacing a misspelled headline with an equally misspelled headline. (E.g. "Yesterday's headline 'bishops tickle Darwin's monkey theory' should have read 'bishops <em>tackle</em> Darwin's donkey, Terry'.") The last time it showed up was in 2007.<p></p><h2>Just A Minim</h2>The chairman gives one of the panellists a song which they must sing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JustAMinute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JustAMinute">without hesitation, repetition or deviation</a>. (The songs are always picked to make this as ridiculously difficult as possible, such as <em>Old Macdonald Had A Farm</em> or <em>It's Not Unusual</em>.) Other panellists may challenge at any time if they detect hesitation, repetition or deviation, and if the chairman judges that their challenge is correct, they take over from the point where the previous singer left off. Takes its inspiration, rather obviously, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JustAMinute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JustAMinute">Just a Minute</a></em> &mdash; Jack has taken to chairing the game using a caricature of Nicholas Parsons' energetic, enthusiastic speaking style. Played occasionally for a long time, often as a substitute to Swanee-Kazoo, but it appears to have been quietly retired as it has not appeared since 2016.<p></p><h2>Karaoke-Cokey</h2>The entire audience get a song displayed on the laser display board, and have to hum it. The panellists attempt to guess what it is. In the live tours, each member of the audience gets their own kazoo for this round. Rarely played, but still pops up occasionally.<p></p><h2>Last Episodes</h2>The chairman gives the name of a TV series (or film, or book) to one of the panellists, and asks them to "finish it off as quickly as you can". The panellists typically do this with implications of violence, swearing, sex, puns, or other unbroadcastable material. (Such as <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_My_Bluff_(UK_game_show)">Call My Bluff<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>: "And your word is...<em>(ting)</em> ...oh my god!") Not played nowadays.<p></p><h2>Late Arrivals</h2>One of the most long-running games. The chairman announces a ball for a certain profession, and the panellists come up with names that are puns on this profession. (Frequently taking the format of "Will you welcome, please, Mr. and Mrs. X, and their son/daughter, Y...") The Mad Scientists' Ball, for example, would have "Mr. and Mrs. Tube, and their daughter, Tess Tube" and "Mr. and Mrs. Tomicbomb, and their daughter, Anna". Graeme, if stuck for ideas, will make a "Gordon Bennett" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4upj9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4upj9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4upj9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Gordon Bennett" is an exclamation of surprise</span> -based joke, such as "Mr. and Mrs. Bennettnotanotherflamingpartypoliticalbroadcast, and their son, Gordon". Was played in the first ever episode, and is still played occasionally as the closing game of the show, as a substitute for <em>Film Club</em>.<p></p><h2>Limericks</h2>The chairman supplies the first line of a limerick, and the four panellists improvise a line each to complete it. The order of who said what line was always moved, and there would always be four limericks, so that all panellists got the ending line once. Panellists would usually be applauded for avoiding obvious obscenities. Not played nowadays.<p></p><h2>Missed Hits</h2>Also known as <em>Wuthering Hillocks</em>. The panellists name movies, songs, books and so on that didn't quite work, always puns on some existing work. (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesOfTheUnexpected" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesOfTheUnexpected">Tales of the Expected</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathInVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathInVenice">Deaf In Venice</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShakespeareInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShakespeareInLove">Shakespeare In Hove</a></em>, et cetera.) Last popped up in 2005.<p></p><h2>Mornington Crescent</h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">The Great Game. Any attempt to explain the rules would be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">redundant and patronizing</a>, but it is worth mentioning that the teams frequently play with special rules or regional variations (such as scrundling being disallowed, or a penalty introduced for leapfrogging). This has led some expert players to dismiss them as amateurs for not playing by the original rules &mdash; the teams have responded to this by saying that they find the intricacies of the variations to be of greater priority than a puritan attitude. Nevertheless, they have complied occasionally by playing the original game. As such a tradition could never die, it is still played nowadays.<p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">...Well, alright, it's an absolute load of wahooney consisting of the teams naming random stations on the London Underground and arguing vividly about made-up rules. That doesn't stop the fans from playing it themselves, though.</span></p><p>Nowadays always proceeded by the chairman reading out a letter from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Mrs Trellis of North Wales</a> which will be bizarre, incoherent, and addressed to the presenter of a different program.</p><p></p><h2>Name That Barcode</h2>The chairman reads a barcode aloud (such as "thick white, thick black, thin white, thin white, thin black, thick white") and the panellists give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableJokeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableJokeGame">suggestions as to what product it was for</a>. Only played once.<p></p><h2>Name That Motorway</h2>The panellists hear the sound of a motorway, and guess which one it is. Other variations include Name That Novellist (where the panellists hear a few seconds of somebody typing on a typewriter), Name Those Roadworks, Name That Pause and the most extreme of all &mdash; Name That Silence.<p></p><h2>Notes And Queries</h2>The chairman asks a question to one of the panellists. They suggest a possible answer, the chairman gives the real answer, and so on. Usually, after everyone's had a go, the rest of the questions are free-for-all, where anyone may give their answer. Sometimes played under the name <em>Household Hints</em> or <em>What's the Problem?</em> (which was an inverted version where the chairman gave the answer and the panellists had to offer possible questions).<p></p><h2>One Song To The Tune Of Another</h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">This can be a bit complicated,</a> so listen carefully...a song is like a cat. The music is the cat itself, and the lyrics are the cat's food, nourishing the cat and making it stronger. The cat, or music, will eventually get hungry again, and be filled with new food, or words. And there you have it &mdash; One Song To The Tune Of Another. But I know what you're thinking &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphorGotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphorGotten">what about lovesick cats?</a> We've all heard alley cats crooning an object of their affection, and what noise could possibly be worse than some lovesick mongrel yowling behind the dustbins? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">...</a> At the piano, Colin Sell!<p>Or, in other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">one song is sung to the tune of another.</a> It was the first game ever played on Clue, and is still played every other episode.</p><p></p><h2>Opera Time</h2>Panellists take a bland piece of prose (recipes, scripts, extracts from scouting manuals) and turn it into an operatic duet. Played well into the eighties, but not around anymore.<p></p><h2>...or Bedroom</h2>Panellists come up with phrases that can be said in a given location (such as in the car, in the kitchen, or at a funeral), or in the bedroom. Essentially just an excuse to throw out endless <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendres">Double Entendres</a>. A fairly modern game, and an occasional show-closer nowadays.<p></p><h2>Paranoia</h2>One team suffers from a delusion or complaint, but don't know what it is. The delusion is broadcast to the audience and the other team via the laser display board, and the team with the delusion have to ask the other team questions. The other team has to respond in a manner appropriate to the first team's delusion, until the first team manage to guess what it is. This has a variation in the <em>Doctors</em> game (latterly known as <em>The Symptoms</em>), which is basically vice versa &mdash; the team with the problem know what their problem is, and the other team pose as doctors trying to diagnose them. The team with the problem answer in a manner appropriate to their problem. This version is now the dominant one, with the original game all but retired.<p>One episode featured another variation, <em>Scandals</em>, where one team played the part of two people invited onto a chat show to discuss a recent scandal they were involved in. The other team, playing the part of the hosts, were aware of the scandal, and the first team had to guess what scandal they'd been implicated in.</p><p></p><h2>Pick-Up Song</h2>Samantha spins some discs on the chairman's gramophone, which a chosen panellist should sing along to. The music then drops out, but the singer continues singing, and if, when the music returns, he's within a midge's semi-quaver<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0k8o2');"><sup> *&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0k8o2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0k8o2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Nowadays a "gnat's crotchet"</span> of the original, he'll be awarded points (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePointsMeanNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePointsMeanNothing">allegedly</a>). And points mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLibsCatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLibsCatchPhrase">a concerning sheep-like mentality showing the low intellectual capacity of those involved in it</a>, what do points mean?<p><em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation">PRI</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowderKegCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowderKegCrowd">ZES!</a></strong></em></p><p>...Yes. The prizes are always some pun, such as the one for "the pet-lover who doesn't want their exotic pet to get lost &mdash; this stamped, addressed antelope". Or just silly. ("This week's prize is for the animal lover who wants to keep warm in bed. It's this hot water buffalo.") Still played nearly every other episode.</p><p></p><h2>Smugglers</h2>Panelists try to fit the names of things - such as animals or brand names - into sentences, with the other team buzzing in if they can spot one that's been hidden. For humour's sake, a similar convention to "Word for Word" is often applied, where an obvious hidden name is ignored in place of an obscure one. Only rarely played nowadays.<p></p><h2>Sound Charades</h2>The laser display board shows the title of a work for the audience and one team. The team then performs a small, improvised sketch, typically using a contrived pun or other wordplay for the other team to guess. Nowadays, Barry and Graeme make all their sketches about two eccentric Scotsmen, Hamish and Dougal, setting up jokes and puns for each other seamlessly. One of the mainstays of the show, and still played every other episode.<p></p><h2>Stars In Their Ears</h2>Also known as <em>The Singer And The Song</em>. Panellists sing songs in the style of a famous personality, drawing on accent imitation and impersonations for the humor. Still played occasionally.<p></p><h2>Straight Face</h2>The panellists say one word each, with the goal being not to provoke laughter from the audience. (The chairman often mentions how they've been training a lot for this.) If anyone elicits even the slightest titter from the audience, they're eliminated, and the game goes on until only one remains. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords">Inherently Funny Words</a> make this round harder than it sounds. (A variation had the panellists saying punchlines to jokes instead of just words.) Still occasionally played.<p></p><h2>Suitcases</h2>One team lists things beginning with a letter randomly chosen by the chairman, with the pretense of packing these things in a suitcase. The other team may challenge if they believe the object wouldn't fit in a suitcase or wouldn't be suitable on holiday. If the chairman upholds the challenge, they take over listing things with a randomly selected letter of their own. Not played nowadays.<p></p><h2>Swanee-Kazoo</h2>The teams play a song using a swanee whistle and a kazoo. (Tim and Graeme always play the swanee whistles, whereas Barry and Tim's guest always play the kazoos &mdash; although when Sandi Toksvig stood in for Graeme, Barry had a one-off go at the swanee whistle.) The humor comes from the naturally silly sound of these two instruments (usually described by the chairman as "the cheeky rasp of the kazoo and the smooth ululation of the swanee whistle"). Still played about every second episode.<p></p><h2>Uxbridge English Dictionary</h2>Formerly known as <em>New Definitions</em>, and renamed after a book containing the best definitions. The panellists say a word, then give a definition of the word, usually by breaking it down into smaller words or making a pun on an already-existing word. (Such as "Impolite: <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5xc10');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5xc10" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5xc10');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Imp alight</span> To set fire to a pixie.") Barry will occasionally say a word and define it as how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a> would pronounce something. ("Pastiche: <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note68zmo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note68zmo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note68zmo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">pasties</span> What Shean Connery eatsh in Cornwall.") Finest ever example was by Stephen Fry, who defined "Countryside" as "to kill Piers Morgan". Basically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">Hurricane of Puns</a> at its maximum. Still played every other episode.<p></p><h2>Word for Word</h2>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordAssociationTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordAssociationTest">word disassociation game</a>. One team exchange a random series of words with no connection whatsoever. The other team may challenge if they spot a connection, and if the chairman agrees with the challenge, they take over. Words with a <em>direct</em> connection are usually ignored in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">words with a roundabout, absurd connection</a>. ("Kangaroo." "Hop." "<em>(buzz)</em> A kangaroo might go to a dance...which, in America, is known as a hop.") Barry has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">made a habit</a> out of buzzing in on any two words and claiming they were a sixties rock band. First played in the second ever episode, and continues to appear regularly to this day.</div><p></p><hr><h2>Tropes:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-M&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentUponTheWrongSyllable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentUponTheWrongSyllable">AcCENT upon the Wrong SylLABle</a>: Humph would usually do this rather subtly, placing &mdash; or <em>neglecting</em> to place &mdash; emphasis on a word to completely change the meaning of the sentence.<div class="indent"><strong>Humph:</strong> The chairman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JustAMinute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JustAMinute">Just a Minute</a></em> is, of course, the irrepressible Nicholas Parsons.

If you think of a song as being a tin of music, filled with lyrics, it involves removing the lid from one song and scooping out the lyrics, discarding the tune (which isn't necessary for the game and can be recycled according to your local authority's refuse disposal guidelines), and emptying out the tune of another song (discarding the lyrics, in this case, which can either be saved in a covered dish in the refrigerator, or thrown away). You should now have one set of lyrics, and one tune. The clever bit is that you now combine the two, singing the words of the first song to the tune of the second &mdash; analogous to putting the contents of the first tin into the second. As should be clear by this point, all this is a complete aversion of the trope, as what is inside the tin is <em>not at all</em> what it says on the tin, but what it says on the tin in the bin.<ul><li> And speaking of bins, here's Colin Sell on the piano.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">Felony Misdemeanor</a>: In one episode, a variant on the "Mystery Illness" game was played called "Scandals".
