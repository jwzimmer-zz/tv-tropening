Hamilton acknowledges the anecdote with a smile.</li><li> Jefferson can't help but clap during the First Cabinet debate when Hamilton does a dance about Jefferson doing "whatever it is you do at Monticello". Then again, as he and a smug Madison put it, Hamilton's arguments for a bank is futile since he doesn't "have the votes".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: Given the sheer number of people and events involved in the American Revolution and subsequent early government, numerous people and events are left out of the play or only mentioned briefly:<ul><li> Members of the Hamilton and Schuyler families who go unmentioned:<ul><li> Hamilton's brother James Jr.; this is justified since the brothers were separated following their mother's death and cousin's suicide. James never came to the States and thus wasn't a huge part of Alex's life.</li><li> The Hamiltons' other children are only referenced in the play. He and Eliza historically had eight, but only Philip actually appears. Philip mentions having a little sister<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0myzu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0myzu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0myzu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Who was named Angelica in real life</span> in "Take a Break". He says he wants a little brother in the same line, but by the time the real-life Philip was nine he already had two, Alexander Jr. and James. However, there are references to the Hamiltons having other kids who are unseen, such as "We Know" where Burr mentions Hamilton's daughter and sons, which was accurate; his second daughter Elizabeth wasn't born until after the Reynolds Pamphlet was released; and "It's Quiet Uptown" where Hamilton talks about taking the children to church on Sunday.</li><li> Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy were not Philip and Catherine Schuylers' only children, just the three oldest. There were actually 15 kids in total, though seven died in infancy. The three surviving sons would have been children in the beginning of the play, and the youngest daughter would still have been an infant. Lin-Manuel Miranda had forgotten about the brothers' existence when he wrote Angelica's line "My father has no sons," but even after he realized his mistake, he kept it to enforce the theme of Angelica being the dutiful eldest daughter.</li></ul></li><li> During the revolution:<ul><li> In "Wait For It", Burr mentions his grandfather and parents before saying that "everyone who loves me has died", never once mentioning his older sister Sally, who all but raised him when their parents died while he was two<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1sqig');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1sqig" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1sqig');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you're curious, she didn't die until 1794, meaning that she's still alive at the time of the song</span>. While the two weren't close after he joined the Continental Army, it's rather odd for her to go unmentioned.</li><li> Cato, the slave of Hercules Mulligan who helped him spy on the British, is never mentioned, likely because it would make Hercules Mulligan unsympathetic (as part of the protagonists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>, basically anyone who is a good guy is portrayed as an abolitionist, regardless of historical accuracy). In fairness, Mulligan (along with Hamilton) was a founding member of an anti-slavery group.</li><li> Though he never actually appeared in any draft of the play, Lin-Manuel Miranda has stated that the personage he most wishes he could have included was Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, a Prussian officer whose training of the Continental Army transformed them from volunteers into a genuine fighting force. Hamilton in particular owed von Steuben a great debt for training them to use bayonets, since Hamilton's moment of military glory at Yorktown was primarily a bayonet charge. Hamilton and von Steuben (who settled in New York after the war) remained friends until the Baron's death in 1794.</li></ul></li><li> Post-Revolution:<ul><li> Aaron Burr had two other children (during the time of the musical) in addition to Theodosia: Louisa Charlotte and John Pierre, both conceived from a long-term affair he had with his maid before his wife's death.</li><li> Speaking of, Burr's wife Theodosia actually died in 1794, an event which goes unacknowledged besides the line "I had only one thought before the slaughter; this man will not make an orphan of my daughter" from "The World was Wide Enough". The original drafts of the show included a reprise of "Dear Theodosia" which would've had Burr singing to his daughter about her mother's death had the number not been scrapped.</li><li> The earliest drafts of the show featured George Clinton, the Governor of New York and eventualy Vice President (after the events of the musical) and a rival of Hamilton and the Schuyler family, as a major character, with funk songs styled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeClinton">the musician</a> of the same name. Unfortunately, Miranda found it difficult to incorporate Clinton into the play without disrupting the narrative and his songs were cut.</li><li> In real life, it was future president James Monroe who led the investigation into the Reynolds affair against Hamilton, with Jefferson working on the matter behind the scenes. However, Monroe doesn't fit into the rest of the narrative, so the already-established James Madison joins Jefferson and Burr instead. As a side effect of this, the musical also skips over the almost-duel that occurred between Monroe and Hamilton - a duel that was only prevented due to the intervention of, of all people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Aaron Burr</a>.</li><li> The Whiskey Rebellion is given only a single, indirect reference by Jefferson during the first Cabinet Battle. The tax was suggested and implemented at Hamilton's suggestion as a means of paying off the consolidated national debt. Hamilton and Washington very quickly put the rebellion down using the military, though they managed to do so without battle completely breaking out. Supposedly the original version of "One Last Time" was actually called "One Last Ride" and would've been about this very issue, but the number was reworked.</li><li> Hamilton becoming Commanding General of the U.S. Army during the Quasi-War with France (which occurred in the Adams Administration) is completely omitted, along with his dreams of military glory in a planned invasion of French and Spanish colonies in the Americas.</li><li> Maria Reynolds had a daughter named Susan, who goes unmentioned in the musical. In real life, Susan's life was ruined by the Reynolds Pamphlet, with everyone assuming she was a bastard child from Maria's affair with Hamilton and treating her accordingly, meaning there was no way to include her without further tanking Hamilton's sympathy.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalConsent">Adaptational Consent</a>: In the musical, Maria Reynolds swears that she willingly entered into the affair with Hamilton without any knowledge of her husband's plans and that she genuinely cares for him (it's ultimately left ambiguous as to whether or not she's telling the truth). Modern historians tend to agree that James purposely prostituted his wife and that Maria had no say in the matter, to say nothing of the power that Alexander himself would have held over her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalDumbass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalDumbass">Adaptational Dumbass</a>: In "Hurricane", Hamilton decides to write the Reynolds Pamphlet out of paranoia that his enemies would reveal his secret, but in real life it was for a far more sensible reason. By the time the pamphlet was published, the speculation charges mentioned in "We Know" had made their way to journalists and were publicly released, with said journalists openly accusing Hamilton of financial crimes. Thus, Hamilton released the pamphlet hoping that by admitting to the affair but denying the financial crimes he would be considered trustworthy and the charges would be forgotten (it actually worked too, but his reputation never fully recovered). In short, the historical corruption charges were already public, so his release of the pamphlet made more sense, while the theatrical corruption charges see Hamilton try to get out ahead of them and come out looking worse off for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>:<ul><li> Alexander and his friends treat ending slavery as a big part of the revolution. Although Hamilton's friends were largely anti-slavery (Hamilton, Lafayette, and John Laurens were noted abolitionists while Hercules Mulligan actually owned slaves at the time only to later become a founding member of an anti-slavery organization), it wasn't true of the revolution at large. During "Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)" reference is made towards "black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom", and Jefferson's slave-holding later is used to vilify him. Hamilton was opposed to slavery and generally worked in favor of abolishing it, particularly post-war, but he <em>had</em> bought slaves in the past for others. The "Black and white soldiers" fought on both the American <em>and</em> British sides during the conflict, since both sides recruited African-American slaves under the promise freedom after the war. All told it was actually the British who proved more honest in terms of keeping their word on this promise, as many former slaves traveled to England with their freedom. The British Empire also ended slavery 30 years before the United States, and without a civil war. Slave ownership of several characters (Washington, Hercules Mulligan, the Schuylers) is entirely glossed over.</li><li> Alexander&#146;s warmongering during the Quasi-War, stemming largely from his dreams of military glory (which many contemporaries compared unfavorably to Napoleon Bonaparte), is omitted entirely.</li><li> In the end, Aaron Burr is depicted as being deeply troubled by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his killing Hamilton in their duel</span>, but in real life this is far more ambiguous. Some reports indicate he was unfazed about having taken Hamilton's life, others even go so far as to suggest he had intended to kill Hamilton in the duel all along. On the other hand, later in life he really was quoted with the "world is wide enough" line, but there is even more confusion over whether he was being serious or sarcastic.</li><li> In the musical, Jefferson and the others promise to keep Hamilton's affair secret, and although Hamilton himself goes public with it shortly after, they do keep their promise. In real life, the reason why Hamilton released the pamphlet in the first place was because Jefferson started spreading the rumor around to his colleagues, which when combined with the recent arrest of James Reynolds threw Hamilton into a corner he had to try to write his way out of.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>:<ul><li> No, Hamilton never punched the bursar for calling him stupid; Lin-Manuel Miranda simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">couldn't resist the rhyme with "Burr, sir."</a></li><li> The conflict between George Eacker and Philip Hamilton is modified so that Eacker is more of a clear villain. George Eacker didn't actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cheat and shoot Philip early in real life</span>; they both aimed at the ground without firing for a while, before both men raised their pistols and fired. Since Eacker fired first, it's unclear if Philip intended to fire or did so unintentionally.</li><li> It's worth noting that although the show features the idea of shooting into the air, (including, prominently, on the poster,) this was not a common way of "throwing away your shot", or "deloping". Usually, someone who intended not to fire would aim at the ground, as raising your pistol to fire in the air could <em>very</em> easily be misinterpreted as raising one's pistol to fire. Hamilton recorded before the duel that he had no intention of aiming to kill, but to Burr, Hamilton raising a pistol at all seemed to imply otherwise.</li><li> Thomas Jefferson is depicted as insulting Alexander Hamilton's immigrant background. In reality it was Jefferson who wanted to allow immigrants citizenship, a position which was opposed by <em>Hamilton</em>. It was John Adams, of all Hamilton's rivals, who most often attacked Hamilton's background (which is acknowledged in "The Adams Administration").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationRelationshipOverhaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationRelationshipOverhaul">Adaptation Relationship Overhaul</a>:<ul><li> Angelica's feelings for Hamilton are specifically romantic, and the cut song "Congratulations" calls her marriage loveless. In real life, while Angelica and Hamilton were very good friends (with some at the time even thinking they were lovers), there is no evidence that there were genuine romantic feelings on either side. Additionally, Angelica actually eloped with her husband out of fear for her father's reactions to her husband's British ties, meaning she did truly love him.</li><li> There is no physical evidence suggesting that Hercules Mulligan ever met John Laurens or the Marquis de Lafayette, much less became close friends with them as depicted in the musical. There certainly were times they could have crossed paths, considering all three were active in the revolution, but if they actually ever met there is no proof. Hamilton and the other two men did actually exchange many letters and became close friends during the revolution, however.</li><li> Madison and Jefferson were good friends in real life, but politically they were equals and treated each other as such - the musical turns Madison into Jefferson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>, especially once the election of 1800 comes around.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>:<ul><li> Washington's first verse in "Right Hand Man" uses alliteration as part of a shoutout to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em>.<div class="indent">Now I'm the <strong>m</strong>odel of a <strong>m</strong>odern <strong>m</strong>ajor general <br>The <strong>v</strong>enerated <strong>V</strong>irginian <strong>v</strong>eteran whose men are all <br>Lining up to <strong>p</strong>ut me on a <strong>p</strong>edestal <br>Writing letters to relatives <br><strong>E</strong>mbellishing my <strong>e</strong>legance and <strong>e</strong>loquence</div></li><li> During Hamilton's section of "Cabinet Battle #2":<div class="indent"><strong>M</strong>eddling in the <strong>m</strong>iddle of a <strong>m</strong>ilitary <strong>m</strong>ess</div></li><li> One of Hamilton's verses in "We Know":<div class="indent">I never <strong>s</strong>pent a <strong>c</strong>ent that wasn't mine <br>You <strong>s</strong>end the dogs after my <strong>sc</strong>ent - that's fine!</div></li><li> Burr's description of Lafayette in "Guns and Ships".<div class="indent">He's <strong>c</strong>onstantly <strong>c</strong>onfusing, <strong>c</strong>onfounding the British henchmen <br>Ev'ryone give it up for America's <strong>f</strong>avorite <strong>f</strong>ighting <strong>F</strong>renchman!</div></li><li> A brief but tongue-twisting example from Helpless: "We were at a <strong>r</strong>evel with some <strong>r</strong>ebels on a hot night."</li><li> Not just word-to-word, but syllable-to-syllable in Washington on Your Side: "If Washington isn't gon' listen to <strong>d</strong>iscipline<strong>d</strong> <strong>d</strong>issi<strong>d</strong>ents this is the <strong>d</strong>ifference: This kid is out!"</li><li> Also in the cut song "Congratulations".<div class="indent">I <strong>l</strong>anguished in a <strong>l</strong>oveless marriage in <strong>L</strong>ondon, I <strong>l</strong>ived only to read your <strong>l</strong>etters.</div></li><li> In "The World Was Wide Enough":<div class="indent">This man has <strong>p</strong>oisoned my <strong>p</strong>olitical <strong>p</strong>ursuits!</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild">Adorably Precocious Child</a>:<ul><li> Peggy Schuyler in "The Schuyler Sisters" who manages to bring up that the upcoming war isn't going to be a bed of roses; that strife will come to American shores and their father may end up in danger by wanting to join the fight.

This didn't <em>exactly</em> happen in real life; however, the reverse actually did, in which Hamilton joked that a misplaced comma in a letter by Angelica hinted that <em>she</em> was attracted to <em>him</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding">Ambiguous Ending</a>: In the filmed version of "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story", Eliza comes out to deliver her closing lines, the song draws to a close... and out of nowhere Eliza gives a sudden gasp. There have been multiple speculations on what this gasp means, including that it symbolizes Eliza's final breath (and with it, the end of the last person involved with the play's events) or that Eliza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">sees through the audience</a> and realizes that their story lives on.<ul><li> Lin himself has said, when asked what Eliza's gasp means, that he doesn't know, that it's unique to each actress, and they're not talking either.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>: Deconstructed, as the play depicts ambition in and of itself as neither good nor bad. While Hamilton is extremely ambitious, he devotes himself first to America's independence, then towards developing a stable, lasting form of government and finance to help the new country. Burr's ambition is played less positively, as he seems less interested in achieving anything tangible through his ambitions, beyond his own advancement and creating a personal legacy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory">Another Side, Another Story</a>: "Helpless" is a sweet love song about how Eliza feels about meeting Alexander and how he proposes to her. "Satisfied," which is right after it, shows the conversation from Angelica's point of view and it suddenly becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">tragic song of self sacrifice</a>.<ul><li> Taken out of the final version, but the original "Ten Things You Need to Know" number featured Burr's malicious interpretations of Hamilton's actions on the dueling ground, followed by Hamilton recounting the innocent reasoning behind exactly the same actions. Still somewhat present in the final version, where Burr's perspectives remain and Hamilton's narration of the events is replaced with a monologue which does establish he means well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>:<ul><li> 10. "Ten dollar Founding Father," "Ten Duel Commandments", et cetera.

"Satisfied" and satisfaction in general are recurrent &mdash; duels are resolved when one party is satisfied, etc., but the word is used to refer first to Alexander and Angelica's shared restlessness. Later, Angelica sings "God, I hope you're satisfied!" to call him out on publishing the Reynolds Pamphlet.</li><li> "Would that be enough?" for (usually fruitless) attempts to quell obsession.</li><li> "Talk less, smile more," Burr's advice to Hamilton.</li><li> "If you stand for nothing, Burr, what do you fall for?" Hamilton's response to Burr's advice.</li><li> "Look around, look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now" is repeated several times. At first, the first part of it is sung by Angelica, talking about how revolution is happening and they're lucky to be in New York to see it happen. Later it is sung by Eliza, regarding how they are at war and she and Hamilton are lucky to not be dead, and later it is sung by Hamilton, echoing the first meaning about how lucky they(he) are(is) to be involved in the birth of a new nation, and then it crops back up again in <em>It's Quiet Uptown</em> when Hamilton and Eliza are reconciling.</li><li> "Helpless," Eliza's adoration for Hamilton, but it later means her helplessness to keep her with him, Maria's helplessness against her husband, and Alexander's own helplessness to stop his affair.</li><li> "How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore..." Words that signify closure of one segment of a show and progression to another.</li><li> "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9..."

Hamilton's "just you wait" mantra contrasting with Burr's "wait for it." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And at the end when they switch philosophies for the duel it ends tragically. Burr's final "WAIT" comes too late.</span></li><li> "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story," repeated throughout the show, is the central theme of the play.</li><li> A more minor example, but King George's "Oceans rise, empires fall", which is repeated at the same point and in the same tone in all three of his songs. This is apparently meant to represent the hardships of leadership.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>:<ul><li> In "Aaron Burr, Sir", Hamilton asks "if you stand for nothing, Burr, what will you fall for?".

Justified insofar as the concept of reasonable doubt was fairly new at the time. Indeed, as Hamilton notes, it was the first murder trial in the history of the nation.

The Schuyler family was a slaveowning family and Hamilton negotiated, on occasion, the sale and acquisition of slaves and runaways for the family. In addition, for all that the play emphasizes Hamilton's immigrant success story, in real-life he made it harder for immigrants to find property and voting rights. His support for the Alien and Sedition Acts is ignored, while his feud with John Adams (which largely destroyed the Federalist Party) is only mentioned in passing. As Sean Willentz notes, Hamilton was a man of the "1%" and not a populist hero.</li><li> The more negative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">Questionable Consent</a> connotations of Hamilton's affair with Maria Reynolds aren't really addressed either. He was an incredibly powerful figure as Treasury Secretary at that point and she was a desperate young mother eleven years his junior in a time in which there was no social safety net and when women were still viewed as property. He also knowingly ruined her life several years later when he published the Reynold Papers without any thought about how it would affect her.</li><li> Washington is portrayed the most sympathetically, even though like Jefferson he owns slaves and was classist in his early years as general. Nevertheless, in all of his songs he comes off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> who treats Hamilton with firm kindness and thinks of the country's good. Washington is generally regarded more lightly regarding slavery, because he released his slaves upon his death, which few of the other Founding Fathers did.</li><li> Hercules Mulligan <em>was</em> a spy, but so was his slave Cato, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> of the musical since it would be awkward to have John Laurens sing about abolition when one of his drinking buddies happens to own a slave. Also ironic is that the spy who was actually responsible for giving Washington the information necessary to win at Yorktown and thus end the war was not Mulligan but another slave named James Armistead. Doubly ironic is that Armistead later added "Lafayette" to his name because of the Frenchman's tireless efforts to secure his freedom after the war, while in the play Lafayette's abolitionism remains implied at best.</li><li> Possibly Angelica; some historians suggest that she didn't just fantasize about being with Hamilton and joke about sharing him with Eliza, but that the two actually had an affair. In the play, she has feelings for him but won't even consider betraying her sister. The play also suggests that she sacrificed herself in a "loveless" marriage, but in actuality, she and her husband eloped because her father didn't approve of him&mdash;she didn't marry from a sense of duty. As with the rest of the Schuylers, her family's slaveowning is glossed over.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Burr in the play expects</a> that, because he killed Hamilton, history's view of his life will be unfairly negative:<div class="indent"><strong>Burr:</strong> History obliterates.

Burr created institutions to provide loans for the poor, and he campaigned to expand voting rights to the poor, a point on which Hamilton loathed him for. As noted by Gore Vidal and several others, while Hamilton was an immigrant and Burr an aristocrat in background, the former defended property and elite rights, while the latter expanded rights for the common man. Likewise, Burr publicly expressed support for women's suffrage and also played a part in abolishing slavery in New York. The play stresses Hamilton's support for manumission of slaves, but does not mention Burr's more substantial involvement in anti-slavery organizations at the same time (he and Hamilton were both members of the New York Manumission Society in the 1780s during its efforts to emancipate slaves in New York).</li><li> Jefferson comes off the worst, due to being a major opponent of Hamilton's and having several songs that highlight his hypocrisy over the issue of slavery. While the latter isn't unjustified from a modern perspective, by downplaying Washington's slave-owning and Hamilton's own involvement (however peripheral) in the slave trade, it makes Jefferson seem almost uniquely hypocritical rather than typical of his time and place in his ambivalence towards slavery.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note125307');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note125307" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note125307');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actual <em>defenses</em> of slavery, at least by prominent Americans, didn't seriously begin until the 1830s, when Southern politicians like John Calhoun began arguing it was "a positive good" rather than a necessary evil for the Southern economy.</span> In real-life as a President he did abolish America's participation in the international slave trade in 1807, but that comes after the timeline of the show. Likewise, no mention is made of his support for the rights of the poor and for religious freedom, both positions Hamilton opposed.</li><li> The real King George III was considered to be a fairly benevolent monarch for his time, and most of the repressive policies blamed on him were the doing of George's ministers and Parliament; in the play, however, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> tyrant.

First is "The Reynolds Pamphlet" where Hamilton admits his affair with Maria Reynolds to clear his name of legal wrongdoing. The song humorously features Jefferson, Madison, Burr, and even King George dancing and gloating that Hamilton will never be president. Then it's followed by "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong">Burn</a>", which is Eliza's heartbroken, furious reaction to the whole thing. And she is <em>not</em> laughing. "Burn" is directly followed by Philip's upbeat character song "Blow Us All Away" about him finding his place in the world as a young adult, which is then followed by the devastating "Stay Alive (Reprise)" and the equally-somber "It's Quiet Uptown." And after <em>that</em> is "The Election of 1800", which opens with Jefferson asking if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">they can get back to politics now</a>.</li><li> King George's first song, <em>You'll Be Back</em>, is a delightfully hammy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainLoveSong">Villain Love Song</a> where he sings about his obsessive romance with America. Jonathon Groff plays it up by looking silly and walking silly and throwing in silly facial emotes. Then he announces that he's <em>not</em> letting America go, he's sending soldiers to make make sure he controls the country, and he tops it off by stating that he will remind America that he loves them by <em>killing everyone that opposes him</em>. It reeks of a horribly abusive relationship, and only gets worse when, at the end of the song, a soldier comes on stage and outright kills someone.</li><li> The only song not present in the official cast recording is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">Dark Reprise</a> of "The Story of Tonight," sung by John Laurens, as Hamilton learns in a letter that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his best friend is dead</span>. This happens immediately after "Dear Theodosia," a sweet and happy song about Hamilton's and Burr's firstborn children, and is directly followed by "Non-Stop," an energetic ensemble number.</li><li> A slightly strange example in "Your Obedient Servant" comes in the dramatic shift in tone between different parts of the song; the seemingly lighthearted teasing of the chorus (Burr and Hamilton singsonging their signatures, the latter's being shortened to "A. Ham" since his last name is too many syllables to fit the beat) is <em>immediately</em> followed by Burr's lines:<div class="indent"><strong>Burr:</strong> Careful how you proceed, good man <br>Intemperate indeed, good man <br>Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or <br>Prepare to bleed, good man.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>: Eliza is a moral touchstone for most of the cast except for James and Maria Reynolds. George Washington explicitly keeps Hamilton out of danger after learning Eliza is pregnant, Angelica introduces her sister to the young Alexander on realizing Eliza loves him, and Jefferson, Madison, and Burr express sympathy for her after the Reynolds Pamphlet comes out. Burr in the Workshop version explicitly tells Hamilton to treat her well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a>:<ul><li> Angelica has one of the fastest, most difficult patter in the show with "Satisfied"&mdash;Lin-Manuel Miranda admits that <em>he</em> can't wrap his mouth around it. <a class="urllink" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hamilton-is-the-very-model-of-a-modern-fast-paced-musical/">FiveThirtyEight.com<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> clocked it at 5 words per second.</li><li> Lafayette spits some of the fastest verses in the show (and one of the fastest <em>in Broadway history</em>) in the first part of "Guns and Ships."

He is to be paid in advance, in case of a double fatality. All interactions with him must be civil, because the duelists' lives are in his hands. Finally, his exposure to litigation as an acessory to the duel must be minimized by telling him to face away from the duel so he cannot be a witness to it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>: A few, as even a musical as long as this can't fit in everything. Notable examples include:<ul><li> Madison's falling out with Hamilton - in Act One, they're co-writing <em>The Federalist Papers</em>; in Act Two, Jefferson notes that Madison <em>hates</em> Hamilton.</li><li> The entire Presidency of John Adams is noted to be "intraction" and that is all we hear of it.</li><li> From a historical (and Aaron Burr's) point of view, whatever happened in <em>The Room Where It Happens</em> - something the song underlines with its repeated "Thomas claims". Jefferson's writings are the only source we have for this meeting, and most historians regard them as... less than impartial. This is lampshaded when the show has him presenting Madison as Hamilton's enemy and himself as the reasonable middleman willing to give Hamilton an ear, when every other part of the show makes it clear that he's the one who's leading the charge against Hamilton and <em>Madison</em> is following.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTalkingOrPhonesWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTalkingOrPhonesWarning">"No Talking or Phones" Warning</a>: As with every Broadway show, this type of announcement is made before every performance.

In real life Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson happened for different reasons, but in the musical, that jibe from Burr is directly related to Hamilton's endorsement, which happens immediately after in the song.</li><li> While the conversation is incorporated into "The Reynolds Pamphlet," the scrapped song "Congratulations" consists of Angelica calling Hamilton out on his "stupid" actions of publishing his affair.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: Discussed by Burr in "The Room Where It Happens" as from his perspective he witnessed Hamilton sell America's soul to Jefferson for financial power.<div class="indent"><strong>Chorus:</strong> We dream of a brand new start, <br><strong>Burr:</strong> But we dream in the dark for the most part.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

The antagonists sincerely believe they're doing the right thing. Even Aaron Burr, who ends up killing the title character, is portrayed as being a conflicted, complicated man, but ultimately a good one who genuinely regrets what he did.

When Charles Lee basically bails on the army during the Battle of Monmouth, Washington calls for Hamilton, who seems ready to finally take command of the troops, only for Washington to tell him to put Lafayette in charge. Hamilton is disappointed, but his later remarks and attitude by the time of Yorktown imply he at least had no problem with his whip-sharp friend taking command over him.</li><li> Jefferson is impressed with Hamilton's rapping during the first cabinet battle and even claps a little in a "alright, you got me there" way during their debate.
