She could feel that she had stopped moving. <br>Silly though it was, Asuka was afraid to open her eyes.

Asuka had clearly created it by crashing through the building, and yet she didn't have a scratch on her. <br>And as if that wasn't shocking enough by itself, she was now floating in midair just outside the hole she'd made in the decrepit tower. Asuka looked down at the street far below, naked disbelief written all over her features. Part of mind dimly worried about people looking up her dress, even though she knew she was far too high up for anyone to see anything. <br>All of a sudden, her shock collapsed, and she again broke out into a broad smile. Throwing one arm up above her head, the Second Child suddenly took off, rocketing up into the sky. <br>"This is even better than the running!" she exclaimed as she broke through the cloud layer. <br>Once above the clouds, she allowed herself to hover for a few moments, just looking down at the world far below her and soaking in the unobstructed light of the sun. Asuka could feel that the air was cold up at this high elevation, but it didn't bother her in the slightest. Everything was silent save for the sound of the wind, giving her an almost profound feeling, as though she were in a cathedral or some other sacred place. <br>After a few moments, Asuka began to soar through the clouds again, and she remained up in the sky for a long, long time.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture">Fling a Light into the Future</a>: Jor-El sends his son to Earth, but a minor miscalculation on his part results in Kal-El's ship crashing in Germany, killing him.
