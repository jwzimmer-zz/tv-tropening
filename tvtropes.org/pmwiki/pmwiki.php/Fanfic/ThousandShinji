The air began to swim with unholy sounds, almost as if the wind had a forked tongue and was chanting in some blasphemous language. Something unpleasant was going on beneath the armour of Unit 02, waterfalls of blood leaking forth from its wounds, turning the ground bellow and the nearby lake vermillion. <br>With a scream brought forth from the very universe itself, the back of Unit 02&#146;s armour exploded outward in a shower of broken metal and ceramics and a flood of brilliant crimson blood. A pair of colossal bat wings unfurled, flicking blood off their surface as they extended, before making a powerful downward stroke that launched Unit 02 into flight, seemingly ignoring the winds generated by the storm still raging above. <br>Reaching a hand out into nothingness, Asuka grabbed onto something with each hand and began to pull out. Twin ragged streaks appeared in the sky, blood raining from holes in reality as Unit 02 extracted its new weapons. In the right hand it held a titanic bronze battle axe dripping with blood on its adamantine blade, while in the left it bore a long, snaking whip covered in barbs.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder">One World Order</a>: After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the War and Third Impact, the four new Chaos Gods</span> rule the devastated planet.<div class="indent">Today there are no more nations, there is only humanity."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>: When Touji and Kensuke see usually stoic and emotionless Rei Ayanami smiling and acting giddy, they get scared and wonder what Shinji has done to her.<div class="indent">&#147;Toji&#133; are my glasses busted or is Rei running towards us?

Then would begin the slow, methodical removal of limbs, inch by inch, each new wound being cauterized to avoid death by blood loss. By the end they would be skinless heads attached to torsos, eyes gouged out, noses cut off, tongues yanked free of mouths, lips sewn shut with rusty ten gauge wire, and tubes inserted to keep them alive and in pain. I would then probably conquer the world, or at least a large chunk of it, so as to build a suitably grand tribute to the loss, probably a pyramid to embarrass the ones in Egypt, only made out of the bodies of my enemies coated in resin to prevent decay and give better structural stability. This of course would be occurring while I try everything to undo the damage," Shinji describes vividly. <br>Shivering in a mix of fear and pleasure, Asuka says, "Sweet talker."</em></div><hr>
