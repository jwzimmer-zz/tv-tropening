Robb "arrives" to several months before Jon Arryn's death, but the great change begins when Ned Stark learns not only of the events that might have taken place if the future was not changed, but of the incoming threat of the White Walkers. This leads to an avalanche of changes that sends every character in completely different (and some even unexpected) paths as the hidden history of the world becomes revealed and the worst winter in centuries approaches.</p><p>In spite of this, though, the Game of Thrones continues.
