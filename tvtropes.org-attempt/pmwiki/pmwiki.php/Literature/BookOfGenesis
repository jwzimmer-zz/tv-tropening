In the Jewish tradition, it is the first book of the Torah and known as <em>Bereshit</em> ("In the beginning"; books of the Torah are known in Hebrew by their first word in that language). Literally everything begins here.</p><p>Genesis starts with a narrative of God's creation of the universe, before focusing on the first two people and how they came to reject God's Paradise. The man who killed their son and their son, Cain, continued the corruption of the world and passed that evil on to his descendants until God had to wash over the whole thing and start anew. The only holdovers from the old creation are the righteous Noah, his family, and the animals they brought along. From them, all the peoples of the world came, including Abraham.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Called upon by God, Abraham agreed to serve Him faithfully so that his descendants would outnumber the stars. As part of the covenant, the infertile Sarah gave birth to the beloved Isaac. Isaac himself would have the sons Jacob and Esau, who would hate each other in youth and only after years of deception and fighting come to love each other. In this peace, Jacob had twelve sons, favoring Joseph most of all. Jealous, Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery, but by God's grace, Joseph rose to become the right-hand man of the Pharaoh. Rich and at peace, Joseph would invite his family in Israel to enjoy the bounties of Egypt, where Jacob and Joseph would die while the latter's sons would live without hating each other.</p><p>The book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">plays with</a> some of the aspects from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology">Mesopotamian Mythology</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">Creation Myths</a>, with the most unique feature being the singular, supreme, and intelligent nature of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. There are also many parallels with its "sequel," the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Book of Exodus</a>, as well as historical events, such as the life of Abraham. People are divided over just how literal the first several chapters even are, with the rest of the book being more or less confirmed by archaeology and the former usually being seen as metaphorical or a semi-literal telling of events.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><hr><h2> Structure of the book:</h2><ul><li> Creation of the world (Genesis 1:1-2:3)</li><li> Creation of Man (Genesis 2:4-25)</li><li> Fall of Man (Genesis chapter 3)</li><li> The first murder (Genesis chapter 4)</li><li> From Adam to Noah (Genesis chapter 5)</li><li> The story of Noah (Genesis chapters 6 to 9)</li><li> The children of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (Genesis chapter 10)</li><li> The Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-8)</li><li> From Shem to Abraham (Genesis 11:9-32)</li><li> The story of Abraham (Genesis chapters 12 to 18 and 20 to 25)</li><li> The story of Lot (Genesis chapters 11 to 14, and 18 to 19)</li><li> The stories of Isaac and Jacob (Genesis chapters 25 to 35)</li><li> The descendants of Esau (Genesis chapter 36)</li><li> The story of Joseph (Genesis chapters 37 and 39 to 50)</li><li> The story of Judah and Tamar (Genesis chapter 38)</li></ul><hr><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h2> Genesis contains the following tropes:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyElderlyMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyElderlyMother">Absurdly Elderly Mother</a>: Sarah, who was in her nineties and way past menopause, is told by God's visiting angels that she's going to have the promised child from her husband Abraham. Sarah laughs at this, thinking the whole thing to be impossible, but God gets the last laugh when He fulfills this promise and she bears her first and only son Isaac.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot">Adam and Eve Plot</a>: The Trope Namer. God's instructions to the first people are: "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it." Some Bible students who go by the King James Version's use of the word "replenish" instead of "fill" insist that the first humans God had created were to replace the ones that existed before them in the "gap period" between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2.<ul><li> Later on, when Noah and his family were the only human survivors on the earth after the Flood, God gives them the command to repopulate the earth and make it fruitful. Humanity from that point on is descended from them, as the text implies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent">Alcoholic Parent</a>: After the flood, Noah plants the first vineyard and gets so drunk he winds up passing out naked. His son Ham thinks this is hilarious and calls his brothers to come see. They respectfully cover him with a blanket instead, walking backwards so they won't have to see their dad naked. For his disrespect, Noah curses Ham's son Canaan to be a "servant of servants" of his relations. Why Canaan and not Ham himself? Nobody's quite sure, although it's pretty clear that the <em>real</em> point is justifying the Hebrews' enmity towards the Canaanites.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ps0l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ps0l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ps0l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unfortunately, Noah's curse&mdash;which isn't even a real curse, because it's a hung-over father cussing out his idiot son rather than God imposing punishment&mdash;came to be called the "Curse of Ham" and sometimes used to justify enslaving black people, because supposedly Ham was dark-skinned and the ancestor of black people &mdash; ignoring that the curse was specifically narrowed to Ham's only <strong>non</strong>-African son, his other three sons free of the curse.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>: In Chapter 34, after Shechem raped Dinah and then offered to pay her family as much dowry as they desired in order to have her as a wife, her brothers Simeon and Levi told him that they can't give Dinah to him unless he and the men of the city would become one people with the clan of Jacob by becoming circumcised. Of course, this was all a ruse in order to incapacitate the men of Shechem so that Jacob's clan could have revenge for Dinah being raped, but Shechem and his men were willing to go along with it, and so that sealed their fate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">And Man Grew Proud</a>: Then Man built a tower intended to reach Heaven. God decided to put a stop to it and confuse the language of man. Which is why language classes are needed in the present day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">Angel Unaware</a>: Lot didn't know that his two guests were angels until after taking them in for the night when the citizens of Sodom pound on the door, demanding Lot to bring them out so they can "know" them, and after trying and failing to protect his guests, the guests themselves reveal themselves as such by blinding Lot's assailants and getting Lot, his wife, and his two daughters out of the city before its destruction.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>: The Great Flood destroys all humanity and all land animals on the planet, except for what is saved on Noah's ark. Class 2 or 4, depending on whether any species were completely wiped out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>: When Joseph invites his brothers into his palace for a meal, while he's still unrecognizable to them, they're afraid he will attack them, seize them as slaves, and... take their donkeys?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>: In the section describing the lineage of Adam's son Seth, each patriarch's mini-biography ends with "... and he died." <em>Except for Enoch</em>, whose description instead ends with "Enoch walked with God, and he was no longer here, for God took him." It's ambiguous, but the writer of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfHebrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfHebrews">Book of Hebrews</a> interpreted it to mean that Enoch "was taken up so that he should not see death".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning">Awesome Moment of Crowning</a>: Joseph's ascension into Pharaoh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>, with the requisite regalia and parade. Pharaoh makes it clear that the only difference between them is that Pharaoh has the throne; otherwise, Joseph has full authority over the land of Egypt, and 'no one may lift hand or foot in all Egypt without (Joseph's)' word.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty Equals Goodness</a>: Played straight with the matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca and Rachel. Not specifically mentioned concerning the patriarchs, with the exception of Joseph, whose physical beauty is mentioned.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a>:<ul><li> Jacob's wedding. He had worked for Laban for seven years in order to get permission to marry Laban's daughter Rachel, but Laban swapped Rachel out for her older sister Leah on the night of the wedding. Jacob didn't notice this until they were already married, so although he got to marry Rachel the next week, he had to work another seven years to earn (retroactively) his marriage to Rachel, the girl he actually loved.</li><li> Tamar, a widow of Judah's sons, was due a marriage to another man of the family under the rules of levirate marriage. When it seemed Judah was not going to go through with this, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and met him on the road, taking his staff and sigil as payment. She conceived twins and, when Judah realized what had happened and she explained her reasons, he was shamed into admitting his mistakes and, while he didn't marry her, he did acknowledge the twins as his children and heirs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">Big Brother Bully</a>: Abraham's firstborn son Ishmael, who sometime after his half-brother Isaac's birth, was mocking him during his party. This made Isaac's Sarah so upset when she saw it that her husband sent Ishmael and his mother Hagar away from them permanently, thus they will not share in the inheritance that was meant for Isaac. Abraham became worried about this, but God told him to do as Sarah told him, for He will bless Ishmael and make him into a great nation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a>: Jacob's family, with all the rivalries, deceptions, and intrigue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodOath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodOath">Blood Oath</a>: God has Abraham sacrifice animals so that He could seal His covenant with Abraham to give the land of Canaan to him and his descendants forever. Later on, this blood oath would take the form of circumcision, which God commanded Abraham and his descendants to perform on all his male family members as well as any male they have purchased for themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult">Born as an Adult</a>: Adam and Eve, the first two of God's human creations ("gap period theology" notwithstanding), came into being as adults, with Adam formed from the dust of the ground, and Eve formed from Adam's rib. In fact, it is likely that all of God's living creatures came into existence as adult forms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFellowship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFellowship">Breaking the Fellowship</a>: Abraham and Lot journeyed together through the Promised Land, then to Egypt, then back to the Promised Land again. By Chapter 13, though, strife between Abraham's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen because the land was not big enough to sustain both men's families together required them to split up. Abraham allowed Lot to choose which direction he wanted to take, and Lot decided to head in the direction of Sodom, which is where he and his family ended up in. Abraham remained in the Promised Land, which God swore that He would give to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham and Lot do meet up together again when Lot and the inhabitants of Sodom were abducted by the four evil kings and Abraham comes to Lot's rescue, but they remained separate from each other from that point onward.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreedingSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreedingSlave">Breeding Slave</a>:<ul><li> Sarah's maid, Hagar, is called upon when Sarah realizes she's barren to lie with Abraham and have a child in Sarah's stead. Even though it was her idea, Sarah becomes jealous with Hagar and treats her terribly until she runs away, at which point God has to step in and assure Hagar that she and her son will be protected.</li><li> Both of Jacob's wives eventually are unable to conceive and require Jacob to sleep with their servants in order to have more children.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrideAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrideAndSwitch">Bride and Switch</a>: Jacob works for his uncle Laban for seven years to marry his uncle's youngest daughter Rachel. Come wedding day, though, Laban swaps out Rachel for his oldest daughter Leah, and Jacob doesn't realize the swap took place until after the night of consummation. Laban makes an excuse that it isn't the custom of his people to give away the youngest daughter before the oldest, so Jacob has to work another seven years to have Rachel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeYourArmPunchingOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeYourArmPunchingOutCthulhu">Broke Your Arm Punching Out Cthulhu</a>: Jacob may have pinned the Angel of the Lord or God himself, but he walks with a permanent limp afterward.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryMeNotOnTheLonePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryMeNotOnTheLonePrairie">Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie</a>: Joseph makes the Israelites swear that they would take his body with them when they left Egypt. He was eventually reburied in Israel, meaning that they must have carried his coffin through the desert for forty years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticReligiousWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticReligiousWeirdness">This causes complications along the way</a>, because the people carrying his coffin are therefore ritually impure and can't offer the Passover sacrifice. A "make-up" date for the sacrifice one month later is instituted due to this and other reasons, which means that complications as a result of a will are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButICantBePregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButICantBePregnant">But I Can't Be Pregnant!</a>: More like "but I can't <em>get</em> pregnant" when Sarah, who was in her nineties and way past menopause, overhears from God that she's going to have her husband Abraham's child, which God previously promised would come through Abraham, but only after having her handmaid bear Ishmael did she hear it would be through her as well. Sarah laughs at the possibility, but God proves it by fulfilling the promise and gives her a good reason to laugh, giving the child the name of Isaac ("he laughs").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker">But Liquor Is Quicker</a>: Lot's daughters got their own father drunk to have sex with him. That showed how corrupt Sodom and Gomorrah had been, to the point that even the ones God had spared engaged in sexual immorality.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a>: The fall of man away from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> sees the collapse of the family, best seen in the interaction of the many brothers within this Book. The only way for even a single nation to begin to reconcile with God is for the brothers of the nation to reconcile with each other. For some examples:<ul><li> The conflict of brothers starts with the first children of Adam and Eve, the farmer Cain and the herder Abel. God finds the animal sacrifices of Abel preferable to Cain's offerings, which leaves Cain envious. Some time later, Cain is confronted by God with the fact that he has slaughtered his own brother, a fact Cain denies while complaining that he's "not his brother's keeper." Indignant, God dismisses Cain's lie by describing how he can hear the blood of the first corpse <em>screaming</em> from the Earth, and then punishes Cain to wander the Earth without a place to call home.</li><li> Jacob and Esau, two children who are described as fighting even in the womb, both end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobAndEsau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobAndEsau">the favorite of a different parent</a>, and so each of them works with that parent to conspire against each other for the right of inheritance. Ultimately, first-born Esau is cheated out of his rightful inheritance which now belongs to Jacob, a fact which nearly leads to Esau killing Jacob before the now rightful inheritor flees his home to make his own family. Although if Esau was more mindful of his future inheritance being anything of worth to him than the immediate satisfaction of his appetite, he wouldn't have sold off his birthright to his brother and thus open the door for himself to be cheated in the first place.</li><li> Joseph, the favorite of Jacob's twelve sons, is so envied by his ten older brothers that they sell him into to slavery and tell their father that Joseph was eaten alive. The tables are turned years later, when the older brothers and the youngest (Benjamin) go to Egypt to request food and shelter for Israel from one of the Pharaoh's advisors: an older Joseph, having risen out of slavery by God's grace. Joseph demands that Benjamin be given to him as a slave in return for the provision of Israel, but the other brothers beg for Benjamin's freedom, not wanting to break their father's heart even further. Impressed by their compassion, Joseph reveals himself as their long-lost brother and allows the people of Israel to come to Egypt.</li><li> The last group of brothers are the two sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim. Despite the fact that Manasseh is the older one, Ephraim was the one who received a blessing from the patriarch Jacob. Manasseh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">quietly accepts the situation</a>. Genesis doesn't blow trumpets for Manasseh, but unlike every other older brother who ends up less favored than the younger, he preserves his family over lashing out over his perception of injustice. Rabbi David Wolpe touches on this silent victory for brotherhood <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH0VqlPnzpE">five minutes into this interview<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult">Cargo Cult</a>: The worship of other gods through the use of idols began in this book. Jacob's uncle Laban, in particular, had household gods, which his daughter Rachel stole and hid underneath her camel's saddle and sat upon while making an excuse that she was going through her period when her father came into her tent to look for his missing gods. Jacob also had his sons get rid of the gods they were worshiping, including the earrings they were wearing most likely as part of that worship, and buried them near a tree before they moved on from Shechem.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarpetOfVirility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarpetOfVirility">Carpet of Virility</a>: Goes beyond this for Esau, as the narrative says that even at birth he was "like a hairy garment", which is why he was given the name Esau ("hairy").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a>: When Lot tells his family about God's imminent plan to destroy their town, his soon-to-be sons-in-law and other relatives (including possibly some sons and/or daughters and their spouses) laugh at him, thinking he's joking. On the other hand, this is averted with the story of Noah: although many later stories about Noah (including a brief retelling of the story in the Epistle of Peter) embellish their tale by depicting him trying to tell others about the Flood and failing to convince them, the original text doesn't mention that happening.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChatWithSatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChatWithSatan">A Chat with Satan</a>: In Chapter 3, the serpent, the most cunning of God's creation, convinces the first woman to eat from the one tree God order not to eat from by appealing to man's desire for beauty, great wisdom, and to be god-like, and in turn the woman gives the fruit to the man to eat. Naturally, eating from the tree only manages to get the two expelled from Paradise and cursed with mortality and toil that will be passed to all their descendants. The serpent doesn't get away freely from this, as God reckons all the human descendants will have a bone to pick with him. Interestingly, the serpent is never identified as Satan in this book or in any other part of the Torah; it is only later in Christian writings that the two are connected, specifically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>: Moab and Ben-Ammi, the children of Lot's two daughters, whom they conceived when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">they raped their own father</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker">while he was drunk</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircumcisionAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircumcisionAngst">Circumcision Angst</a>:<ul><li> Many men were left feeling sore the day Abraham applied the commanded custom.</li><li> Invoked by Simeon and Levi, who claim they will let Dinah marry the prince who raped her if every man from that village is circumcised.

The angel had to resort to cursing Jacob's hip in order to win, and Jacob <em>still</em> obtained a blessing (which remains in effect to this day) before he let the angel leave.

They agree to this, but the Disproportionate Retribution only begins when Jacob's sons take advantage of their weakness after the circumcision to kill them all and loot their towns for everything they owned in life. Jacob is furious, but the sons question what else to do in the face of that insidious a crime.</li><li> Young Joseph may have been a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">bratty brother</a>, with his habit of tattling on his older brothers and announcing his dreams of superiority, but trying to murder him and then selling him into slavery in response?

(The other alternate reading is that the "sons of God" were the godly line of Seth and the "daughters of men" were the ungodly line of Cain, and thus their offspring were just people fallen into depraved sin.

After the murder of his brother and his own banishment, Cain travelled further east towards the land of Nod. All this eventually culminated in the human race, now numerous, moving further and further east until they reached a plain called Shinar, where they built the Tower of Babel, an endeavor that resulted in the newly polyglot human race scattering to the four corners of the Earth.

When Abraham is about to sacrifice his son Isaac, God implores him to let him go and sacrifice a ram instead. In Hebrew, there are two ways to formulate a negative sentence: one of them is known as the Prohibitive, the other the Vetative. The former is used when a person talks down to somebody, i.e. is in a superior position. The latter is used when somebody tries to persuade a superior. With one sole other exception every other negative sentence of God in the Tanakh is formulated as a Prohibitive (for example, the Ten Commandments are formulated in a way that makes it very clear that anybody who violates them will suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>), but when God asks (not orders, but <em>asks</em>) Abraham to put down the dagger, it reads the same way as a soldier pleading with his commanding officer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plunder">Plunder</a>: When Simeon and Levi struck the city of Shechem with the sword and rescued their sister Dinah from Shechem, they plundered the city of all its goods before returning home.

Then he gets her to believe that God Himself was lying about the tree, and that if she ate from the tree, her eyes will be opened and she will be like God, "knowing good and evil". When both Adam and Eve eat from the tree together, and are confronted by God over what they have done, and Eve says that the snake deceived her into eating from the tree, God cursed the snake with crawling on his belly and eating dust all the days of his life, and that there will be enmity between his offspring and that of the woman, that "the seed of the woman" shall crush his head while he shall "bruise His heel".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill">Soiled City on a Hill</a>:<ul><li> In the world before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood">The Great Flood</a> in general, men boasted about being seventy-seven times worse than Cain himself and outside of Noah, every man desired only evil in his heart.</li><li> Sodom and Gomorrah is filled with brutal men bent on raping the city's newest visitors without any desire for compromise.

There are oodles of interpretations however, depending on who you ask.<ul><li> Interestingly, the fact that the first mentioned people (Adam and Eve) wear animal skins, and most of the early humans are mentioned to be nomads or pastoral, makes some people think this is referring to the Paleolithic, when most all people were nomads and worked with sticks and stones and wore animal skins.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne">The Unchosen One</a>: Abraham's sons Ishmael and Midian, Isaac's son Esau, and each of Jacob's twelve <em>other</em> sons besides Joseph (along with Joseph's son Manasseh) did not get to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> of their families.

The hero Gideon arose from Manasseh. Judah's tribe, in particular, went on to produce King David's dynasty and eventually none other than Jesus Christ; and the very term "Jews" in our language derives from his tribe's ultimate ascendancy over Israel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">The Underworld</a>: All characters expect to "go down to Sheol" after death.

Since daughters are usually only named in these genealogies when they've got some significant part in these stories, this suggests she was one of the women taken on the Ark with Noah and his sons. His wife, perhaps, or one of his daughters-in-law? Genesis says nothing more about her.</li><li> Some time after their escape from Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction, Lot and his daughters left Zoar "because he was afraid" of something, possibly his wife being turned into a pillar of salt when she turns back to Sodom and is consumed by the fire and brimstone. What became of the people in that town, and why didn't the daughters seek for husbands among them? We're not told.</li><li> No further mention is made of what became of Lot after his daughters make him drink wine and they lie with him to impregnate themselves while he's unconscious and unaware of their incestuous act, and they become the mothers of Moab and Ben-Ammi, ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites.</li><li> After her ugly experience at Shechem, we hear nothing more about what became of Dinah.</li><li> Speaking of Shechem, Simeon and Levi put all the <em>men</em> to the sword there, but not the women and children; the account merely states they "carried them off" along with any valuables they could find. Did they enslave <em>all</em> of this bunch? (If so, how did they keep them in line and avoid their being an encumbrance to their flight from the area?) Did they release them somewhere along the way to speed up their journey? We simply don't know, and aren't told.</li><li> What became of Potiphar and his wife after Joseph got out of prison and promoted to Pharaoh's second-in-command? (Potiphar was an important official in Pharaoh's court, so Joseph would likely have met him there again at some point.)

Near the end, he also curses their "cruel wrath" further while dispensing his final words of wisdom about their heritage from his deathbed. The descendants of Levi and Shimeon, the two brothers who executed said revenge, are the only two tribes which didn&acute;t earn a separate patch of land when they finally entered Canaan after the Exodus. The Levites were ordained priests and temple servants, while the tribe of Shimeon was assigned to military duties.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: In Chapter 39, when Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph into having sex with her, to the effect of saying that nobody will know about it, Joseph refuses on the grounds that, as the head servant of Potiphar's household, nothing has been withheld from him except for Potiphar's wife, and that he cannot go against his master's wishes and thus sin against God, acknowledging that there is One greater than himself who knows what will happen or what has happened.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: Nobody can agree on where the Garden of Eden is supposed to have been located except "somewhere in the Middle East"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19yqt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19yqt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19yqt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">other than Mormons, who believe it was located in Jackson County, Missouri.</span>, as two of the rivers named as its borders have no modern equivalent (and the other two are rather generic names). Some theologians think that wherever it was (Israel is among the candidates), it can no longer be accessed by human means.<ul><li> If archaeology helps, the first people (Homo erectus) came from either East Africa or around Georgia, a country in the Middle East. Homo sapiens/neanderthalensis also originated in Eastern Africa, with the branch that would lead to modern humans staying in Africa while the branch that would lead to neanderthals migrating into Europe.</li><li> As crazy as this may sound to some, Eden <em>may</em> have been a (semi-)real place. A site called "Gobekli Tepe" was unearthed in what is today Turkey (very close to the border it shares with modern-day Syria). The site features stone henges that predate Stonehenge (and similar structures), and, indeed, farming. The henges feature carvings of animals, which may represent which clan each one (and its associated sitting place) was associated with, or totemic animals. Gobekli Tepe was a site where groups of people gathered to celebrate...something, or to remember their ancestors, as evidenced by wild animal bones (that showed signs of butchering and cooking), and containers that seem to have been used for the production of beer. Now, what does all this have to do with Eden? Well, besides the clan sigils or totemic animals on the henges, it's located in about the right spot. (Right between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, with some tributaries.) Additionally, the story (being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory">"Just So" Story</a>) may reflect the hardship of transitioning from a <em>relatively</em> easy hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a farming lifestyle (to produce enough food and drink for a growing population) with all of <em>its</em> challenges. (Living in closer quarters, the uncertainty of the rains, more wear and tear on the body, social stratification, etc.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Sodom and Gomorrah are so terrible that Lot struggles to find another single righteous man <em>even among his own family</em> in it, and the people of the towns immediately try to rape two angels that visit the cities.
