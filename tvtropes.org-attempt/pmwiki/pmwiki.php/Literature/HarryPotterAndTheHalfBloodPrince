First, nobody in the Ministry (if they weren't also an Order of the Phoenix member) stood up for him when Fudge and his lackeys were harassing Harry, Dumbledore, and their supporters out of fear of losing their jobs if they had done so. This makes them all just as guilty for covering up Voldemort's return and allowing the Death Eaters to go on with their plans unopposed for a whole year, so Harry feels no obligation to help them clean up the mess <em>they</em> made. Second, it would also make Harry <em>himself</em> an Accomplice by Inaction; if he gives the impression that he's working with the Ministry, he's also giving his tacit support to their "attempts" to solve the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Problem, which are more about being <em>perceived</em> to be making progress than about actually <em>making</em> progress.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate">Acquitted Too Late</a><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sirius Black</span> is finally found innocent of the mass murder every wizard thought he committed, as Fudge tells the British Prime Minister during the first chapter.

Dumbledore found evidence Voldemort was the real culprit, but Morfin died in Azkaban before the verdict could be overturned.</li><li> Likewise, Voldemort also framed a house-elf named Hokey for poisoning her mistress with the same methods he used to frame his uncle. The Ministry didn't bother investigating the situation any further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">because she was a house-elf.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingUnnatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingUnnatural">Acting Unnatural</a>: Hermione attempts to act casually in Borgin and Burkes, and immediately gets noticed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyIAmHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyIAmHim">Actually, I Am Him</a>: Harry doesn't realise he's talking to the Half-Blood Prince until he tries to use one of the Prince's own spells, at which point the Prince brags about his identity to a distraught Harry.<div class="indent"><strong><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snape</span>:</strong> You dare use my own spells against me?

This despite the following facts: Draco is bragging to his fellow Slytherins about it; his parents and other family members are Death Eaters; Voldemort recruited the original Death Eaters from among his Hogwarts classmates; and, Voldemort himself committed his first murders while he was still a student at Hogwarts. Then again, without any solid proof, Harry builds his case on his personal dislike for Draco, and there are alternative explanations for all his circumstantial evidence. Still, Ron and Hermione have followed Harry into wilder conclusions with less evidence previously, and he's been proven right.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a><ul><li> Snape opens his defence against Bellatrix's accusations with two of these, first asking her if it never occurred to her that Voldemort might have had the same questions when Snape returned to him after 13 years?
