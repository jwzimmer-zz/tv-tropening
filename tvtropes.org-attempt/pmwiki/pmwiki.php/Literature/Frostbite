The story follows Rose Hathaway, a 17 year old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampir">Dhampir</a> who is training to be the guardian to her best friend, Lissa Dragomir, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Moroi</a> princess, with whom she shares a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink">Psychic Link</a>. They train at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfAdventure">Academy of Adventure</a> called Saint Vladimir's Academy for young vampire children and their bodyguards. After spending two years on the run, Lissa and Rose are brought back to the school and are forced to re-acquaint themselves with the student body. They are soon joined by a new bodyguard named Dimitri, who is assigned to Lissa in place of Rose.</p><p>Despite being young adult novels, the books are rather accurate in their portrayal of teenagers. They cuss, drink, make out, have sex or try to. There is very little whitewashing done of the teenaged experience and the book becomes a much more satisfying read due to the realism of the portrayal. While still kept within a PG-13 definition of edgy, the works have gained a substantial adult following in addition to their intended audience.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Has a spinoff series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bloodlines">Bloodlines</a></em>.</p><p><span class="asscaps"> The books, in order of publication:</span></p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Vampire Academy</em> (August 2007)</li><li> <em>Frostbite</em> (April 2008)</li><li> <em>Shadow Kiss</em> (November 2008)</li><li> <em>Blood Promise</em> (August 2009)</li><li> <em>Spirit Bound</em> (May 2010)</li><li> <em>Last Sacrifice</em> (December 2010)</li></ul><p>There are also some short stories: "Sunshine", from the anthology <em>Kisses from Hell</em> (2010); "Homecoming", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foretold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foretold">Foretold</a></em> (2012); and four<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nw9d');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0nw9d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nw9d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"The Turn and the Flame", "From the Journal of Vasilisa Dragomir", "The Meeting", and "Hello, My Name Is Rose Hathaway"</span> in the 10th anniversary edition of the first book, also released separately as <em>Vampire Academy: The Untold Stories</em> (2017).</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmOfTheBook">film adaptation</a> was released in 2014.

A school for Moroi vampires and dhampirs, taught by older Moroi vampires and dhampirs. Plenty of magic going on, political scheming and plots, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">battleground for a Strigoi invasion in <em>Shadow Kiss</em>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>:<ul><li> Rose Hathaway. Pretty much a prerequisite as a guardian, but still. Trained to fight against Strigoi and other threats. Skilled at killing.</li><li> Tasha Ozera. And a pretty badass one too. She was not granted guardians by court. So trained herself in self-defense and offensive magic. She was tutoring others as a defense instructor.</li><li> Any dhampir girl, really. They all tend to be more healthy and athletic than their human counterparts. Even those not fully trained can handle themselves well in fights.</li><li> Any female <em>guardian</em>. They are trained since their school years in combat techniques, aimed at making them fighters against super-strong, super-fast Strigoi vampires. They can fall in battle but usually manage to hold their own.</li><li> Any of the female Keepers. Living in a society where Moroi, humans, and dhampirs co-exist, and fighting skills are praised above all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>: The Moroi are trained in a pacifistic philosophy, learning to not use their magic in either offensive or defensive ways. Which is why they depend on dhampir guardians to protect them from the Strigoi threat. Individuals like Tasha and Christian Ozera rebel against this way of thinking, learning how to fight and training others to do so as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">The Alcatraz</a>: Tarasov prison for Moroi and dhampir criminals and mental patients. Prisoners are held in an exhausted state to prevent escape. The prison moves from Alaska in the summer to other places with abundant sunlight in the winter, so that potential vampire escapees would be exposed to sunlight. Nobody ever escaped <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Rose, Lissa, and Eddie Castile broke Victor Dashkov out</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlibi">The Alibi</a>: In <em>Last Sacrifice</em>, when Rose is framed for regicide, Adrian provides her with an alibi as they spend the night of the murder together. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His mother Daniella Ivashkov then goes to provide him with his own alibi. Bribing a janitor to testify that Adrian arrived in Rose's apartment later than he actually did. So they could not have done the deed together. Problem was that the second alibi was not needed, only complicating things more.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">A Lighter Shade of Black</a>: In-Universe, the Alchemists consider Strigoi, Moroi, and Dhampirs to be all "evil creatures of the night". But they are willing to concede that the latter two are a lighter shade of black. Allowing them to covertly co-operate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGenesAreCodominant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGenesAreCodominant">All Genes Are Codominant</a>: The vampiric Moroi are physically frail (which is compensated for by their elemental magic and healing factors), so they interbreed with humans in order to create dhampirs- which have the strength of full humans and a slight healing factor- to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">protect themselves</a> from the Strigoi. Dhampirs cannot procreate with humans or among themselves, and do not have to drink blood like either vampiric races.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a>: Inna is the willing servant and love interest of Nathan, a handsome Strigoi. Her love interest happens to be evil.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: Aaron is Lissa's and Mia's boyfriend and a royal Moroi. His particular clan is not mentioned in the series. "Vampire Academy: The Ultimate Guide" reveals him to a member of the Drozdov clan. Kind of makes sense since Mia's parents were established as servants to this clan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>:<ul><li> Rose Hathaway. Hoo boy. Though a good person at heart, she definitely fulfils this role at the Academy. Or at least tries to. Popular girl, center of the social scene, and has an attitude.</li><li> Lissa Dragomir. Even more so than Rose, though she has a more agreeable personality. She charms her way into the center of social life at the Academy, using the prestige of her wealth and princess status. She ingratiates herself to all the power players of the social scene, seduces Aaron (her former boyfriend), and all to isolate Mia Rinaldi.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: The Strigoi. They lose all sense of morality when awakened into their new existence. They are all indiscriminate killers, have no loyalty to fellow Strigoi even when allied, and have no appreciation for beauty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">Amicable Exes</a>: Janine Hathaway and Ibrahim "Abe" Mazur had a relationship eighteen years before the main events of the series. They interact closely late in the series and seem to her a very friendly relationship. Rose suspects that they are getting back together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim">Animals Hate Him</a>: Animals dislike dhampirs, while having no problem with the Moroi. The mere presence of a dhampir sets them on edge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Aristocrats Are Evil</a>: There are notable exceptions, but the royals tend to be selfish and spoiled. Non-royal Moroi and dhampirs tend to suffer at their hands.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>: The second, fourth, and sixth books take place primarily outside of the eponymous St. Vladimir's Academy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision">Aura Vision</a>: Nearly all spirit users in the series demonstrate the ability to see auras.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>:<ul><li> One becomes shadow kissed when a spirit user revives them. Essentially what happened to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rose, who died along with Lissa's parents and brother.</span></li><li> Another variation of this is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> spirit can bring Strigoi back from the dead. This happens with two characters. Dimitri and Mrs. Karp.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">Back-to-Back Badasses</a>: Rose often with Dimitri. They co-operate in battle scenes. For example in <em>Spirit Bound</em> they immediately go back-to-back to face the royal guard, and do a good job at taking them out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchComparison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchComparison">Bait-and-Switch Comparison</a>: This conversation between Rose and Dimitri in <em>Shadow Kiss</em>:<div class="indent"> <strong>Rose</strong>: Are you afraid of my possibly insane dark side coming out?</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Dimitri</strong>: No, I&#146;m afraid of your normal Rose Hathaway side coming out, the one that isn&#146;t afraid to jump in without thinking when she believes something is right.</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rose</strong>: Is there a difference?</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Dimitri</strong>: Yes. The second one scares me.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>: Rose and Dimitri. They often fight alongside each other, facing the enemy jointly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">The Beautiful Elite</a>: The Moroi, who all share the characteristic of looking like supermodels. Ironically, because being tall and slender is normal to them, they consider curvy girls and buff guys to be the ideal, which most dhampirs are.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a>:<ul><li> Rose between Mason (Betty) and Dimitri (Veronica). Mason is a close childhood friend, who adores her, and offers her a safe relationship. Dimitri is her older mentor and their relationship is forbidden. Later it's Rose between Dimitri and Adrian, though which one is the Betty or Veronica depends on the situation (usually Dimitri is the Betty but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he's a Strigoi he is definitely a Veronica</span>). Dimitri is more down-to-earth while Adrian is wealthy, glamorous, and likes to show-off. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During Dimitri's Strigoi phase, Adrian offers a safer relationship to Rose and proves devoted, while Dimitri is dangerous and is willing to completely dominate his lover.</span></li><li> Lissa between Aaron (Betty) and Christian (Veronica) in the first book. Aaron is her former boyfriend, first love, and is still crazy about her. But he is boring, while Christian is a fascinating bad boy with an edge.</li><li> Tatiana thinks that Adrian could be the Betty to Lissa's Archie and Christian's Veronica, and that Rose is the Veronica to Adrian's Archie and Lissa's Betty.

Lissa, one of the main characters from the series, is the last in her family line, the Dragomirs, which causes tension as she cannot serve on the council or be elected Queen if she doesn't have at least one living family member, causing tension as her voice is not allowed to be heard.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the last books it is revealed that Lissa's father had an illegitimate child, meaning there is another Dragomir.

This is less a principled stance and more cowardice, because their preference is to let the Dhampir Guardians do the fighting and dying for them, even trying to lower the minimum age for joining the Guardians, i.e. send <em>undertrained teenagers</em> into combat so they don't have to get their hands dirty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalSadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalSadisticChoice">Suicidal Sadistic Choice</a>: In <em>Frostbite</em>, Isaiah the Strigoi gave his captive Moroi, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Christian Ozera and Mia Rinaldi</span>, a sadistic choice.

The most obvious change comes from the style of clothes the characters wear. In the books, the students of the Academy wear regular street clothes. It is a sore spot for Rose that she can't afford decent clothing, at one point wearing clothes she received from the Salvation Army. In the films, both Moroi and dhampir students wear school uniforms. Rose wears a relatively stylish uniform.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Spared by the Adaptation</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The character Mr. Nagy/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">"Mr. Meisner"</a> is killed by Natalie Dashkov in the book.
