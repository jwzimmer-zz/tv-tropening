So far it is comprised of the following sub-series:<p></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><ul><li> <em>The Farseer</em> <br>First trilogy about Fitz, a royal bastard who grows up at a court threatened from within and without.<p></p></li><li> <em>The Liveship Traders</em> <br>A trilogy about the traders of Bingtown, to the south of the Six Duchies.<p></p></li><li> <em>The Tawny Man</em> <br>Second trilogy about Fitz, taking place fifteen years after <em>The Farseer</em>.<p></p></li><li> <em>The Rain Wild Chronicles</em> <br>A quartet picking up loose ends from <em>The Liveship Traders</em>.<p></p></li><li> <em>Fitz and the Fool</em> <br>Third trilogy about Fitz, largely set another twenty years after <em>The Tawny Man</em>.</li></ul><p>There are also the related stories "Homecoming", "The Inheritance", "Words Like Coins", "Blue Boots" and "Cat's Meat" and the novella <em>The Willful Princess and the Piebald Prince</em>.</p><p>The various trilogies and stories follow different characters and are written in somewhat different styles, and could be read independently of one another. The three trilogies about Fitz form one group, with the other two series being more loosely linked to one another. Nonetheless, all five series form different parts of a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">overarching narrative</a> and characters from one series will reappear in others to make cameos or as supporting characters; and the books thus make the best sense when read in the order above. Though no one character appears in every book, the central characters of the series might be said to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a> FitzChivalry Farseer, a royal bastard trained to be an assassin, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">enigmatic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Fool</a>, a mystic prophet with an ambiguous agenda.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Although plenty happens over the course of the series, compared to many fantasy series the books are primarily character-driven and focus to a great extent on the concerns, motivations, feelings and conflicts of their main characters, with a common theme being the conflict between characters' own desires and their duties to their King or their people, their friends, or their families (or sometimes all three). Characters frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">change</a> over the course of the books. Whilst the series does have definite heroes and villains, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality">characters are rarely either entirely noble nor irredeemably evil</a> and just as the villains have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">backstories</a> that go some way to explaining their motivations, the heroes too are often motivated by violence and vengeance (or for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">the Greater Good</a>) into doing things that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">aren't strictly heroic</a>. The series has plenty of dark moments, but nonetheless on the whole does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull">lean towards</a> the idealistic side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">scale</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The series walks the line between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">Low Fantasy</a> without ever clearly falling into either camp. The medieval setting, plots revolving around the rise and fall of Kingdoms, magic, dragons, prophecies about the fate of the world etc. are all archetypical of high fantasy, but the focus on individual human characters and their internal problems, as well as the moral ambiguity discussed above, are more typical of low fantasy.</p><p>The first trilogy should not be confused with the novel <em>Farseer</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> novel by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamKing">William King</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix">Gotrek &amp; Felix</a> fame.</p><hr><h2> Tropes not exclusive to any of the series:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Despite being a pseudo-medieval kingdom, the Six Duchies have an enlightened approach towards women, who frequently feature as warriors, soldiers and guards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictiveMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictiveMagic">Addictive Magic</a>: Skill-users suffer from an addiction to Skilling that can cause truly terrible physical pain and mental distraction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fitz suffers especially from this addiction thanks to Galen actively trying to keep him from learning to Skill properly.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis">Advanced Ancient Acropolis</a>: Kelsingra and several other ruined ancient Elderling cities found on the banks of the Rain Wild River and only accessible by using a liveship or taking the long, Skill-wrought road leading there from the Mountain Kingdom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Due to their proximity to and co-habitation with dragons the Elderlings were able to take advantage of the latter's magic and develop what amounts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>, yet their cities were destroyed in a cataclysm so devastating it changed even the course of the coastline.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: Characters such as Fitz, Burrich, Regal, and Chade...as well as Molly and Will. Possibly a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>, as the characters with "normal names" are introduced in the first book and are out of the picture by the end of the first trilogy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: Fitz's is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> in <em>Assassin's Apprentice</em>, but it is made clear that some kind of decline has taken place from an earlier time when the kings of the Six Duchies had treaties with magical beings from beyond the mountains. The Skill, formerly the preserve of many in the Six Duchies, is now known only to the royal family and the Skillmaster. Over the course of the series, we slowly learn more about the now-gone Elderling civilization.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">Ambiguous Gender</a>: In the <em>Farseer</em> trilogy there's the Fool, who the narrator Fitz believes is male. The <em>Liveship Traders</em> trilogy has a totally different dramatis personae, including the female Amber. It's never stated that these two are the same person, but more and more clues are dropped as the trilogy progresses, and because Amber advises Althea on how to disguise herself as a boy we start to think he/she is really female and was disguised as male in the earlier books. But in the <em>Tawny Man</em> trilogy, where we and Fitz are told outright that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both characters are the same person</span>, there's a section where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fitz inhabits the Fool's body and can presumably tell what sex he/she is, but never tells us! Fitz implies that the Fool's kind are so different from humans that neither gender is appropriate &mdash; but then there's the Pale Woman to account for, who is clearly female, leading to the conclusion that not all Whites are the same</span>. This is in line with the Fool's claim that where he comes from, people don't insist on the existence of only two genders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Ambiguously Human</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Whites</span>, and by extension the White Prophets. Easily mistaken for albinos when young, their skin, eyes and hair darken throughout the course of their lives to golden and eventually to chestnut brown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whenever one of their prophecies has been fulfilled and the world nudged from its set course.</span> Subtle hints like their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">longevity</a> and something slightly off about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Fool's</span> wrists clue Fitz in as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Fool then says that no, the Whites were not human, and neither is he, though it is later revealed that they are born to human parents</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyeSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyeSpy">Animal Eye Spy</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed">Discussed</a>. In the Six Duchies it is generally assumed that the Witted can see through animal eyes. That is not so. As Fitz and others point out, they cannot see through their bond animals' eyes, yet the idea that the Witted could be spying on them creeps many people out to such an extent that &mdash; combined with other superstitions &mdash; it's a direct cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>: The Fool was originally intended to be a minor supporting character, if a somewhat mysterious one, which explains why he goes from being largely absent in the first part of <em>Assassin's Apprentice</em>, at least compared to his later prominence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascended to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>: The implied fate of someone who gives themselves up to the Skill. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fitz several times encounters Verity in the Skill river, as well as Chade after his death, with the two of them offering obtuse advice. There&#146;s likewise strong hinting that this happened to many of the original Elderlings, in their rush to escape the catastrophe that befell their civilization.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BazaarOfTheBizarre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BazaarOfTheBizarre">Bazaar of the Bizarre</a>: Bingtown has the Rain Wild Street, where the exotic and expensive, potentially magically imbued merchandise of the mysterious Rain Wild Traders can be bought. It's so expensive, many of the shops have hired guards. Fitz mentions how just walking down the street dizzied him due to his heightened senses of the Wit and the Skill.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>: The dragons perceive the world completely different than humans do. For dragons, they are the kings and queens of the world, and the world and everything in it exists only to make sure the dragons are doing well. It is impossible to make a dragon understand that humans have different priorities, so that the humans have to resort to offering the dragons bargains which benefit the latter to get them to do something not of their immediate concern.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">Bond Creatures</a>: Those with the Wit choose animal partners with whom they share their lives, often assuming certain traits typical for the animal. If all goes well, it's an enrichment for both parties; if things go south, both lose their ability to live among their own kind.

The most frequently encountered is the Skill, a form of magic associated with the Farseer bloodline and with Elderlings. It allows users to communicate over long distances, to influence the thoughts of others, and even - if the user is sufficiently powerful - to make them do things the user wants. It can also be used to heal wounds, albeit at the cost of physically draining both user and patient.</li><li> The Wit allows the user to communicate with some animals, and to form emotional and psychic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">links</a> with certain receptive animals. It can also sometimes be used to repel and harm assailants if the user is being attacked.</li><li> This gets a bit more complicated as the series goes along. <em>Humans</em> perceive major dualistic differences between what they term the Skill and the Wit. But, dragons and liveships... really don't. Elderlings also had a different take on things. And, as Fitz discovers, the more potent uses of the Skill that he can do (often by accident) require simultaneous use of the Wit and visa versa. For so long, he worries about "contaminating" his Skill with the Wit, that it takes him a very long while to spot that they can boost and help each other (and, in fact, are needed in tandem to e.g. wake stone dragons &mdash; successful coteries probably had a Wit-capable user, if only to some vestigial degree, in the group... even if they were not all aware of it). There are hints of other sides of the magic coin beyond the Wit and Skill, as well &mdash; hedge witchcraft, priestly uses of what could be both the Wit and the Skill, however the Fool's prophecy works...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantCity">Merchant City</a>:<ul><li> Bingtown, situated near the mouth of the Rain Wild River on the Cursed Shores.

As the society has grown more prosperous, it has adopted the Chalcedan norm of "keeping women idle" to show off one's prosperity, to the point where Althea has to pose as a man to get any work on a ship and Keffria is completely at a loss for how to function when Kyle unexpectedly doesn't return because she was never given the freedom to make decisions on her own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a>: The tenor of Bingtown society is more conservative than Six Duchies, and the shaming women face is more severe. Althea in particular gets a lot of it, including from her own sister in one important incident from their youth.

Althea feels like this when her family pressures to be more conventional and her father leaves <em>Vivacia</em> to Kyle. (Funnily enough, Keffria at one point expresses jealousy that her younger sister grew up doing basically whatever she wanted, while Keffria was a good, obedient daughter but never rewarded for it.) Kyle actively favors Malta while he verbally and emotionally abuses Wintrow and Selden is basically a non-entity to him. Brashen was disinherited, although he did genuinely embarrass his family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a>: Kennit, especially to Etta, such as when she cuts his leg off to save him from being eaten by a sea serpent, he accuses her of trying to kill him.<ul><li> Tintaglia initially just flies off after she is freed by Malta, Reyn and Selden and only comes back for Reyn and Selden when she senses them dying and realises she's going to need humans who can understand her if she is to help the serpents, giving Malta up for dead entirely until Reyn refuses to cooperate with her until she finds Malta. It's somewhat a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, but Tintaglia <em>is</em> called out on how entitled she is.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a>: Rache to Ronica, refusing to leave Ronica's side even when the Vestrit's have all their wealth stripped from them and are embroiled in a political conspiracy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>: Kennit's dream is to be King of the Pirate Isles and over the course of the trilogy, he manages to pull of great feats by a combination of astonishing luck and pragmatism. He begins using Vivacia to attack slaveships - not because he gives a damn about slaves, but because if he does, he gets free labourers out of those who want to stay aboard and those who want to return to their islands will worship him as a hero, plus he gets to keep all the loot on the ships. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His publicity is so good that by the climax of the trilogy nearly everyone sans Althea, Malta and Brashen remember Kennit as a legendary pirate and Etta is made Queen of the Pirate islands because she was "Kennit's woman" and carries his child.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">Violently Protective Girlfriend</a>: Etta, to Kennit.
