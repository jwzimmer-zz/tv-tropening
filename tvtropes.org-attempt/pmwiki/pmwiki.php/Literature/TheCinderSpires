Grimm is a disgraced former officer from Spire Albion's Fleet who commands the <em>Predator</em>, a privateer vessel that he uses against Albion's enemies, while Gwen Lancaster is the daughter of the Prime Minister and the heir to the largest Crystal Vattery in Albion, and Bridget is the last scion of a noble house that no longer has either fortune or political power.

Grimm is not happy to explain that the ship had been the <em>Predator</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a>: A point of dealing with cats. Most of them will refer to humans by descriptors rather than anything approaching their names. When cats take the time to name a human, it indicates either ownership or respect. Bridget is named Littlemouse by Rowl and the Silent Paws, while her father is also named, because the cats have adopted the Tagwynn family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rowl takes it upon himself to give Grimm the name Grim Ship-Trees out of respect, which startles Bridget, who didn't think Rowl would ever <em>respect</em> a human.</span></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: The story takes place some two thousand years after an unexplained event changed the laws of nature and required humanity to abandon the surface of the world and hole up in the Spires. Or alternatively, it's set on an alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> that humanity colonised, after which they entered a Dark Age and lost most of their technological knowledge and history.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan">All According to Plan</a>: Gwen violently rebels against her mother's wishes at the beginning of the book, and blasts her way out of her house to go join the Spirearch's Guard. Only after she leaves does Gwen's mother point out that Gwen is so contrary that trying to force her to stay was actually the best way to get her to <em>go</em>, which is what her mother wanted all along.<ul><li> Subverted in the rest of the book, however: no one's plans go according to plan, and the person or team that manages to improvise best is usually the one that wins.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbomination">Animalistic Abomination</a>: It's very obliquely hinted that the silkweavers and other surface creatures aren't entirely natural, that they "don't belong" in the world of the Spires. Whether this is merely figurative or not is unclear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker">Apologetic Attacker</a>: Bridget apologizes to Benedict during their sparring practice before heaving him across the room.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssKickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssKickingEqualsAuthority">Ass Kicking Equals Authority</a>: Standard practice among the cats, since the clan leaders are expected to lead the defense of their Clan from the front. Doesn't seem to necessarily have a hereditary component, but the two presumptive heirs shown are both the kits of current clan leaders. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rowl manages to get the Nine-Claws to follow him by kicking the crap out of their presumptive heir.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">Awesome McCoolname</a>: Seems to be a theme with Albion warships (<em>Predator</em>, <em>Thunderous</em>, <em>Glorious</em>, etc.).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">Back-to-Back Badasses</a>:<ul><li> Gwen and Benedict.

Many of them are former Marines, after all, and the rest... well, the doors are sealed up, so they don't have anywhere to go, do they?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>: Brother Vincent of the Temple of the Way. The kind, saffron robe-wearing, non-warriorborn beats down the powerful Benedict with ease and is said to have been doing this since they met. It is implied the other men who take to guarding the entrance are as equally capable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>The Aeronaut's Windlass</em> ends with the Aurorans having set out and accomplished almost everything they could hope for. Spire Albion's merchant dock is crippled, several vessels were destroyed, and they got the book they were seeking as Madame Cavendish memorized its contents. All the heroes managed to do was mitigate the victory a little by securing two copies of the book for themselves, saving the Lancaster Vattery, and achieving the minor morale-boost of taking out a symbolically important Auroran ship.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BawdySong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BawdySong">Bawdy Song</a>: A shanty called "Farmer Long's Pickle". It has a seemingly infinite number of verses, as sailors have been singing it for centuries and have been making up new verses as they go, with the best (or worst) being retained and passed on to future generations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes">Beware the Silly Ones</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Master Ferus</a> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent">Etherealist</a> who sometimes forgets to put on clothes at home and believes doorknobs to be "extremely complex technology". He is also probably the single most dangerous person encountered in the first novel due to his control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName">etheric energy</a>; when he is ambushed by three Auroran marines in his home his only sadness is for how bad it will be when he kills them.</li><li> Folly, Ferus' apprentice, wears extremely mismatched clothes, and can only talk to people via a jar of lumen crystals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She uses those crystals to electrocute a swarm of larval silk-weavers, and resists the attempts the "Enemy" makes to brainwash and enslave her.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>: The view of Wayists is basically this. They believe in no particular dogma, adhering to a Way all must follow, but rather be yourself, be a good person and you will find your own Way. This is reflected in their hallway, where there is a long and winding path through it, but no one will think less of a person who decides to not follow the generationally-worn path in favor of the shortest path to the next door and crossing across the floor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>:<ul><li> When Bridget and Folly are being held prisoner, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grimm leads the crew of the <em>Predator</em> and the local verminocitor guild in a rescue and fight against the mature silkweavers</span>.</li><li> When the crew of the <em>Predator</em> and the verminocitors are surprised by the silkweaver ambush and nearly overwhelmed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rowl leads the cats of the Nine-Claws clan in an attack</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: Madame Cavendish, for most of the novel. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Albion etherealists eventually deduce that she is just working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>, and nickname her "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">Puppet Woman</a>". This is because she manipulates people (and creatures) like puppets, but she is also being manipulated in turn.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of the protagonists survive, they retrieve two copies of the book that Madame Cavendish was after, and Grimm takes down the battlecruiser that wrecked <em>Predator</em> at the beginning of the book &#151; implied to be the best battlecruiser in the entire Auroran fleet. However, the Landing Docks were destroyed, which will have severe economic and military implications, the monks of the Temple of the Way were slaughtered and its Great Library burned, Madame Cavendish rewrites the book she was after and an Albion heavy cruiser was lost with nearly all hands thanks to Rook's cowardice &#151; which he got away with.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>: Cats don't think about the world in the same way humans do, and they find it difficult verging on impossible to believe that humans <em>don't</em> think as they do.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoatLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoatLights">Boat Lights</a>: Folly has one green/blue, and one orange-brown eye.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">Boom, Headshot!</a>: When Gwen realizes that the Guard officer she encountered is actually an Auroran marine in disguise, she calmly blasts him directly in the face with her gauntlet from five feet away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringInsult">Boring Insult</a>: When cats from different clans meet, to establish dominance they will just ignore each other. The first to relent is the lesser of the two. When Rowl meets with another cat and ends up in this situation, he and his opposition <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ignore each other for well over <em>three hours</em>. It ends in a draw between them, partially due to having to deal with other events.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheBonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheBonds">Breaking the Bonds</a>: Bridget takes advantage of how leather will stretch when wet &#151; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with her own blood</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bullying a Dragon</a>: Benedict cites this as the reason the gangs of Habble Landing avoid the territory around the Temple of the Way.

However, this is because Etheric currents flow directly through them &#151; the cost is that the energies eat away at their minds and sanity, requiring them to adopt various compulsions to compensate. Force an etherealist to break their compulsion, and they become lost and incoherent. And the longer they're in the business, the worse their situation becomes. As Folly explains to Bridget at one point, Etherealists end up with "holes" in their minds, and the compulsions help them focus and "fill the holes".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">Cats Are Mean</a>: Jim even described them as "horrid little bullies" in an interview.<div class="indent"><strong>Jim:</strong> I see that you enjoy having no rodents in your warehouse.

However, while characters frequently pray to "God In Heaven", there is no equivalent God-presence in the story. However, there's mention that "archangels" have been spotted at the beginning of the story, and the Cavendish mentions that the plan to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"pull them out of Heaven"</span> requires certain knowledge, implying that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Devil wants to draw God out for a final battle</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a>: After the final battle, the dead aeronauts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on both sides, Albion and Auroran alike</span> are placed on a raft that floats a hundred yards or so off the ship and fired upon with one of the ship's cannons.

Long guns operate on the same principles as Gauntlets, but are larger versions intended for greater distances/accuracy (Rifles instead of pistols). Do not use them against an etherealist, however; they will turn your own energy against you.

The in-universe reason for why guns aren't used even when they would be superior to gauntlets is that iron and steel that aren't protected by copper rapidly rust and decay due to some property of the atmosphere (perhaps increased oxygen levels), and the explosive powder that guns use is highly corrosive to copper. The average pistol barrel cannot withstand more than fifty or so shots before it becomes unusable, so it requires the money to constantly buy new pistol components for a person to train with a gun long enough to be any good with it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grimm made that effort.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>:<ul><li> Espira <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kills</a> a verminocitor rather than send him "up the ropes" while still alive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">i.e. to the silkweaver nest.</span> This comes back to impact him, though, when the body is examined and it is determined that he was <em>not</em> killed by vicious vermin.</li><li> Grimm considers the prospect of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the prisoners of war he captured being sent to work at the base of the spire</span> to be this.<div class="indent"><strong>Grimm:</strong> I've seen that place.

A mistmaw is a giant creature which inhabits the misty airs of the surface; we do not get many details of what they look like, but they're enormous (enough to swallow <em>Predator</em> whole), only aggressive at certain times of the year, attracted to powered webbing and are spoken of with genuine fear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGirlTinyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGirlTinyGuy">Huge Girl, Tiny Guy</a>:<ul><li> Captain Ransom is a head taller than her ex-husband, Captain Grimm.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Benedict isn't exactly short, but Bridget still towers over him.

Addison is quick to claim that he has very little real power anymore and just likes the tea shop and its owners. However, for all his protests that his position is obsolete and merely formal, he has no difficulty in wielding large amounts of power and influence behind the scenes by being a self-admitted world-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> - as Gwen observes when she looks around his apparently harmless private study, it's actually a throne-room in every way that matters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a>: The Captain of the ship is not the cook.

If you can get there, it opens up new tactical possibilities, but it's implied to be dangerous: the light of the sun at those heights can be completely blinding, and if you run out of etheric currents, your ship is becalmed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirate">Sky Pirate</a>:<ul><li> As an Albion privateer, Grimm and <em>Predator</em> are certainly considered as such by Spire Aurora; enough so that they send the legendary <em>Itasca</em> to hunt him down.</li><li> Captain Calliope Ransom and the <em>Mistshark</em> will take on any work that anyone will pay them for and engage in piracy between jobs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar">Space Cold War</a>: Between Spires Albion and Aurora at the start of <em>Windlass</em>, with the two fleets skirmishing and <em>Predator</em> acting as a (deniable) privateer on behalf of Spire Albion. The events of the book ignite it into a fully fledged war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Espira and Ciriaco's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> of the verminocitor that Cavendish tortured comes back to bite their plans in the backside, since when his body is found Benedict takes one look at it, deduces the man was dead before the silkweavers got to him &#151; the broken neck was something of a giveaway &#151; and sets the heroes on the trail of the villains.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeaksFluentAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeaksFluentAnimal">Speaks Fluent Animal</a>: Very few people can understand Cat, enough that most people don't even consider them more than clever animals instead of an intelligent race in their own right. Bridget can speak it, and Rowl (a cat) is a main character. Grimm and the crew of <em>Predator</em> do not believe cats to be intelligent, but Grimm is quick to pick up on Rowl's intelligence, and by the end of the book has one-sided conversations with two different cats, who respond as best they can.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">Spot of Tea</a>: Madame Cavendish frequently engages in a full tea sitting because of her obsession with "proper" etiquette.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a>: The author's take on the genre.

If she needs to speak with a person, then others in the team, like Creedy, Benny, Bridgette, or himself, will be there to listen. That she feels horrible and doesn't wish to tell others to make them experience things second-hand is proof of her humanity.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge">Stronger with Age</a>: Power crystals, unlike most kinds of etheric crystal, get more and more efficient with use, needing at least 100 years to be considered properly broken-in. This means <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Predator</em>'s <em>millennia</em>-old crystal</span> is one of the most powerful and valuable crystals in existence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Supersoldier</a>: Warriorborn, like Benedict and Ciriaco, are considerably faster and stronger than regular humans.

Gwen, on the other hand, is a five-foot noblewoman who is described as looking like a porcelain doll, who is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a> who smooths the paths she takes in life with swift, uncompromising violence.

It is, for all intents and purposes, nigh-indestructible and beyond the means of the contemporary inhabitants to reproduce. It took generations of work for the inhabitants of Habble Landing to bore a hole through the side of the Spire to build their airship yard and docks, and the process is described less as "drilling" or "digging" and more as "wearing away".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">Unwanted Assistance</a>:<ul><li> Gwen accidentally triggers the duel between Bridget and Reggie by inserting herself into the situation and trying to force Reggie to back off.</li><li> At one point when Bridget's trying to negotiate with the Aurorans who are holding her hostage, Gwen tries to interject.

Had she simply destroyed or dumped it, <em>Windlass</em> would have been a major victory for her side. As it is, Captain Grimm manages to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">take back the collection, turning the events of <em>Windlass</em> into more or less a draw</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakingNonSequitur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakingNonSequitur">Waking Non Sequitur</a>: Folly utters what really isn't one when she wakes up in the middle of a life or death battle against silkweavers:<div class="indent"><strong>Folly:</strong> Oh! We escaped!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">What a Piece of Junk</a>: While not junk exactly, <em>Predator</em> is an old, small vessel still showing signs of damage from its last encounter... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is equipped with both an overpowered core crystal, an overpowered lift crystal originally made for the biggest class of ship on the fleet, and overpowered trim crystals, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> more powerful than its size should allow.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>: If Bridget's initial reaction is anything to go by, it's pretty common for the occupants of the Spires to be agoraphobic. The first time she went outside she started to panic when she realized there wasn't a roof over her head anymore. Justified: the setting is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> so most people live their entire lives inside the Spires, and on top of that the unshielded sunlight will drive you insane.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>: Whatever it is that etherealists do has a price in sanity and/or plain rationality. All of them inevitably become permanently catatonic at one point or another. In a twist, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolanders</a> who <em>aren't</em> dangerous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomenAreSafeWithUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomenAreSafeWithUs">The Women Are Safe with Us</a>: Played with. When Bridget is trying to negotiate the end of a Mexican standoff between Ciriaco, his soldiers and her friends by allowing herself to be taken as hostage, she believes she'll probably be "raped and murdered". Ciriaco sincerely tells her that if such a situation had played out, he would have gutted any man who tried to lay a hand on her. "If it had to be death, I'd have given it to you quick and clean." Bridget is not particularly comforted by this knowledge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>: Heavily borrows from this genre.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XenoFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XenoFiction">Xeno Fiction</a>: The chapters from Rowl's perspective, which obviously includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansThroughAlienEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansThroughAlienEyes">Humans Through Alien Eyes</a>. He has a completely different moral system and outlook than a human, even though they overlap well enough to understand each other, and while he's very intelligent in many ways there are things he just can't understand about human society.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCalledMeXItMustBeSerious">You Called Me "X"; It Must Be Serious</a>: During a crisis, Gwen is relieved to see some of the Guard ready and on hand. Benedict gently calls her "Gwendolyn" and notes they shouldn't get in these men's way. Gwen realizes Benedict never calls her by her proper name and quickly deduces these "Guards" are infiltrators, as in the confusion of the attack starting 15 minutes ago, no patrol would be that ready and prepared unless they were already aware of what would be happening.</li></ul><p></p><hr>
