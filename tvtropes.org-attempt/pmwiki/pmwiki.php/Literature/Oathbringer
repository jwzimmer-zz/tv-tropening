Kaladin and Shallan revealed their Surgebinding abilities and opened the way to Urithiru, fabled city of the Radiants. Once there, Dalinar bound the Stormfather himself as his spren, and Renarin revealed himself to be a Truthwatcher.

He cheerily tells her that Shallan did her job for her, before they begin the long walk back to civilization together.</p><p>And Szeth-son-Neturo, formerly the Assassin in White, has been inducted into the Skybreaker Order by Nalan'Elin, Herald of Justice himself. Nale tells him that he should never have been made Truthless, but praises him for holding to his ideals regardless. Now, it is time to return to punish the Shin for their crimes.

In fact, Sadeas boasted about doing just that, which is why Adolin killed him.<div class="indent"><strong>Palona:</strong> Well!

Dalinar tells a story about how he was taught to tie his takama (a shirt for sword duels) three times instead of two, and how his master refused to allow him to do it any other way, because that's how <em>his</em> master taught him. Dalinar found his master's master, and he said the same thing.

Specifically, if he&#146;s trying to achieve personal peace and claiming to feel no guilt, "why do you still hurt?"

Adolin once again demonstrates he's smarter than he looks when he says he once noticed that one of his girlfriends was having "woman troubles" four times a month.

The recruits are told to hunt down the prisoners and bring them back dead or alive; the test proctors already have received writs of execution for all of them. Szeth realizes that the reason the prisoners were able to escape was because the prison was of shoddy construction with only one guard&mdash;the warden had been spending the absolute minimum amount of money and pocketing the rest.

They are also careful not to work their slaves to exhaustion and excuse slaves who are simply too weak to do the job (though they keep an eye out for slaves just <em>pretending</em> to be too weak to do the job) and keep them well-equipped as necessary.

When two Fused encounter a crowd of them that the heroes are trying to hide among in Shadesmar, one proposes stabbing all of the illusions to find the real people hiding among them. His companion uses a knife to draw some blood and flick it at the illusions. The blood sticks to Adolin, who was hiding among them, and he's immediately made out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster">The Spymaster</a>: Dalinar names Aladar Highprince of Information. His first task is to discover who killed Sadeas. Dalinar is of course completely unaware that it was his own son.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a>: Due to his Alethi values, Kaladin feels a bit weird about using Syl as a weapon. He mostly gets over it once she points out that roughly half of his previous weapons have been female.<ul><li> The Alethi culture as a whole is getting its gender norms about women not being allowed to fight overturned in an awful hurry. As multiple characters point out, it doesn't matter if the Alethi care about such things &mdash; the <em>spren</em> don't, and refusing to take advantage of 50% of your Radiants is madness. Plus, Jasnah and Shallan are already out there setting the precedents, so it's too late in any case.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Character</a>: Subverted; despite Taravangian being a half-insane genocidal murderer, he has a conversation with Dalinar on the nature of justice where he defends his position and makes several good points. Specifically, Dalinar tells him of a parable from <em>The Way of Kings</em> where a dying man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisNameIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisNameIs">tells people that three people worked together to kill him</a>, but there are four suspects. Taravangian says he would have had all four executed (once it becomes clear that they can't determine which ones are actually guilty), because the important thing is to stop the murders, and one dead innocent is a small price to pay. Dalinar doesn't agree, but he has to admit that Taravangian's logic is sound.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">Super Empowering</a>:<ul><li> Radiants can have "squires" who share in their powers without having a spren themselves. They retain these powers at a very long range, but not an infinite one; Lopen was able to use Stormlight in the previous book while he was in the warcamps and Kaladin on the Shattered Plains, but Bridge Four loses their powers when they are in Urithiru and Kaladin flies to Hearthstone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vathah becomes Shallan's first squire.</span></li><li> The Unmade Ba-Ado-Mishram gave the Parshmen their forms and powers, and her binding, apparently more violent than expected, was what turned them into slaves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissCheeseSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissCheeseSecurity">Swiss Cheese Security</a>: Moash lampshades that the Fused don't need to be guarded because even if one of them is killed, they can revive themselves in the next Everstorm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction">Talking Is a Free Action</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> in one of the book's worst <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerkers">Tear Jerkers</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elokhar gets within <em>a single word</em> of speaking the First Ideal...only for Moash to stab him in the back before he can finish</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease">The Tease</a>: Navani, sort of. She wants her flirting with Dalinar to advance, but he is firmly against it, so she turns into this.<div class="indent"><strong>Navani:</strong> Your stubborn refusal to get seduced is making me question my feminine wiles.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">This Is Gonna Suck</a>: This is the prevailing mood in the room when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jasnah becomes queen.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">Throw the Dog a Bone</a>: After almost a decade of his life getting progressively worse, of failing to protect everyone he cares about, and then returning home to see his town destroyed by the Everstorm, Kaladin finds his parents alive, and with a new little brother to boot. And then when Roshone tries to treat him like a slave, Kaladin decks him in the face.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsuspectinglySoused" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsuspectinglySoused">Unsuspectingly Soused</a>: Lighteyes only drink wine, so when Shallan goes to a darkeyed bar, she ends up downing four shots of some <em>very</em> hard liquor without considering the consequences. Thankfully, when she uses some Stormlight she's instantly sober again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">Villain Has a Point</a>:<ul><li> Kaladin has trouble arguing with some of the points that the Parshmen make after their souls are healed.</li><li> Amaram is an odd case, because he manages to make several perfectly accurate and true points, especially about Dalinar's past and morality, while also totally going against his own arguments. In a rather glaring hypocrisy, he accuses Dalinar of hiding behind a facade of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">I Did What I Had to Do</a>", which is somewhat true but to a much lesser extent than it's true for Amaram himself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Dalinar manifests Honor's Perpendicularity, Odium <em>freaks</em> and quickly flees</span>.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After failing to accomplish anything as the new Sadeas and switching sides to go with Odium, Amaram is just barely holding it all together. Then Kaladin points out his hipocrisy, and he loses it for good.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsOutShopping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsOutShopping">Villains Out Shopping</a>: When Kaladin first finds the transformed Parshmen who escaped from various towns across Alethkar, he finds them trying to play cards using half-remembered rules. This is what leads Kaladin to realize that the situation is more complicated than he had been expecting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>:<ul><li> Dalinar is relieved beyond words when King Taravangian agrees to ally with him, completely unaware that he's the one who sent Szeth killing around the world. Taravangian also managed to get a Radiant on his side, which makes him look even better - however, she is a Dustbringer and their spren are mostly interested in smashing things (and still mad at old Radiants).</li><li> Amaram is promoted to Highprince of the Sadeas Princedom in part due to the fact that he has the respect of the soldiers. The little detail about him being a thief and a murderer is swept under the rug, despite Dalinar's annoyance. Amaram insists that they can put him on trial <em>after</em> the Desolation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: According to the Stormfather, this was why the Fused were so unstoppable, even before they gained Surgebinding abilities. While the singers lost the same number of bodies either way, (since the fusion process essentially kills the host singer), the ability to trade common "civilian" singers for their most skilled and experienced warriors gave them a huge advantage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: Gavilar apparently thought that causing the Desolation was the only way to bring back the Radiants... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">missing the point entirely</a>, but still.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">We Used to Be Friends</a>: While we already knew in theory that their relationship used to be much better, Dalinar's flashbacks show him, Sadeas, Navani and Ialai interacting very cordially and with a lot of good-natured banter, in contrast to the barely restrained contempt they treat each other with in the present day. Navani also wistfully recalls how she and Ialai used to work together for Gavilar's cause.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: As usual, there a lot of huge reveals and key moments. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dalinar <em>creating/opening a Perpendicularity</em> still stands out.</span><div class="indent"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He slammed both hands together.
