<p><em>I Heard That Song Before</em> is a crime suspense novel written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHigginsClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHigginsClark">Mary Higgins Clark</a>, first published in 2007.</p><p>Twenty-seven year old Kay Lansing marries forty-two year millionaire Peter Carrington after a whirlwind romance. However, mere weeks after their wedding old rumours surface of Peter's suspected involvement in the disappearance of his girlfriend, Susan Althorp, over two decades ago, after Susan's dying mother hires detective Nicholas Greco to investigate. As if that weren't enough, four years ago Peter's pregnant wife Grace drowned in their swimming pool, with some suspecting the tragedy was no accident. Kay is initially convinced that her new husband could never harm anyone. But then she discovers Peter is a sleepwalker and during one such episode, witnesses him with his hand in the pool, either attempting to pull something out...or push something in.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>As evidence against Peter mounts, Kay begins to wonder just what Peter is capable of, knowingly or otherwise. Then there's a mysterious argument six year old Kay overheard in the Carrington mansion the day Susan disappeared, which may hold the key to everything. But will Kay live long enough to uncover the truth, or will she meet the same fate as the other women in Peter's life?</p><hr><h2>Contains examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: Eighteen year old Susan Althorp disappeared and there's been no trace of her for twenty-two years...until her strangled, partially-skeletal corpse turns up buried not far from her home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance">Age-Gap Romance</a>: Kay is twenty-seven when she marries her husband, forty-two-year-old Peter Carrington. The age gap between them, in addition to the fact Peter is very wealthy and that they married after only dating for a short time, leads many people to assume Kay is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a>, though in actual fact she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWithThemForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWithThemForTheMoney">Not with Them for the Money</a> and genuinely loves Peter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>:<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Kay's father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent">Jonathan</a> began drinking a lot after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">his wife died</a>. This got him into trouble at work and resulted in him losing his job as the Carrington's landscaper...or at least, that's what Kay's grandmother assumed. Peter later reveals that Jonathan was actually fired because he turned down his stepmother's advances.</li><li> Grace Meredith Carrington had a drinking problem, which was a common source of tension between her and Peter. The night she died, she was openly drunk despite being over seven months pregnant, infuriating Peter, and she ended up falling into the pool and drowning while everyone else was asleep. Given how Grace had been trying to get sober and badly wanted her baby after suffering three miscarriages, Nicholas Greco theorizes that someone could've intentionally spiked her drink with booze to make her fall off the wagon, for nefarious purposes.</li></ul></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though never stated outright, Richard Walker shows signs of sociopathy; he's an impulsive risk-taker (including being a gambling addict and stealing valuable paintings right under his stepfather's nose), has a short temper, can appear highly charming, is very manipulative, and is willing to use violence to get what he wants with little remorse</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousInnocence">Ambiguous Innocence</a>: One possibility that's brought up is that Peter could've murdered Susan and potentially other people while sleepwalking, and therefore he wasn't fully in control of himself and wouldn't remember what happened. Even he admits it's a possibility and he appears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">distraught</a> at this prospect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out Peter didn't kill anyone, although he did interact with Susan's body while sleepwalking; he put his head on her chest to check for a heartbeat, causing him to get her blood on his shirt. He vaguely recalls this, but thought it was just a dream and so dismissed it</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Ambiguous Situation</a>: The first time Kay realizes Peter is a sleepwalker, she sees him kneeling beside the pool, moving his arm in the water. Kay isn't certain if he's trying to pull something out or push something in, and Peter doesn&#146;t remember. Kay convinces herself that he might have been dreaming about trying to save Grace, his first wife who drowned in the pool, but she can't be certain. The other possibility is far more sinister.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a>: Downplayed in the case of Peter's lawyers. They're willing to defend him even though they all privately believe he's likely guilty of the murder of Susan Althorp, but they're just doing their job and they're genuinely concerned about Kay's well-being.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">"Ass" in Ambassador</a>: Ambassador Charles Althorp is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">not a pleasant man</a>. He treats his servants contemptuously, cheated on and emotionally neglects his wife, cares more about his reputation than his family's wellbeing and was overly-controlling of his children, especially Susan. Greco even considers the possibility he was involved in Susan's disappearance in some way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out he hid the fact Susan had gotten addicted to drugs and instead of getting her proper help, he just cut her off financially to try and control it (which predictably didn't end well), as he didn't want it getting out that his 'perfect' daughter was an addict</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">Awful Wedded Life</a>:<ul><li> By all accounts, Peter and Grace's marriage wasn't the happiest. They weren't very compatible and fought a lot about Grace's drinking. It later turns out Grace was cheating on Peter and planned to divorce him after their child was born.</li><li> Downplayed between Gladys and Charles Althorp. There's no real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSparks">warmth or love</a> between them, and Gladys resented her husband for cheating on her and for the way he handled Susan's disappearance, but Gladys doesn't seem to care enough to feel bitter about it anymore; she's largely indifferent towards Charles, probably because she knows she's dying anyway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BailEqualsFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BailEqualsFreedom">Bail Equals Freedom</a>: Defied. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Peter</span> is eventually charged with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Susan's murder</span>, he's released on bail with strict conditions, including having to wear an ankle monitor and not being allowed to leave the property save for court dates and medical emergencies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When he inadvertently breaks the bail conditions while sleepwalking, he's swiftly jailed again</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a>: Grace's brother Phillip Meredith furiously and publicly accuses Peter of murdering Grace; soon after he hires Nicholas Greco to prove it. The only reason he didn't voice his suspicions earlier was to spare his parents's feelings, as they believed it was an accident; however, his father is now dead and his mother has Alzheimer's, so he feels he has to speak up for his sister.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>: The Carrington mansion is a magnificent old country house. It was originally built in Wales in the 17th century, before the whole thing was shipped over to the United States and rebuilt in New Jersey in the early 19th century.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire">Blackmail Backfire</a>:<ul><li> As a six year old, Kay overheard a woman blackmailing a man for money, and years later wonders if the woman was Susan Althorp and that was why she was murdered. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out it <em>was</em> Susan, blackmailing Richard Walker for drug money after she found out he was stealing paintings and replacing them with copies, and he indeed killed her to keep her quiet</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Alexandra Lloyd tries to blackmail Richard about the forgeries she made for him, prompting him to murder her as well</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse">Cartwright Curse</a>: Peter's college girlfriend Susan disappeared after he drove her home from a party at his family's estate; she eventually turns up dead. Then his wife Grace drowned in their pool. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a>, as a lot of people think he was responsible for their deaths. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His second wife Kay nearly ends up dead as well, at the hands of the same man who killed Susan and Grace, but is fortunately saved at the last minute</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a>: As it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kay was absolutely right all along that Peter wasn't a murderer, even though nearly every other character was convinced he was guilty</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>: A page torn out of a magazine was found in Grace's pocket after she drowned, containing a photograph and interview with her favorite actress. Both Kay and Greco are convinced it's significant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's revealed that what Grace was really interested in was the photograph of the actress; she was standing in front of a painting, of which there is a copy hanging in the Carrington mansion. When Kay realizes this, she comes to the same conclusion as Grace; the real painting was stolen from the Carringtons and replaced with a forgery</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Chekhov's Gunman</a>: Throughout the novel, Richard Walker keeps receiving and/or ignoring calls from an Alexandra Lloyd, whom his secretary believes is either an ex-lover or a bookie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's revealed near the ending that she's actually an artist, whom Richard hired to forge paintings he&#146;d stolen from the Carrington mansion, and is now trying to blackmail him</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">Children Are Innocent</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a>. As a six year old child, Kay overheard a woman blackmailing a man for money, the same day that Susan Althorp disappeared. She never mentioned it to anyone, both because she was afraid she'd get into trouble and because she didn't realize it was important. It never once occurred to her that Susan could&#146;ve been the woman until the present day events. Subsequently, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">feels guilty</a>, believing if she'd just told someone then perhaps Susan would've been found sooner <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and her father wouldn't have been murdered to cover it up</span>. Greco assures her she wasn't to blame, as she couldn't have understood its significance as a child.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearTheirName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearTheirName">Clear Their Name</a>: Kay spends most of the novel trying to find out what actually happened to Susan Althorp, among other connected events, in order to clear her husband's name. However, as time goes on, even she starts to have some nagging doubts about Peter's innocence, though she's determined to uncover the truth either way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer">Crusading Lawyer</a>: Prosecutors Barbara Krause and Tom Moran, who are hellbent on getting Peter Carrington convicted for Susan Althorp's murder; Krause in particular is incensed by the knowledge that the murderer of an eighteen year old girl has gotten away with it for twenty-two years, while her family are left to suffer without closure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>:<ul><li> Kay Lansing. Her mother died of an embolism mere weeks after she was born. Her father never really got over it and started drinking a lot, which allegedly resulted in him being fired as the Carrington's landscaper; two weeks later he took his own life and Kay was left to be raised by her grandmother.</li><li> Peter Carrington. He never had a close relationship with his father and his mother died when he was twelve. His girlfriend Susan disappeared and for years he was a suspect because he was the last person to see her. He and his wife Grace suffered three miscarriages and she had a drinking problem; then when she managed to carry a pregnancy almost to term, she drowned in their pool and the last time he saw her alive, he'd shouted at her for being drunk. And though it was ruled an accident, some people believe Peter killed Grace as well as Susan.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">Died in Your Arms Tonight</a>: Inverted; Kay's mother was holding her in bed and breast-feeding her when she had a fatal embolism; Kay's father returned home to find his dead wife lying in bed, still holding their daughter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>: Literally in Kay's case. When she was six years old, her dad vanished and the only trace that was found was his car, abandoned on a cliff beside the Hudson River. His body was never recovered and his disappearance was ruled a suicide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a>: It's strongly implied that Gary Barr is abusive towards his wife, Jane. He is subtly controlling of her and she appears to feel intimidated by him; at one point, he shouts at her and throws a sandwich at her face when she brings up her concerns about something. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's revealed in the epilogue that she has divorced him</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After being suspected of murder for over two decades and nearly going to prison for life, Peter is finally exonerated once and for all, Kay's love and faith in Peter is vindicated, the real murderer of Susan Althorp, Jonathan Lansing and Grace Meredith is caught, and Peter and Kay live happily ever after with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">their baby son</a></span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyOverheardConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyOverheardConversation">Easily Overheard Conversation</a>: A justified example. When she was six, Kay sneaked into the old chapel in the Carrington mansion her father had mentioned. She heard two people coming in and hid between the pews to avoid getting into trouble, and thus overheard a man and woman arguing about money.

His lawyers state that the jury will probably just see this as a new spin on the insanity defense and that it probably won't work; they tell Kay that while this defense is applicable in Canada, in the United States sleepwalking isn't a valid defense in a murder trial, and there are two people currently serving life sentences in the US for committing murder while sleepwalking.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInsomniac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInsomniac">The Insomniac</a>: Peter tells Kay he occasionally suffers from insomnia and so will go read in his library if he can't sleep.
