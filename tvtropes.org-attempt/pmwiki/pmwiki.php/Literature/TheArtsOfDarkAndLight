Beale, better known under his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName">Pen Name</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VoxDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VoxDay">Vox Day</a>. Though it has its origins in older short stories, the first book in the series proper, <em>A Throne of Bones</em>, was published in 2012. It has been followed, so far, by one sequel and a collection of related works. The prequel short story "Opera Vita Aeterna" was a finalist for the Hugo Awards in 2014.</p><p>Set in the medieval fantasy world of Selenoth, the series initially follows what appears to be two unconnected main plotlines. The first concerns political struggles in the Church and Senate of the decaying Amorran Republic, told mainly from the points of view of members of the feuding Valerian and Severan noble houses; the second chronicles intrigues in the rising rival power of Savondir, as seen mostly by a princess from an outlying kingdom. At the same time, ominous prophecies, seemingly supernatural irruptions and savage hordes on the march in the North suggest greater threats than mere local unrest. Only gradually do the true stakes of the emergent conflict become apparent.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>The Arts of Dark and Light</em> is unusual in modern fantasy for presenting a world in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch">The Church</a> is as much of a power as in the real medieval ages, temporally as well as spiritually. Thus, the actions of popes and prelates matter fully as much as those of dukes and kings, and even many villains do not wholly disregard the tenets of religion. At the same time, Selenoth is also a world where magic is very real, and Church theologians strain their intellectual resources trying to make sense of werewolves and immortal elves as part of the Lord's creation.</p><p>According to the author, the main storyline is ultimately projected to span five books. As of 2020, the series currently comprises the following volumes:</p><p></p><ul><li> Book I: <em>A Throne of Bones</em> (2012)</li><li> Book II: <em>A Sea of Skulls</em> (2017)</li><li> <em>Summa Elvetica: A Casuistry of the Elvish Controversy &amp; Other Stories</em> (2017), a collection of short fiction that ties into and expands the setting</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Finally, a necessary disclaimer: while we are well aware that Vox Day isn't popular with everyone (to put it mildly), this page is about the series, not the author's real-life politics. With this in mind, please consider the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">Rule of Cautious Editing Judgment</a> as you make your contributions.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><h2><em>The Arts of Dark and Light</em> contains examples of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Savondir</a>, at least in its newly annexed territories. They rule <em>only</em> through might and fear, and have to spend a lot of effort suppressing uprisings and purging dissidents. The King isn't extremely popular in Savondir proper, either, with Theuderic noting that more or less every noble of note would try to kill him and seize the throne for himself if he thought he could.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>: This is the core of the Wahrkonigen philosophy. Good and Evil are, ultimately, meaningless concepts with no natural existence, invented by human imagination. A truly objective observer does not judge, but simply recognizes that which Is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: Magnus, Corvus' older brother and Marcus' uncle, is the leader of House Valerius, as well as a decorated former officer and savvy politician, who acts as a mentor of sorts to his nephew and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foil</a> to his more narrowly military-minded brother.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>: Bereth is the fantasy equivalent, a skilled hawk rider in Elebrion's air force. Much of her plot arc concerns military actions when her country is invaded.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Generally averted, as most cultures in the setting are "realistically" medieval, at least on this matter. The major exception is the elvish kingdoms, which depend heavily on magic and allow female magic-users in their military. Individual examples include:<ul><li> Bereth, one of the elvish sorceresses and an officer in their air corps, who is quite deadly by any human standard.</li><li> Caitlys, too, though she's not professional military and so fights less, but is competent with weapons and magic when she does.</li><li> For a human example, Isabel, a designated slave for Savondir's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram">program to breed mages</a>. Savondir does not allow women to study magic, but her potential is strong enough to manifest spontaneously when she suffers a very acute trauma, and she uses it to wreak havoc on her tormentors.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirlfriend">Action Girlfriend</a>: Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend">Magical Girlfriend</a> for Marcus. Caitlys Shadowsong is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> from the elven kingdom, and is introduced more or less when she saves him from assassins trying to sabotage the diplomatic mission he is accompanying.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPolitician">Action Politician</a>: Corvus. Justified, since he is a general originally, and only becomes a politician when he is drafted for Consul by others without his direct knowledge. Even in office, though, he has good reason to be glad for his military and combat skills.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">Action Survivor</a>:<ul><li> Marcus. He's a theology student originally, and even after joining the military he's more of a staff officer than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">Frontline General</a>. He finds fighting for his life most disagreeable when he is forced to do it&mdash;though he also makes a creditable showing at it, at least so far.</li><li> Fjotra. She isn't a stereotypical fantasy warrior girl, but more of a "realistic" young Dark Ages noblewoman. Even so, she has some experience of violence, and makes it through a number of dangerous situations through wits and instinct.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>: Herwaldus. While the Church as such is not unconditionally pacifist (it includes Templar-like warrior priests among its holy orders, for example), the order of monks he belongs to is. He won't use violence against fellow creatures of the Lord, even to defend himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: The various human cultures have names derived roughly or entirely from real historical languages, and so will usually look fairly familiar to the reader (though some forms can still be rather exotic). At the same time, the fantasy civilizations follow their own more fantastic naming conventions, leading to this. Consider, for example, Marcus and Caitlys, an Amorran scholar and his elvish girlfriend.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Patrice and Blaise, the Savondir wizards who accompany the northern expedition. They come across more as friendly young academics than commissars, and are generally pretty nice to Fjotra when they interact&mdash;though they're also still pretty open about Savondir intending to annex her father's kingdom once the werewolf crisis has been dealt with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a>: Downplayed, but Fjotra finds herself somewhat attracted to the Red Prince due to his handsomeness and dark charisma, even though he is a villain and it's clear he intends to conquer and oppress her people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>: Marcus is a somewhat downplayed example. He isn't a pacifist by any means, as he eventually does become a military officer (as his father wants him to), but he remains a highly empathetic person, who forgives enemies, hates unnecessary violence and feels sorry for the poor, the slaves, and basically everyone who is oppressed in some way&mdash;even the savage goblins the legion he is deployed to is assigned to fight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>: Severa ends up in an arranged marriage to shore up the Severans' relations with another noble house as the civil war draws nigher. Specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Magnus' son Sextus</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: The orcs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAlwaysEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAlwaysEvil">Subverted</a> with the goblins, however: while the humans generally consider them, too, to be this, the POV chapters/stories from their side show that they are quite humanlike psychologically, and some are actually even morally upright people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a>: Roheis is generous and kind (if somewhat condescending) to Fjotra when she comes to Savondir in search of help for the Dalarns in their war, and is about the only one there who is. Even so, she obviously has her own agenda as well, and it's not immediately clear what it is, nor where Fjotra will ultimately fit into it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually revealed that she is allied to Saint-Aglie's conspiracy.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>: Selenoth mixes traits of several historical periods in its constructed world. Amorr's political system and social values are inspired mostly by the late Roman Republic, but its technology is closer to the High Middle Ages, with stirruped, heavily armored cavalry and artillery that is much more mobile and accurate than anything in real-life antiquity. Also, there is a powerful church similar to medieval ultramontanism. Savondir has similarly medieval technology, but its society is an uneasy mixture of feudalism and modern totalitarianism (this being enabled in part by magic). Their naval technology is also more advanced than other things might indicate, approaching that of the early Age of Sail (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">without cannons</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a>: There is at least one that is active both in Amorr and Savondir, attempting to manipulate both states for its own ends. Possibly, there are several, with different non-human powers working at cross purposes. This is not made entirely clear, since most of the information about the conspiracy's deeper workings so far comes from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">Unreliable Expositor</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEvil">Ancient Evil</a>: The Watchers, who are behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a>. They are immortal beings who predate human and even elvish civilization, and seek to secretly steer the mortal states in certain directions as part of a grand occult design.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome">Ancient Grome</a>: The Republic of Amorr is a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> to Ancient Rome (with somewhat more advanced, "medieval" technology), and also sports a number of Greek features, including some philosophers with Greek-sounding names, Greek titles for at least some of its Church hierarchy, and a general undercurrent of Hellenistic pagan mythology and philosophy in its culture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyeSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyeSpy">Animal Eye Spy</a>: The elves use this as part of their intelligence service.

Most of the heroic protagonists are noblemen of some kind, showing that this is not an absolute rule&mdash;but most <em>other</em> aristocratic characters are at best privileged and indifferent to their lessers, and a fair number <em>are</em> outright evil, ranging from corrupt magistrates to depraved villains.

At the same time, nefarious forces are sowing dissent within the Amorran alliance itself, leading to increasing strife. This is one major reason why Patronus wants to end the alliance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">and simply annex the allied states instead</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic">Ban on Magic</a>: In Amorr, where it is punished by death if practiced without special Papal dispensation.

(Which, of course, makes sense: if personal shielding is a magical "skill" that any military wizard can learn, it will naturally be a basic part of their training.) Sorcerous combat is usually described in terms of using counterspells to break down the enemy's wards before delivering firepower, with the shields flaring increasingly brightly through a spectrum of colors as they strain and fail.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis">Became Their Own Antithesis</a>: Several examples, including:<ul><li> One of the noblest of the heroic main characters has become a brutal tyrant by the end of the first book&mdash;regretting this every step of the way, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">nonetheless continuing down along it.</a></li><li> More positively, Bessarias. In the series proper, he is a wise old elvish sage of strong faith, while a prequel story somewhat surprisingly reveals that by contrast, in earlier days he was a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCleverByHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCleverByHalf">arrogant young intellectual</a> before he began to study serious philosophy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">Beauty Is Bad</a>: Most of the more significant villains (e.g., Patronus and most of his family, the Red Prince) and ambiguous characters (e.g., Roheis) tend to be varying degrees of handsome or beautiful, and almost invariably highly charismatic. By contrast, many heroes (such as Corvus) are rough-hewn or plain-looking, if not exactly ugly. There are also some exceptions to this trend; Caitlys is quite beautiful, for example, in her own exotic way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a>: A special variation.

If you think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>, well, you're probably right, but becoming evil to get away from it will probably only make everything <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even worse</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>: Trying to remain morally upright in times of trouble and war is not easy, and the series really rams home this point.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism">Witchkings</a> were particular masters of this dark art, and some of the monsters they created still linger as a villainous legacy even many centuries after their fall.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioweaponBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioweaponBeast">Bioweapon Beast</a>: The werewolves are the most (in)famous example, developed as a superweapon by the Witchkings when they were on the verge of utter defeat and had few resources left to wage conventional war. They work like typical werewolves in most respects, except that they have efficient social organization on a large scale (with armies numbering tens of thousands, ruled by a sort of priest-kings) and are hardwired with their late masters' commandment to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">destroy</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>: Due in part to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>. Amorr, probably the closest thing the setting has to a "Good Guy" faction, has social values largely appropriate to ancient or medieval times, so that (for example) slavery is commonly accepted there. However, their enemies are far worse, with Savondir a totalitarian monarchy that <em>combines</em> the worst features of medieval despotic feudalism and early modern French Revolution-style tyranny. And even they are better than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">pure destructiveness</a> of the Hordes in the North.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>: To the Church, <em>all</em> magic is Black Magic, demonic in origin and essence, and thus banned on pain of death.

Historically, the Witchkings particularly excelled at this: due to their ideology of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">seeking knowledge for its own sake</a>, they ignored all the traditional bans on the darker magical schools.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">Blasphemous Boast</a>: Elf king Mhael's speech to the Amorran embassy when they object to his magic ends on this note, disparaging the Church's equivalent of the Bible.

Officers and even soldiers in most countries wear fairly bright colors and distinctive insignia, as well as metal armor in the better-equipped forces. The exception is the elves: their full dress uniforms are as brightly colored as everyone else's, but in the field they usually wear darker greens and browns more akin to modern militaries. In their case, this is justified, since their mobility tactics benefit from camouflage, and they can use their superior training and magic to handle the command and control issues that were historically part of the reason for gaudy uniforms and standards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>: Tribune Fortex, Marcus' immediate superior in Legio XVII in <em>A Throne of Bones</em>.

Much like real Rome (or the US today), Amorr doesn't really have a titled nobility per se, but some bloodlines are still thought of as better than others.</li><li> Savondir does have a nobility, though even noblemen are subject to the monarchy's despotic authority. Theuderic is the son of a count, but had to renounce his title to enter Savondir's corps of sorcerers.</li><li> Fjotra is a princess, even if her rustic kingdom is not very respected by others (and seems destined to be annexed by Savondir in the near future).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning">Book Burning</a>: When the Witchkings/Wahrkonigen ruled, they did their best to burn all the histories of earlier times and create a Year Zero, and were successful enough for this to lead to present-day Amorr inhabiting a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect">Future Imperfect</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a>: Amorr has something very like the original Roman variant, including violent sports and gladiatorial games.

However, both are also fairly high-functioning ones, who can perform their roles as rulers and generals quite well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus">Canis Latinicus</a>: The author uses real Latin to represent Amorr's language, but also makes up a number of Latin-ish words to represent concepts unique to the Selenoth universe (or, sometimes, to add original flavor). Generally, these are fairly logically and thoughtfully constructed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">showing</a> that considerable work went into the imagined dialect, although there are some oddities. For example:<ul><li> Elves are called <em>aelvi</em> in Amorran, corresponding to the real Latin <em>alfi</em> (a loanword from the Germanic languages). The Amorran is clearly derived from a similar foreign root, but with a different history of transmission before it entered the language.</li><li> One of the top Amorran military ranks is <em>stragister militum</em>. <em>Stragister</em> is presumably an amalgamation and contraction of the separate Roman titles <em>strategus</em> (general) and <em>magister</em> (master, commander). The office of <em>magister militum</em> (literally "master of soldiers") was a senior military appointment in the late Roman Empire, and <em>stragister militum</em> appears to be the approximate Amorran equivalent.</li><li> The high Church officer equivalent to the <em>camerarius</em> (or <em>camerlengo</em> in modern Italian&mdash;roughly, steward or chamberlain) is called <em>cerulengus</em>, indicating that he is the keeper "of the Blue" (<em>caeruleus</em>) rather than "of the Chamber" (<em>camera</em>), blue being the color of the College of Cardinals in Amorr (as opposed to red in real life). The clearly non-native element <em>-engus</em>&mdash;or more likely, an assimilated <em>-lengus</em> (then an agent marker derived from the same Germanic root as English <em>-ling</em> or German <em>-lein</em>, with a Latinizing grammatical suffix <em>-us</em>, in either case replacing the ordinary Latin agent suffix <em>-arius</em> we would expect)&mdash;would further, as in the real-life Italian, indicate a Germanic influence on Amorran "Latin". Such makes sense in the context of the worldbuilding, since ancient Amorr was once conquered by the pseudo-Germanic Wahrkonigen and presumably absorbed some of their language.</li><li> <em>Decessus Immortuus</em>, the name of a mysterious painting, loosely translated in the text as <em>The Death of the Undying</em>. The first word is real Latin, but the second one is an original invention, seemingly derived from <em>mortuus</em> (dead person, corpse) with negative prefix <em>in-</em> (assimilated as <em>im-</em>)&mdash;effectively, a literal Latin version of <em>undead</em>. The grammar is also irregular, possibly deliberately so; in correct Latin, the second word would be in the genitive case here (<em>immortui</em>).</li><li> The titular Throne of Bones is called the <em>Sedes Ossus</em>, an original, irregular fantasy Latin construction. In real Latin, the word <em>sedes</em> is grammatically feminine, so it should be either <em>sedes ossea</em> for the adjective ("throne of [the material] <em>bone</em>"), or <em>sedes ossorum</em> for genitive plural ("throne of [many] <em>bones</em>").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>: The goblins are treated this way by everyone, almost as a joke, sort of like the stereotype of the Red Army in World War II that often surrendered in huge droves and could only ever win through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutscareTheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutscareTheEnemy">terrorizing</a> their own troops and drowning the enemy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">sheer numbers</a>. At one point, it's suggested that this is at least in part a self-reinforcing stereotype: since the goblin soldiers know that their commanders treat them as expendable, it makes good sense that their morale is low.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">Can't Argue with Elves</a>: The Selenoth elves are much wealthier, more knowledgeable, beautiful and magical than the setting's human cultures, as well as near-immortal. They also have a much more advanced society, with living standards approximating the modern world (thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic">Utility Magic</a>), civil and political rights and rule of law, secularism and even a fairly gender-egalitarian and sexually liberated culture. Due to this, it's probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> to at least some extent that they look down on the more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">"authentically medieval"</a> humans as barbaric, superstitious, unhygienic, misogynist, economically backward and generally unappealing. However, the author also makes very clear that their society has other social problems instead, which are serious enough, somewhat subverting the trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious">Captain Oblivious</a>: While Marcus isn't generally one when dealing with his fellow men, he often comes across this way in his interactions with the elves, mainly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">their society</a> and his own more "realistically" medieval one.

Interestingly, even the Witchkings (who come across as very stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>-type villains when described by everyone else) defy this when we see a POV from their side, insisting that <em>they</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsEvil">are really the good guys</a>. However, the King of Savondir is a more or less straight example: he believes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespotismJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespotismJustifiesTheMeans">power for its own sake</a> only, uses the most brutal and immoral methods to keep and expand his rule, and doesn't care what other people might think.

Among others:<ul><li> Corvus, who is the closest thing the first book has to a central protagonist. He starts out as an upright and popular general who idealistically stands for office in a time of crisis, and then gradually grows more disillusioned as one tragedy after another hits him.</li><li> The younger characters (Marcus, Fjotra) show more typical fantasy protagonist growth arcs, starting out in low positions and growing into their greater responsibilities while questioning previous authorities.</li><li> Severa is youthfully naive and impulsive, gets drawn into a conspiracy to spite her father, then has to grow up in a hurry and become more mature as the civil war strikes her family.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChatWithSatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChatWithSatan">A Chat with Satan</a>: Or with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a>, anyway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Specifically, Laris Sebastius, after revealing himself as a Watcher, offers Corvus power, glory and the salvation of his troubled Republic if he will do his bidding as puppet ruler of Amorr.

Marcus notices this when he visits Elebrion: a sublimely beautiful and very clean and well-maintained city, but inhabited by few, and with almost no children. The figure he comes to think of to describe it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia">"a city of dead angels"</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">Christmas Cake</a>: Played with where Roheis is concerned. She is a widow when she is introduced, but part of her description specifically brings up the curious fact that she still has not <em>remarried</em>... even though she is a beautiful woman who even now looks quite younger than her true age of 26 years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a>: The Amorran Church maintains both religious military orders and a more prosaic security force of church soldiers to protect its properties and interests, entirely separate from the Republic's secular chain of command.

Though he used to be a great general, and still is in many ways, he is both out of his depth in the Byzantine politics of the capital and an ever more obviously old and tired man, himself, who really would rather retire than battle over the Republic's future in the Senate. He also becomes increasingly much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> as the Republic slides ever closer to complete collapse in spite of his best efforts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Badass</a>:<ul><li> Quintus Tullius Acerus, the senior tribune of Legio VII in the prequel stories (whose rank is thus approximately that of colonel).

However, there really is no "common" language as such, with each of the setting's cultures speaking its own, mutually unintelligible from the others. (In the style of Tolkien, but more explicitly, the languages are based more or less closely on real-life ones, mostly derived from the Indo-European language family. For example, Amorran is a variant of Latin with more Germanic influences, the Savondir language a sort of archaic French or Norman, and the Dalarn tongue is derived from Scandinavian dialects. Elvish picks up at least some phonology and grammar from Celtic, though it also seems to incorporate other, non-Indo-European elements.) Of course, scholars, diplomats and others from cosmopolitan backgrounds are likely to know second and third languages in this sort of setting, so communication is still possible&mdash;just not as easy as in a typical fantasy setting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a>: The Watchers are undying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">incredibly ancient</a> cosmic monsters that cannot be destroyed by any known human agency, whether mundane, magical or relating to religious exorcism.

Much like the real-life medieval Roman Catholic Church, the one in Amorr is heavily involved in worldly politics, and so draws in its share of opportunists, power mongers and generally corrupt clergymen&mdash;and this has realistic effects both on how it works internally and how it is perceived by outsiders. However, there are also many honest priests who are sincerely devoted to their religion, and do their best to limit the sway of the hypocrites, the serving Pope being notable among them. On the whole, the Church is deeply flawed, but still ultimately presented as a net force of good in the world.

However, in their last days they became desperate enough to resort to it. Though the Witchkings were defeated before they could be fully developed and deployed, some wolves survived the elves' purges, and continued to grow and adapt in the remote wilderness.

However, according to most people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> (and probably most readers as well) the Witchkings really play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">Dark Is Evil</a> trope completely straight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a>: Dauragh, the last heir to the Witchkings, tries to rally the remnants of his ancestors' followers to reclaim their legacy, and uses methods generally appropriate for this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkTimes">The Dark Times</a>: The reign of the Witchkings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> a number of centuries ago, who created a Year Zero by burning all books written prior to their time and conquered almost the entire world before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a> of elves and men barely managed to defeat them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>: Theuderic, the Savondir operative who is a minor POV character in the main story, stars as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> in the prequel short story "A Magic Broken" (reprinted in the expanded <em>Summa Elvetica</em> collection).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>: Ar Mauragh, the last <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(or technically, second last)</span> of the Wahrkonigen.

And the villains can be extremely evil, and sometimes fairly alien.<ul><li> Almost everyone, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">The Republic</a> Amorr, accepts slavery as a matter of course. Even good characters do not generally question the institution as such&mdash;though they will (in varying degrees) resent it when people <em>mistreat</em> their slaves.</li><li> Just as in real medieval times, religion is a bigger part of life than in the present-day secular West. The Church has a powerful influence in politics, and this is widely seen as how it should be. Most characters are also more religious personally than the casual reader might expect, at least in Amorr. This is perhaps the setting's greatest difference from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> and other standard fantasy.</li><li> Savondir is pretty much treated as evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, but apart from their political totalitarianism, their social values are also old-fashioned in some ways. For example, people consider it very strange that Roheis has not yet remarried&mdash;even though she is of a good noble family and an intelligent and beautiful woman, who still looks quite a bit younger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">her 26 years</a>.</li><li> The orcs are written as straight-up sociopaths. They see other people as things, and treat them entirely in ways that are convenient to themselves. For example: obey superiors who can punish you if you don't; don't kill screaming children just because they're annoying if you might need them later; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">do</a></em> feel free to kill them if you won't. This for a smart orc who thinks ahead&mdash;the stupid ones have little impulse control, and so tend to act on whim without considering possible longer-term consequences when not kept under firm control.</li><li> Played with where the elves are concerned. Unlike most others, they actually have fairly modern and even liberal values for the most part, believing in gender equality, secularism, a fair amount of sexual freedom and such things. So they probably look like the least odd culture to the average reader&mdash;but given Vox Day's own strongly conservative politics, writing people from such a society sympathetically is certainly Deliberate Values Dissonance for <em>the author himself</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed">Democracy Is Flawed</a>: The Amorran Republic, though its Roman Republic-style democracy is not fully "democratic" in the modern sense of the word. The story shows the awkwardness of the system, as well as its potential for a fair bit of corruption&mdash;but at the same time, it also makes clear that naked tyranny is still far worse, and that for all its flaws, the Amorrans dearly prefer what they have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the alternative</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>: Demons in Selenoth are mostly incorporeal, and so lend themselves well to this.

For example, immaterial souls survive the death of the body, but wizards with the right magical equipment can analyze and even destroy them, too. This makes the supernatural world of the <em>divine</em> the great mystery of the setting, instead: no wizard-scientist, no matter how learned or wise, has so far been able to understand God.<ul><li> This is in keeping with understandings of the term "magic" in Europe circa 1000-1500. Generally speaking, scholars of that time distinguished "Demonic magic" from "Natural magic". "Demonic magic" came from, well, "demons." By contrast, Natural magic relied on the &#145;occult&#146; (from the Latin meaning &#147;hidden&#146;) properties of natural substances. These were properties which could not yet be explained by medieval scientific knowledge but were nonetheless believed to be part of the natural world and not reliant on demons to make them work: one classic example was the power of the magnet to attract iron.

This limits them in some ways (they obviously can't use it, even though magic is both quite common and quite powerful in the setting), but on the other hand, God seemingly supplies them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> to lessen the disadvantage. Whether the Amorrans are actually right is not made clear; while there's nothing <em>obviously</em> evil or corrupting about magic in itself (which is fairly "materialistic" in this setting), most people who use it do seem to be fairly morally ambiguous at best. Savondir aside, even the elves are not so much good as morally gray, and the Witchkings at least <em>were</em> originally corrupted by their thirst for magical knowledge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>: Most Elven military wizards are essentially this, being both officers with ordinary military skills and training (including close quarters combat) and skilled sorcerers.

In Selenoth, "magic" is for the most part repeatable and quantifiable, and thus treated more or less as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">"science"</a> as we understand it (with controlled experiments, formal hypotheses and theories and so on). By contrast, religion is a purely "supernatural" power, with priests able to work miracles (or not&mdash;as noted, this is less predictable and mechanical) solely through divine grace. Thus, the "Science" part of the conflict is really played by the wizards, while the "Magic" is performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">magic-hating</a> priests.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">The Magocracy</a>:<ul><li> The Witchkings, since their magic was a racial trait, carried by the overcaste of their empire. They also had lesser, baseline human wizards (who were not Witchkings proper, although sometimes mistaken for such by others) serving them as officers and officials.</li><li> Downplayed with Savondir. Their empire is a hereditary monarchy, but their magical corps (basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a>, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a>) is extremely powerful in their society, much like the Party in a more modern totalitarian state.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">Maligned Mixed Marriage</a>:<ul><li> Marcus' relationship with Caitlys suffers from this, as both the elves and the Amorrans are various degrees of hateful toward mixed unions, and on top of that, most Amorrans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">murderously</a> hate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic">sorceresses</a> like Caitlys. Marcus' reputation especially suffers for this&mdash;or at least that's how it seems, though this may be partly due to the plot and viewpoints focusing on Amorr rather than Elebrion.</li><li> Theuderic and Lithriel are a more downplayed example, since Savondir doesn't hate magic (and their official eugenicists don't seem to object very much to elvish blood, either). They suffer more what amounts to social prejudice, as opposed to the threat of lynch mobs. Possibly, Theuderic being a member of the powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> also has something to do with it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a>:<ul><li> Although he can't prove it, Silvertree believes that First King Thule (the founder of the Witchkings) had Watcher assistance in his magical experiments, and that some faction among the Fallen helped create the Witchking empire for their own purposes.</li><li> Demonstrably, rival Watcher factions are also behind most of the present-day conspiracies in Savondir and Amorr, and are implied to be the power behind the Horde as well in the second book.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Manipulative Bitch</a>: Roheis is an effective manipulator, who plays a major role in the anti-Crown conspiracy in Savondir.

Caitlys is not exactly unfeminine, but she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> from the elves' secular culture, while Marcus is a kind-hearted and devout scholar type without combat experience (when they first meet). She saves him from villains several times, including once when he tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">Save the Villain</a> and got backstabbed for it (whereas she wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">just kill the guy</a> all along).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: The Wahrkoenigen, the Witchkings' own name for themselves. The word is German-derived, and seems to mean "True Kings"&mdash;but there is a deeper meaning than that to it. As the books reveal, the Witchkings were devoted to a Nietzschean-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">philosophy of transcendence</a> that they identified with the Truth of all existence. So, their title really means <em>Kings of the Truth</em>. (Their transhumanist magic was similarly the <em>Wahrkunst</em>, or "Art of the Truth".)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">Medieval European Fantasy</a>: Played with, in that Amorr has a fair bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome">Ancient Grome</a> to it, but ultimately played more or less straight. Savondir is a late medieval/early Renaissance culture as far as aesthetics and technology go, and even Amorr has such things as cathedrals, High Middle Ages-style heavy cavalry and armor, and pants. The other human cultures are in roughly the same range (the Dalarns in the North are a little more primitive), while the elves are more of a typical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> culture (with more present-day social values and lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic">Utility Magic</a> that enables a fairly modern lifestyle, but still cloaked in medieval trappings).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>: Averted. Although it has suffered various apocalyptic wars and such over the millennia that have retarded its development, Selenoth <em>is</em> advancing. Savondir, especially, is actively researching both magic and science, and their technology, although generally medieval, is still noticeably more efficient than Amorr's. Theoretical science is very highly developed compared to real life medieval times, with pseudo-Darwinian evolutionary biology, scientific eugenics (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">in Savondir</a>) and atomic theory (assisted by magical experiments) that is closer to Rutherford and Bohr than Epicurus and Lucretius.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalUniversalLiteracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalUniversalLiteracy">Medieval Universal Literacy</a>: Downplayed. Literacy in Selenoth is fairly widespread, although still more limited than in the real-life present day. Books are somewhat rare and expensive, at least among the lower classes; Speer's peasant family is noted as somewhat unusual for owning seven volumes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeltingPotNomenclature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeltingPotNomenclature">Melting-Pot Nomenclature</a>: Both of the major human empires have several different influences in their naming conventions:<ul><li> Amorrans of the upper classes for the most part have traditionally Roman-sounding names on the <em>praenomen-nomen-cognomen</em> pattern (such as the main protagonist, Sextus Valerius Corvus). However, other citizens often have only a single name, and sometimes one of Greek, Semitic or even Germanic origin that has been only perfunctorily Latinized (e.g.: Herwaldus, Ecclesiastes, Habakkus). Presumably, this reflects class differences, as well as the international culture of the powerful Amorran Republic.</li><li> Similarly, Savondir mixes names of several origins, though here they are adjusted to fit French patterns rather than Roman. Unlike in Amorr, most names here seem to be Germanic originally (Arnaud, Gerard, POV mage Theuderic), and the rest usually Greek (Pierre, Philippe), with relatively few Latin-derived ones.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst">The Men First</a>: The elves care a lot more about their soldiers than the human powers and make every effort to minimize casualties if at all possible, whether it's by using cautious tactics or equipping them with expensive magical gear. In general, they also have the best supply services, medical establishment and such, with their government really investing in them. Apart from purely humanitarian concerns, this makes sense for a number of pragmatic reasons: their living standards (and similarly, expectations) are higher, with casualties thus more expensive politically; they are almost immortal if <em>not</em> killed in battle, so dying is a comparatively worse fate than for a human; and not least, they are a rich but small power in steady demographic decline, with their already limited manpower their most precious resource, and so just can't afford the losses the larger empires can easily weather.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>: Ar Dauragh regretfully kills his companion (with her full assent and cooperation) when the Witchkings are going down in defeat and the elves are storming their fortress-laboratory, so that she won't be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">captured and tortured to death</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">beyond</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMage">Military Mage</a>: Most factions have some sort of these, though Elebrion is particularly magic-heavy (elves being an innately magical race).

All elves do have souls, according to the Church, and it is forbidden for Amorrans to enslave them (though people in other states sometimes do this).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent">Our Mages Are Different</a>: There are at least two different sorts of magic in Selenoth:<ul><li> General magical aptitude is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">a genetic trait</a> in this setting, and unequally distributed between different peoples and races (elves are much more magical than most humans, for example). This sort of magic draws on supernatural energies, which the user manipulates through his will to produce a variety of possible effects. Very powerful latent mages can sometimes spontaneously manifest some of these abilities, but in general, training is required for any sort of useful magic to be performed.</li><li> There is also a more arcane, "academic" magic that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormulaicMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormulaicMagic">relies on invocations</a>, forcing demons and other spirit-powers to work the wizard's will. This one seems to require only the knowledge of the proper formulae, as opposed to any inherently supernatural talent. Historically, the Witchkings used this type to upgrade themselves to the first one, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator">absorbing demonic materials into themselves.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Our Orcs Are Different</a>: Orcs in Selenoth are relatively humanlike but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, in the sense that they are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">a race of sociopaths</a> by human standards. They are also less intelligent than men, as a rule, though exceptional ones can be quite cunning. In any case, they are capable of cooperating, even holding fairly large societies together, though their politics are unstable and based on rather brutal dominance hierarchies. Orcs (and goblins, a closely related race) are soulless, or at least considered such by the Church, and may be killed or enslaved at will by faithful Amorrans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerebeastsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerebeastsAreDifferent">Our Werebeasts Are Different</a>: In addition to the werewolves, Selenoth also has the more enigmatic werecats. Unlike the former, they don't seem to have been created by the Witchkings, though other evil agencies are hinted to have been involved. Their society is much like that of a more intelligent sort of lion (or perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimalsAreDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimalsAreDogs">lions crossed with wolves</a>), though the more powerful among them can also assume human form.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Our Werewolves Are Different</a>: Selenoth's werewolves were created by the Wahrkonigen through demonic sorcery. The idea appears to have been to use them as soldiers, but they ran wild instead after their masters perished, eventually becoming a problem in their own right. As werewolves go, they are fairly typical in their abilities, occurring either in wolf, human or wolfman form, with some also able to shift between them. Some have additional magical powers, but most are "merely" ferocious fighters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions</a>: The Witchkings, who are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>. Generally, their philosophy is a mixture of amoral scientific positivism and Nietzschean transcendance, which in practice ends up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a>. During their reign, they tried to destroy the Church completely, though this ultimately failed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideGenreFoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideGenreFoe">Outside-Genre Foe</a>: The Watchers. The revelation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">ancient alien horrors</a> are behind Selenoth's troubles really shakes up what had hitherto been a fairly low-key fantasy political thriller, and even powerful wizards in the setting aren't much use against their bizarre abilities.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlordJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlordJr">Overlord Jr.</a>: The Red Prince is basically a younger, handsomer and (perhaps) smarter version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">his father</a>. His younger brother Duke Etienne tries to present himself the same way, but is more of a regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a>: Theuderic is quite a powerful wizard by human standards, and can be terrifying indeed for lower-level enemies to meet. He still cannot match powerful elven sorcerers of Silvertree's caliber, and far less someone like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Bessarias</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> from a Watcher, he is completely unable to defend himself.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">The Paladin</a>: The knights of the Order of St. Michael, who are warrior priests with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> and the Church's main defense against the occult powers of the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Path of Inspiration</a>: The forbidden witch cult in Amorr, that worships the Triune Goddess. It seems like rather standard neo-paganism, but at least some of its members turn out to have real occult powers. Severa joins the witches in secret defiance of her father when he mistreats her servant girl and has her lover killed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch">The Patriarch</a>:<ul><li> Severus Patronus has his family well in hand, and governs it in a manner that might be described as (very) harsh, but fair. His children may be headstrong, but he is used to handling much worse opposition in the Senate.</li><li> The protagonist Corvus dutifully <em>tries</em> to live up to Amorr's patriarchal ideals, but ultimately comes across as rather softer than his rival. His children are somewhat less unruly, though, so he doesn't really need to be quite as hard on them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleOfHairColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleOfHairColor">People of Hair Color</a>: Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite">Humans Are White</a> in Selenoth, there is noticeable ethnic diversity between the different nations, from the mostly Mediterranean Amorrans to the blond, blue-eyed Dalarns in the Wolf Islands, with expansionist Savondir a mixed region in between. At the same time, while some racial types are clearly predominant in some regions, the boundaries aren't clear-cut, and there is a range of traits across the whole continent&mdash;for example, even in Amorr proper there are some blonds and redheads, though they are much less common there than in the northern lands.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">People's Republic of Tyranny</a>: Malkan. It simply calls itself a Republic (without "People's"), but qualifies in every other way due to corrupt oligarchical politics, huge class differences, slavery and oppression. Basically, it's a fantasy version of the stereotype of medieval Venice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a>:<ul><li> The Witchkings were capable of burning whole cities or tearing down mountains with their magic. In the prequel/flashback story, we see one example of this onscreen: one Witchking's single-word spell suffices to conjure enough white-hot supernatural fire to destroy a great fortress in seconds, down to the very stones&mdash;which is basically nuclear-level firepower in real life terms.</li><li> A few of the greatest sorcerers among the elves are also capable of similar feats. In the present day, this would specifically include Bessarias and Amitlya.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>: Patronus sort-of gets one when he explains to Severa why he was brusque to her earlier about Clusius, and manages to show that he actually had good reasons to be angry. Considering that no mention is made of freeing Verapora, though, it's still a downplayed one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">Pimped-Out Dress</a>:<ul><li> Elvish fashion makes great use of these. The descriptions in <em>Summa Elvetica</em> make their evening dresses sound like something halfway in between the high Baroque and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>.</li><li> Elaborate dresses are also part of Savondir court fashion, in contrast to the conservatism of Amorr. When Fjotra has to wear them during her stay there, she finds them both embarrassing and yet oddly attractive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist">Pinball Protagonist</a>: Fjotra remains mostly subordinate and without agency through most of her storyline in the first book, following the leads of either her relatives or Roheis (though exceptionally, she does rather proactively interrupt an assassination attempt at one point). The culmination of her character arc is her deciding to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turn against her mentor Roheis, now revealed as dubious at best, and make her own decisions, thus overcoming this trope</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlacebotinumEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlacebotinumEffect">Placebotinum Effect</a>: There is some doubt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> on whether female elves <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower">need to be maidens</a> to work magic, or if it's only the psychological effect of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a> that makes them <em>think</em> they lose it. Theuderic speculates that it's really the latter, since he can't see why the two things should be connected, as indeed they demonstrably aren't in humans. If this is correct, there might be hope for Lithriel that she could be cured one day, and her magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealTheCutie">returned to her</a>. On the other hand, Theuderic is a materialist, and there may well be a spiritual dimension to magic that he and the other Savondir state wizards are missing&mdash;after all, they explicitly can't understand how much of elven magic works where other, more tangible things are concerned, either.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoirotSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoirotSpeak">Poirot Speak</a>: Savondir characters usually include a few words of their vaguely French language (and the occasional unnatural-sounding phrase that seems to incorporate some French grammar) when speaking Amorran. Likewise, Fjotra's Savondir French is somewhat broken early in the book, but gets better as she immerses herself in it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyActivePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyActivePrincess">Politically Active Princess</a>: The Dalarn princess Fjotra tries to be this, but comes from a small kingdom and doesn't really understand how politics and high society work in a Byzantine empire like Savondir. A big part of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> is to learn this, so she can to be one of these more effectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Politically Incorrect Villain</a>: Duke Etienne holds very chauvinistic views about Savondir's neighbors, and perhaps the Dalarns in particular. He is also implied to be a rapist, and doesn't seem to mind marrying Fjotra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">against her will</a>. More generally, Savondir's leaders tend to come across this way overall, due to their Darwinian ideology and contempt for all "lesser" beings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">Power Glows</a>: Wizards often bleed off some light when they manipulate magical energies in the setting. Also, adding a supernatural touch to the Church, its senior clerics can occasionally manifest similar effects through their holiness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a>: The Church believes very clearly in one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>, but the elves play this more or less straight in their theology. As they see it, there is a multitude of gods, angels and spirits, some perhaps more powerful than others, but all part of the same continuum; and whom you invoke, if you feel like it, or by what name, probably doesn't really matter all that much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain">Predecessor Villain</a>: The Witchkings, in the sequence of the main story, being the last great threat that upset the peace everywhere and nearly destroyed the world. Some of their villainous legacies also still linger behind, such as the werewolves. They are also in the short story collection, which is mostly set earlier in Selenoth's history.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharmless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharmless">Prince Charmless</a>: Duke Etienne, who becomes the crown prince of Savondir after his older brother's convenient death. He is as sociopathic as the rest of his family, but takes after his father in lacking his brother's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert">charisma</a>, and is nothing but creepy when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">tries to force Fjotra to marry him</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain">Protagonist Journey to Villain</a>: Corvus. In a very real sense, the first book is his tragedy as well as that of Amorr, and his personal trajectory parallels that of his state fairly closely. Sextus Valerius Corvus starts out as one of Amorr's most respected and beloved generals, a solid traditional man and a firm opponent of political corruption and the Severans' ruthless policy of annexation. However, he is persuaded to stand for office and become a unifying force for the country as the political process degenerates&mdash;which fails spectacularly. In increasing desperation to save his beloved Republic, the tormented Corvus takes after more and more of his enemies' cutthroat methods, to the point that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">makes himself military dictator and has many tens of thousands of people killed or exiled to secure his rule, after the civil war openly breaks out</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicStrangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicStrangle">Psychic Strangle</a>: King Mhael does this to a werewolf, showing the Amorrans that the elves can be not only cultured, but also dangerous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a>: Theuderic works for Savondir's royal wizards as a mid-level operative, and is more or less unreflectingly loyal to his seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> totalitarian empire out of a mixture of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">The Purge</a>: Savondir has recently had one, following an attempted coup, resulting in a reshuffling of much of the civil service and higher nobility.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsTheNewBlack">Purple Is the New Black</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example for a non-visual medium. Specifically, black magic effects are said to glow with a weird, dark purplish light.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">Purple Prose</a>: The author indulges in this occasionally, especially through the use of elaborate similes.

Though they managed to destroy them eventually, they lost three of their seven kingdoms as well as much of their manpower in the remaining ones, and suffered a crippling postwar demoralization and depression not unlike Britain after the World Wars in real life. They never really recovered, and no elven kingdom has been among the major world powers since, seeing their former position eclipsed by Amorr and (somewhat later) Savondir.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>: Corvus. While Amorran generals will usually hold florid speeches to inspire the troops, he keeps his very succinct. For example:<div class="indent"><strong>Corvus:</strong> You can see that they're over there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreasskickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreasskickingOneLiner">Go kill them.</a></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">The Quisling</a>: Any of the puppet noblemen Savondir sets up to administrate its annexed territories.

Sometimes it is worn loose, though more often arranged in fantastic coiffures, at least for festive occasions. Those with work requiring any mobility naturally tend to braid or otherwise fasten it up in everyday life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">Rated M for Manly</a>: A series about politics, intrigue and warfare in an epic fantasy world, with protagonists ranging from grizzled generals and stern priests to aspiring young officers and secret agent wizards (along with an occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyActivePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyActivePrincess">Politically Active Princess</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> sorceress). In a medieval society, defending culture and civilization from the long night is a manly task, and he who cannot carry it out will have to learn, or else be found wanting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>: Though the series strongly resists the genre deconstruction of recent grimdark fantasy, it does address some implications of fantasy conventions that not all authors think about (or if they do, care about). For example:<ul><li> Unlike what is sometimes the case in fantasy, flying can be really uncomfortable if one is not dressed for it. Elven hawk riders wear heavy clothing for much the same reason as the Red Baron and his contemporaries did in real life, and Marcus finds it a chilling experience to be carried by one in his streetwear.</li><li> Trying to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a> in real life often tends to bite back much harder than it usually does in fiction, and the same is true in Selenoth.

The Latin-like Amorran language and nomenclature is particularly interesting, with Greek, Germanic and even Semitic elements incorporated in a way that suggests a long period of organic growth and borrowing from neighboring tongues.

The elves are the main exception: their society <em>is</em> fairly equal in a "modern" way, about Level 5, even allowing women in the military&mdash;although this causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerVersusMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerVersusMan">other problems</a> instead.

The elves, meanwhile, fear that they will be drawn into any "hot" war between the two great human empires sooner or later, and so work quietly to keep the peace.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFictionLGBT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFictionLGBT">Speculative Fiction LGBT</a>: Although Amorr is intensely hostile to homosexuality (in fact, just like in many real medieval societies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">it's punished by death</a>), the magic of the setting also enables LGBTQAP+ characters in some ways. The main example is Scaum-Durna, a male demon who uses an assumed female form to sleep with men.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualAntithesis">Spiritual Antithesis</a>: To <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, and what the author perceived as its nihilistic message. The first book especially uses quite a few of the basic plot points of <em>A Game of Thrones</em> for its own story&mdash;only to then take them in a completely different direction. For a few major examples:<ul><li> The big defining point of <em>A Game of Thrones</em> is, of course, that Ned Stark fails and dies specifically <em>because</em> of his stubborn uprightness, following the series' general tendency toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</a>. <em>A Throne of Bones</em>, which puts a similar character (Corvus) in a similar situation (poised to strike first against his enemies), instead has him give in to the temptation to break his values <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">for the greater good</a>, and apparently succeed&mdash;only to then go on to show that this really made everything much <em>worse</em> (for both him and everyone else) than playing by the rules would have.</li><li> In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, the Church and religion in general are almost always a force of evil, whether presented as the sinister sorceries of Melisandre or the fanaticism of the Sparrow. In <em>The Arts of Dark and Light</em>, the Church, although realistically corrupt for such an institution, nonetheless is (on the whole) a major force for good in the world, complete with a canny but on the whole rather saintly Pope, and serves as a powerful restraint on the ruthless ambitions of the worldly politicians and nobles.</li><li> <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> presents dragons, the most fantastic of fantasy creatures, as dumb animals and almost solely as a tool for human use, a military weapon or&mdash;basically&mdash;glorified flying warhorses. When dragons appear in <em>A Throne of Bones</em>, they are splendid, fierce and formidable beasts, almost forces of nature, and Savondir's proud archmages fail utterly and ignominiously when, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrideBeforeAFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrideBeforeAFall">trusting in their own wisdom</a>, they try to harness them for such a subservient role.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">Starcrossed Lovers</a>: Marcus and Caitlys, since both Elebrion and Amorr usually look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">very unkindly</a> upon human-elf relationships. Amorr's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic">Ban on Magic</a> doesn't make people there more accepting of the sorceress Caitlys, either. And of course, given their very different backgrounds, they also both have various personal prejudices that they must somehow overcome if they want to be together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>: In Savondir, there are more than a few hints that the Red Prince has this attitude toward his father the King, possibly aiming at it by working together with Roheis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, with the real conspirator being Count Saint-Aglie.</span> His younger brother Duke Etienne in turn behaves this way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">against him</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a>:<ul><li> Savondir's corps of mages effectively function as one, regulating everything related to magic in their country (which is quite a bit, in a high fantasy setting) as well as supplying military mages and secret police. They are entirely separated from the usual feudal hierarchies, nominally slaves to the crown answerable only to the king, much like the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries">janissaries<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the Ottoman Caliphate. Also like the Janissaries, they are in reality a very powerful state within the state.</li><li> Amorr's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> plays a role approximating this in the Republic, with the Church having immense political influence and control over vast properties, as well as its own military forces, network of intelligence agents and the special federal police enforcing the state's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">anti-magic policy</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a>: All the human cultures in the setting embrace this, following the example of the real medieval age the setting is based upon. Women do not fight as soldiers, nor are they trained in magic in Savondir (in Amorr, of course, magic is banned for everyone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">period</a>). Averted by the elven kingdoms, however, who allow female elves both in their magical colleges and their military. One of their military sorceresses becomes a POV character in the second book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker">Stepford Snarker</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Lithriel</a> tries to shrug off her horrible experiences by appearing irreverent and jaded, but is actually deeply unhappy with what has happened to her life. She is quite good at pretending otherwise, and can fool most people, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness">Fjotra</a> sees through her act right away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">The Strategist</a>: Corvus has become a successful general because he realizes that proper planning, intelligence and deployment are the keys to winning a campaign, and is good at the same. He isn't useless or a coward in a more direct fight, but his true talent is in directing larger wars. Corvus also thinks this is true of Marcus as an officer: though he will never be the greatest warrior in single combat, he is already an excellent tactician, and appears to have the potential to be a great strategist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics">Strategy Versus Tactics</a>: The story illustrates this by comparing Corvus and Saturnius, his second in command. While Corvus has the grand vision to plan and administer a successful campaign, Saturnius is a master of battlefield leadership, expert at exploiting tactical opportunities and inspiring the men. Neither of the men is exactly terrible in the opposite role, either, but each is far better at his own specialty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a>: Severa, sort of, after she comes to resent Amorr's patriarchal culture when her father treats her and her servant girl extremely harshly (by modern standards). This makes her join an underground cult of witches who oppose the Church and worship a female deity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">which is treated as clearly evil</a>. She is a somewhat downplayed example, though, since she isn't really very evil personally&mdash;and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">present-day standards</a>, at least, she also sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">has a point</a> when she complains about how women are treated in most of Selenoth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">Straw Misogynist</a>: Savondir, due to its degrading enslavement of all potential female magic users. This is probably the one way the Savondir mages are actually <em>worse</em> than the Witchkings (who were at least nice to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">their own female-presenting members</a>, even if they were jerks to everyone <em>else</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">Sufficiently Analyzed Magic</a>: Magic in Selenoth is more or less consistent and rule-bound, and so can be investigated scientifically. This is done by all the major magic-using factions, who can also use magical instruments to aid their research into more ordinary science. For example, atomic theory is quite advanced thanks to magical equivalents of cyclotrons and the like.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram">Super Breeding Program</a>: The monarchy in Savondir has a coercive one. All women with magical ability are impressed into it, with whatever degree of force necessary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Super Registration Act</a>: Savondir's royal wizards force all magic-users (potential or actual) to be part of their corps from an early age, stripping them of all family and other ties to serve only the state (and in particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">their own organization within it</a>). Notably, this applies to men&mdash;women are also conscripted, but used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">only as breeding stock</a>, and specifically not taught any magic, as that would make them more difficult to control.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">Sympathetic P.O.V.</a>: The Severans. In their POV chapters, they come across as much more reasonable and sympathetic (if still not exactly "good") than when seen from a Valerian viewpoint: Patronus at least has reasons and arguments for why he does his evil things, his sons follow him out of loyalty and because they think he's right, and Severa is basically an innocent child trying to be a grown-up and face her family's dangerous enemies with courage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> by Theuderic's POV chapters, however&mdash;both he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Savondir in general</a> still fairly consistently come across as horrible there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticSlaveOwner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticSlaveOwner">Sympathetic Slave Owner</a>: Marcus. Like all Amorran noblemen, he owns slaves, but treats his well and even with respect. Since Marcus is the introspective scholar type, he still feels somewhat uncomfortable with slavery as such, even though it's completely normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">in his society</a>&mdash;especially when he is exposed firsthand to how less privileged slaves than his can be treated by less kind masters. Like some medieval theologians in real life, he reasons that this institution, although an evil one, is probably an unavoidable result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Man's fallen nature</a> on this sinful earth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>: When Marcus (now an officer) has trouble with local irregulars and the Amorran SOP <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">calls for executing hostages</a> to force their compliance, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">doesn't want to do this</a>, and tries to figure out a way not to have to do it. In the end, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">compromises by having a few apprehended spies beheaded instead, who would have been sentenced and executed for their crimes anyway&mdash;thus technically going by the book while still sparing the innocent hostages</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>: Savondir appears to aspire to this, and puts it into practice by conquering new lands more or less continuously from among its neighbors. Sometimes using legal fictions and trumped-up justifications, but other times by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">right of conquest</a> alone. Before them, there were the Witchkings, who nearly succeeded at accomplishing this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingOverHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingOverHeaven">Taking Over Heaven</a>: The transhumanist Wahrkonigen had this as one of their ultimate objectives: not just to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">make men into gods</a>, but to storm the heavens and conquer the spiritual realms as well as the earth. However, they were stopped before they could actually do this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalentedPrincessRegularGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalentedPrincessRegularGuy">Talented Princess, Regular Guy</a>: Caitlys and Marcus.

The system is not entirely explained, but generally speaking, mages from different factions produce different colors&mdash;fire summoned by goblin shamans tends to be greenish or "dirty" dark red, for example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologicalPacifist">Technological Pacifist</a>: Or Magical Pacifist, since magic plays an anologous role to science and technology in Selenoth.

The Amorran Republic is a theocracy in theory, ruled directly by God&mdash;and in His absence, their equivalent of the Pope is the acting head of state as a sort of divine viceroy. However, he is more of a constitutional monarch or European-style president than an absolute sovereign: there is an elaborate system of checks and balances which ensures that in practice, most temporal power is really held by the elected Consuls and the Senate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a>: Caitlys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">doesn't take it well</a> when a villain tries to use Marcus as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a>, and more or less literally tears him to pieces with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMissileStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMissileStorm">Magic Missile Storm</a>-type spell.

All the more so since they use this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">infiltrate the Raknarborg and assassinate the allied commanders</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYearReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYearReign">Thousand-Year Reign</a>: The Amorran Republic in its modern form has lasted for some four hundred years. In his rhetoric, Patronus claims that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient">his reforms</a> are implemented, the new, stronger Amorr will last at least another four hundred and surpass the glory of the first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroneMadeOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroneMadeOfX">Throne Made of X</a>: The titular Throne of Bones.

They are effectively immortal, have extremely powerful magic and are revealed to be running an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> that seems to be steering both Amorr and Savondir into conflict.</li><li> Some of the older elves approach this. King Mhael's grandfather is said to have ruled seven kingdoms when the races of men were still naked bands of hunters in the woods, which would be at least many thousands of years in the past.

And if he has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">destroy the Republic to save it</a>, then so be it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a>: Corvus. He starts out as an upright man with faith in the Republic's institutions, but becomes disillusioned with the political corruption he sees after returning from the military. Joining a group of conservative senators fighting against Patronus and his expansionism, he witnesses Amorr's national polity unravelling around him, and becomes ever more desperate in his attempts to save his country. Eventually, he sacrifices his honor and conscience&mdash;and still fails to stave off the civil war, which he then has to fight out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis">the tyrannical dictator</a> of the very Republic he was trying to preserve.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake">Tragic Mistake</a>:<ul><li> The execution of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tribune Fortex</span>.

However, the elves have lots of magic, and use it for even quite trivial things, much as present-day humans use electricity for household appliances. (They also have industrial applications for it, such as alchemically altering the flavor and alcohol content of beverages.) The Witchkings also made use of this when they were around, being the most magic-heavy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia">utopian</a> faction in the setting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>: Patronus thinks it will be worth sacrificing Amorr's republican freedoms to secure its power.

"The Wardog's Coin" especially emphasizes this, but there is no shortage of examples in the main sequence.

In contrast, however, elves are apparently seen as especially holy (despite being magic-users and atheists who by and large hate the Amorran church), and get special treatment.

The way the goblins are portrayed as savages tends to enhance this. However, a later POV segment shows the life of one of those very goblins, and that it has a fairly humanlike intellect. It behaves like a savage because it has had its loved ones killed, been pressganged, tortured, and then captured and enslaved by the Amorrans, until it went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">a little crazy</a> from the trauma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatNowEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatNowEnding">"What Now?"

At the same time, however, the books go out of their way to show that even in the most evil states, most people are not monsters, but simply trying to get on with their lives as best they can&mdash;and that moreover, there are also many true idealists working hard to make their dark world a better place. Sometimes they can even succeed, in great things or small, perhaps by staving off a war or even saving just one innocent life.
