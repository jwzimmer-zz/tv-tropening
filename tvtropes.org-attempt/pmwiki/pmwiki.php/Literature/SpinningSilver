Free to lend and reluctant to collect, he has left his family on the edge of poverty - until Miryem intercedes. Hardening her heart, she sets out to retrieve what is owed, and soon gains a reputation for being able to turn silver into gold.</p><p>One night Miryem boasts of this near the woods, and this draws the attention from none other than the King of the Staryk, a race of ice demons who kill any who hunt their pure white animals, plunder gold from the people, and freeze any and all who wander too close to the woods. He gives Miryem a challenge: three times over, turn his silver into gold. If she fails, her life is forfeit. If she succeeds, she shall become his queen. It's a seemingly impossible task, and one that alerts her to the true scope of his plans for his world and hers.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>While Miryem struggles to earn the gold she needs to avoid the Staryk's wrath, her neighbor, Wanda, fights to find a way to deal with her violent, drunken father and his clear intent to marry her off for a bride price.

Miryem finds it easier to fear that because it's so real and ubiquitous, rather than the inhuman and storied Staryk.</li><li> Early on in her marriage/captivity, Miryem barters her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">marriage rights</a> away to the Staryk king in exchange for answers to questions in order to keep him from <em>acting</em> on those rights (namely consummating their marriage).

So she accused the moneylender of being in league with the Devil in order to keep her jewels and dower herself to a blacksmith as a father for her child. (By the events of the rest of the story, and the townspeople making a point to tell it to her and laugh, the implication is that the real "Rumpelstiltzkin" was Jewish like her family.)
