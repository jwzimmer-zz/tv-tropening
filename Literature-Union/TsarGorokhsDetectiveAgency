Like all his other works, the series is full of deliberate anachronisms, magic, and humor. The protagonist of the series, Mladshiy Leytenant (Third Lieutenant) Nikita Ivashov, is a modern-day Russian fresh-out-of-the-academy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpellOurNameWithAPo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpellOurNameWithAPo">policeman</a>. One day, during field training in an abandoned village, he enters a hut's basement, which someone immediately shuts on him. After getting out, he finds himself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Medieval Russian city called Lukoshkino</a> ruled by the strict but just Tsar Gorokh. After explaining who he is to the Tsar, Nikita is asked to head the first Russian detective agency using modern investigative techniques (technically, the wording used for the agency better translates as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>, but Nikita's job description is exactly what you would expect a police detective to do). Setting up his office in the home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabaYaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabaYaga">Baba Yaga</a>, whom he recruits as an expert on forensics and all things magical (thanks to her criminal past), he is also given a simple-minded village boy named Dmitriy "Mitka" Lobov, as a "junior associate". Being a clear example of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong">Mother Russia Makes You Strong</a> (apparently, he bends horseshoes with his bare hands for fun), Mitka frequently creates more problems than he solves. In later books, he is also given a company of Tsar's streltsy (guards) under Sotnik (commander of 100) Foma Yeremeyev to add manpower to the agency.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In a typical fashion, seemingly small cases usually unravel into huge conspiracies, frequently leading back to a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">Koschei the Deathless</a>. In fact, it's usually a surprise when a conspiracy <em>doesn't</em> lead back to him.</p><p>The initially strict Tsar quickly mellows out to Nikita and considers him a good friend, although, when necessary, he reminds the detective who the autocrat is. However, the boyars (noble advisors) consider Nikita to be an upstart, especially since he doesn't recognize their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">Blue Blood</a> and occasionally treats them as much suspects as any peasant. Another enemy of Nikita in Lukoshkino is Deacon Filimon Gruzdev, a low-ranking member of the church who also serves as the Tsar's scribe (being one of the few who can read and write).</p><p>The series consists of 10 novels and is the author's longest running series:</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ol><li> <em>Tsar Gorokh's Detective Agency</em> (1999)</li><li> <em>The Plot of the Black Mass</em> (1999)</li><li> <em>The Flying Ship</em> (2000)</li><li> <em>Bride Elimination</em> (2002)</li><li> <em>The Case of the Sober Buffoons</em> (2004)</li><li> <em>Detectives on Vacation</em> (2006)</li><li> <em>To Marry and Neutralize</em> (2009)</li><li> <em>Tsar Gorokh's Rusty Sword</em> (2014)</li><li> <em>Tsar Koschei's Black Sword</em> (2015)</li><li> <em>The Dead Must Be Taken Alive</em> (2017)</li></ol><p></p><hr><h2> The books contain examples of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">All Psychology Is Freudian</a>: After Mitka learns to read, he borrows a psychology book from the Austrian tsarina, has the German ambassador translate it, and begins to style himself an expert on psychology. Naturally, his attempts at psychoanalyzing random people frequently result in him getting pummeled for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingMeALogarithm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingMeALogarithm">using long words on people</a>. And yes, he will often try to ask about parental relationships, even though the events in the books supposedly predate Freud by many centuries.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>: The series doesn't appear to try to stick to any historical time period, instead going for a generic "Medieval Russia" feel with some magic thrown in for good measure. The first novel has various birds show up in Baba Yaga's yard when she summons them. When Nikita is listing the birds, turkeys are mentioned to be among them. Turkeys are native to North America and wouldn't be imported to Russia until centuries later. On the other hand, Nikita does at one point mention the 16th century, and turkeys were introduced to Europe in 1519.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Archenemy</a>: Koschei the Deathless is frequently behind the conspiracies threatening the tsardom. As Nikita puts it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama bin Laden</a> is an amateur compared to this guy.<ul><li> For less serious examples, there's Matryona who sells sauerkraut at the market, and Mitka considers it his civic duty to personally inspect it for quality, frequently calling her the most dangerous criminal in the whole city for "tricking honest people into buying poor-quality sauerkraut."</li><li> Then there's Baba Yaga's rooster, whose adversarial relationship with Nikita is legendary, stemming from the damn bird calling out every sunrise right under Nikita's window. After a few thrown objects, the rooster has grown to be adept at dodging them and will sometimes jump on the windowsill to scream in Nikita's ear just for kicks. However, it does save Nikita and Baba Yaga's lives in one novel by scaring away Koschei (in Russian folklore, evil is supposed to be scared of rooster calls, as they normally herald the sun).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Aristocrats Are Evil</a>: Mostly subverted, but most of the boyars do indeed hate Nikita for daring to treat them as ordinary "citizens", as if they were commoners. In the seventh novel, though, they attempt to execute Nikita after he displeases the Tsar, only for the Tsar to force them to stop at the last moment. In the third novel, they form their own temporary detective agency to find the missing blueprints with a drunk servant and Deacon Filimon Gruzdev at the head in order to show up Nikita. Naturally, neither the Tsar nor Nikita think that the "alternate agency" has a chance in hell of finding the blueprints, and the Tsar asks Nikita to utterly humiliate it, so that he can stick it in the boyars' faces. Boyar Kashkin is a definite subversion, as he deeply respects and supports Nikita, although even he bristles when the Tsar treats Nikita as an equal.<ul><li> When the Tsar goes missing in <em>The Case of the Sober Buffoons</em>, the boyars are quick to lock his wife in her room and temporarily seize power, claiming to act as the sovereign's stewards in his absence. When the incredulous Lydia asks if it's a coup, the surprised boyars tell her that they're simply taking over the masculine duty of running the state; after all, running the nation is not woman's work. Nikita admits to himself that they really are thinking that what they're doing is best for the tsardom and will gladly relinquish power once the Tsar shows up. Which doesn't stop him from summoning his streltsy and having them detain all the mutineers.</li><li> In the 9th book, when Nikita disappears for several days, and Gorokh runs away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to try to rescue his wife himself</span>, the boyars are quick to shut down the detective agency, arrest Baba Yaga, and send Yeremeyev's streltsy to patrol the distant border of the tsardom.</li><li> It's also revealed that Mitka has managed to get the younger boyars to respect the detectives.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>: While the books are hardly historical, one glaring mistake the author has made is his confusion over the Filimon Gruzdev's title and job description. In Russian, his position is "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyak_(clerk)">dyak<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", which basically corresponds to a chief clerk or secretary. It's a secular position that has nothing to do with the Orthodox Church. The author constantly confuses "dyak" with "deacon" (an actual church position), probably because the two words share the same origin. So, in the novels, Gruzdev is both a clerk and a member of the clergy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">"Ass" in Ambassador</a>: The Austrian ambassador Alex Borr is the complete opposite of his gentlemanly Prussian counterpart Knut Spitzruttenberg. He's rude, scheming, and looks at all Russians as if they're beneath him, even the Tsar himself. He's known for his dueling skills and isn't above tricking another into challenging him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out he has a trick sword that allows him an extra few inches at the press of a button, which is how he wins his duels</span>. It's also revealed that, just prior to the events of the fourth book, he secretly demanded sexual favors from Princess Lydia, his own sovereign's daughter, knowing she would be too proper to tell anyone about it. She refused, resulting in him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempting to poison her and several other princesses, as well as stealing the ceremonial mace the Cossacks were going to gift to the Tsar</span>. He returns in a later novel, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">working for Koschei this time</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: Koschei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Cool Swords</a>. They tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">2 meters long</a>. He tries to take one out while on horseback and can't. Later on, he has another sword that clamps to his hand and won't let go until it sheds blood. Nikita admits that it's useful in that it can never be knocked out of Koschei's hand, but then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mitka gets Koschei to stick the sword through a metal gate and then bends the blade, getting it stuck</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard">Badass Beard</a>: Most Russian men in the novels have beards, as shaving wasn't common in Medieval Russia. In fact, during certain periods, it was illegal for commoners to shave. Nikita continues to shave, as beards are against police regulations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a>: Don't anger Baba Yaga if you don't want to end up a toad, or a rooster, a bunny, or a broom. You get the picture. Generally, she'll turn you back after calming down, but you may end up croaking for a while.<ul><li> In the first novel, Nikita accidentally turns himself into a hare after reading a book in Koschei's castle out loud, not realizing it's a spell book. Baba Yaga, initially assuming he's a regular hare and deciding to make soup out of him, realizes the truth and turns him back. Shortly after, Nikita has to run back to check out Koschei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror">Magic Mirror</a>. Yaga turns him back into a hare in order to get there and back faster.</li><li> In the second novel, Baba Yaga turns Mitka into a rooster for Nikita's trip to Koschei's castle. Nikita initially assumes that Mitka is Baba Yaga's rooster (whom he hates for waking him up every sunrise) and nearly kills the "bird" with his saber. Baba Yaga realizes she forgot to give Mitka his human voice back and does that. The reason for the turning is that every evil thing fears a rooster call, so Mitka the Rooster is an insurance policy in case Koschei tries something (which he does).</li><li> In the ninth novel, Zmey Gorynych turns Mitka into a big gray wolf, although Mitka can still speak. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that Zmey doesn't have the power to do that. It was Koschei, who put the spell on Mitka. He tells Nikita how to remove it: take a bath in cold, warm, and then hot water</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory">Been There, Shaped History</a>: In the ninth book, Koschei brags that he and Zmey Gorynych are inadvertently responsible for several historical fires, such as the fire at the Library of Alexandria (they got drunk, wanted to read, and Zmey burped loudly) and the burning of Rome (Zmey had some pizza with sea salt and some local wine, then threw up). He says that their partying across Europe has resulted in common portrayals of dragons and knights. Nikita tells him that it's a good thing he isn't responsible for the fire of Moscow in 1812. Koschei appears interested and asks for the date again, claiming that he'll definitely participate if he lives that long. Nikita mentally curses himself and hopes that historians weren't wrong in blaming Napoleon and Russian patriots for the fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: It's usually no surprise that Koschei the Deathless is usually behind the latest crime. In fact, it's usually surprising when he's not involved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the fourth novel, the villain is the Austrian ambassador Alex Borr. In the sixth, the villain is Koschei's estranged wife, although he is also trying to take advantage of her coming rampage.

In order to catch the poisoner, Baba Yaga orchestrates a public funeral for Nikita, giving him a concoction that immobilizes him for several hours, planning to dig him up later. However, hours pass, and no one comes for him. Luckily, his poisoners decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">make sure he's really dead and dig up the coffin</a>, allowing Nikita to escape.

For example, the blood comes from a guard named Hans Hohenzollern (possibly referring to Hans von K&uuml;strin of House of Hohenzollern). When Nikita asks if this is the same Hohenzollern, the blood replies that it must be a namesake.

She complains at first, claiming that an old mind in a young body is no picnic and that no one is going to respect her back home, while she's looking like a foolish young girl instead of a wizened old woman. Then she grows to like being young and runs away crying when Nikita suggests she remove the spell. He does leave it up to her and is told that, if the spell isn't removed in a month, then it becomes permanent.

Being a stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi">Ashkenazi</a> Jew, it's inevitable. In the fourth novel, he's made the official referee in the Lukoshkino Hockey Championship (as the only unbiased party due to the absence of a Jewish team). He figures out a clever way to make some money on the side while still running a fair game: he privately offers to rig the game to both team captains with the stipulation that he returns the money if the team loses. Thus, no matter what, he gets paid, and nobody can claim the game was rigged. Unfortunately for him, the wives of the captains end up meeting, and the truth comes out. The captains also frequently take him out to dinners. "Coincidentally", his wife and kids show up at the tavern to ask him how he can eat when his children are starving (in fact, he makes a decent living as an undertaker and usurer), causing the other people to feel guilty and feed them as well. Every time Nikita asks Shmulinson to help out in a case, the first words out of Shmulinson's lips are about the payment he can expect for his services.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideousHangoverCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideousHangoverCure">Hideous Hangover Cure</a>: In the fourth novel, Baba Yaga returns from the Tsar drunk on champagne.

The ingredients include brine, valerian, motherwort, ant alcohol, honey, red pepper, <em>gunpowder</em>, rock salt, coal, cardamom, and anise. And it must be mixed with a silver spoon, not a wooden one. Then it turns out Baba Yaga forgot to tell him to add some yeast into the concoction. When Nikita adds the final ingredient, the whole thing blows up (too much anise and yeast, the ant alcohol wasn't properly mixed). Surprisingly, the explosion not only cures Yaga's hangover but also her backache.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalReCreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalReCreation">Historical Re Creation</a>: In the fourth novel, Nikita summons Abram Shmulinson to answer for trying to trick two hockey teams into bribing him, while still reffing a fair game. His arrival turns into a public spectacle. Nikita sees a crowd of people in the distance. When they approach, he sees the Jewish undertaker/carpenter/usurer carrying a big cross on his back. When he finally gets to the precinct, Nikita asks him what the hell he's doing. Shmulinson's explanation is that he was working on a cross for a client of his, so, when the streltsy came to take him to Nikita, he asked if he could finish his work there. They agreed but did not offer their help in carrying the thing. Naturally, on the way, the locals saw a Jewish man carrying a cross and assumed that it was a Bibleic re-enactment, forming a crowd. It doesn't take long for Nikita and Shmulinson to realize that everyone is waiting for the logical conclusion: crucifixion. Nikita sends the people home, although a few monks grumble that it's not Christian to bring a cross and not crucify someone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HockeyFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HockeyFight">Hockey Fight</a>: In the fourth novel, Nikita introduces hockey to the people of Lukoshkino, with many guilds forming teams. Naturally, fights are a frequent occurance, especially against Deacon Filimon Gruzdev, who plays on the Holy Fathers team. The visiting Cossacks also form a team and, being hot-blooded, also get into fights. Nikita mentions that they provide the carpenters with plenty of work, having to replace at least ten hockey sticks after each game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo">Hollywood Voodoo</a>: Tamtamba Mumumba, an Ethiopian princess who arrives to Lukoshkino in the fourth book in an attempt to marry the Tsar, appears to be a voodoo practitioner. She makes wax dolls out of some of her biggest competitors with things like hairs and nail clippings inside. Since magic is real in this setting, it's not a stretch to assume that voodoo works here as well. However, Nikita points out that voodoo only works on someone who believes in it. It's all fine until Tamtamba explains to the Tsar what voodoo is, making him vulnerable to it. Indeed, the very next day he announces that he wishes to marry her. When Nikita searches her room and finds the wax doll of the Tsar, he breaks it open, freeing the Tsar from its spell (in fact, the Tsar doesn't remember the past day at all).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">The Horde</a>: The Shamakhans are a horde of imps who occasionally raid Russian lands.

The toy model (that looks like a regular ship) lifts straight up into the air, make a circle, and lands on the same spot. He explains that the craftsmen are scaling up the model to full size. He treats it as nothing more than a novelty, while Nikita realizes the enormity of such an invention (i.e. any nation would pay a king's ransom to get its hands on it and build an unstoppable air force). Naturally, the plans for the ship get stolen by Koschei, who ends up building a full-size ship of his own. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the full-size ship does exactly the same thing that the toy model did (i.e. fly around a bit and land on the same spot).

The art involves a warrior screaming in such a way as to defeat a whole army. Mitka just so happens to be in the vicinity and makes a bet with the Tsar who can kill a squirrel with his scream.

If Nikita completes them successfully, then Koschei will release his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> from servitude. If not, the he will kill Nikita and his friends. The first task is to clean the villain's enormous castle by the end of the day using nothing but a handkerchief and a magical thimble that never runs out of water. Nikita has Baba Yaga grow the thimble to an enormous size and flips it over, flooding the castle. In order to avoid rusting his armor, Koschei admits that the task is successfully completed. He then assigns the second task as removing all the water by midnight. Baba Yaga uses one of Koschei's own magical coals that are always hot to heat up the water to create an impromptu steam spa. Koschei, who loathes bathing and steaming of any kind gives them this round as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>: In the third novel, Nikita meets a pretty girl named Olyona.

During her youth, she ran a brothel in the city's version of a red light district, but has grown to resent that life over the years and became a nun to atone for the sins of youth. When Nikita, Baba Yaga, and Yeremeyev visit the convent to ask about Gorokh's missing cousin, they are, at first, met with a dozen flintlock guns pointing at them from the battlements. When Nikita requests to speak with Mother Fevronia, she invites him and Baba Yaga in, but demands that Yeremeyev stay outside with the horse and buggy. As they're being led through the convent, Nikita is surprised to see far too many young, attractive women in black cowls than one would expect in a convent, and almost no old women. He quickly learns that Fevronia has not only <em>not</em> given up her old ways but has, in fact, turned the convent into a secret brothel, forcing the initially-unsuspecting girls to sleep with clients.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny">Never Mess with Granny</a>: Baba Yaga may look like an old crone who can barely walk, but she's a powerful witch who can put a curse on those who offend her before they know what hit them. Sometimes, the curse is hilarious (like making the person always speak the truth or making a man speak with a woman's voice), while other times, she can turn the unfortunate person into an animal or an inanimate object (she'll turn him back after calming down). Additionally, in <em>The Case of the Sober Buffoons</em>, Yaga fends off four Asian martial artists with nothing but her cane. She explains that she had to learn to defend herself back in the day when many young heroes would try to get fresh with her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide">Never Suicide</a>: In the first novel, one of the suspects in the theft of the chest full of gold coins from the Tsar's treasury is Tyurya, the treasurer. However, shortly after being questioned by Nikita, he is found in his home seemingly having hung himself. Everybody assumes Nikita drove him to suicide, but Nikita immediately notices certain inconsistencies, such as the fact that Tyurya would have had to stand on a ladder to hang himself so high off the floor, and the ladder is nowhere to be found. Nikita has no doubt that the treasurer is the victim of a murder. Baba Yaga, after taking a look at the body confirms that someone choked Tyurya from behind with a rope and then put him in a noose.

Both have normal human (very attractive) legs and are wearing thin dresses that leave little to the imagination (it helps that the dresses are wet). The myth of the fishtails was spread by women to keep their husbands away from the mermaids. Una and Dina give Nikita what he asks but demand payment in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonPoolParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonPoolParty">three-person river party</a>.

After they reveal the information to get their stuff back, they explain that they've mastered every card game known to man and were just playing along, letting Nikita win, so they'd be justified in helping authorities without looking like snitches.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>: In later books, Baba Yaga gets a new domovoi (house spirit) named Nazim, whose hot Azerbaijani blood boils whenever someone threatens Baba Yaga, causing him to grab his knife.

In the ninth book, Nikita meets Emelya from the well-known folk tale "Emelya and the Pike". Nikita is a little surprised to find out that he's still living in the same hamlet he grew up in instead of the tsardom he supposedly received from a tsar. Emelya explains that, along with the wisdom the Pike has given him, came the knowledge that running a tsardom is <em>frigging hard</em>, especially with zero prior experience. Also, the tsar's daughter he received in marriage left him as soon as he lifted the love spell. The same wisdom also made him realize that he only wanted her to be with him of her own free will. Thus, he's right back where he's started, in an even worse situation than before, as the house was destroyed by the magical stove, and he's haunted by the knowledge that he has achieved nothing in his life.

When Foma Yeremeyev tells him that realoading their pischals (primitive matchlock firearms) would take too long, Nikita settles for this trope.

However, his tastes are a little too avant-garde for the Medieval Russian folk (he admits he can paint as expected, but it's boring). For example, when he gifts a religious painting to Baba Yaga, she is shocked to see anatomically-correct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Adam and Eve</a> portrayed in the nude. When asked to paint portraits of most wanted criminals to be displayed on the gates of the agency, he first paints them as if they were saints.

The latter turns out to be useful in scaring away the invading Shamakhans, who are equally scared to approach the city gates where the portraits are displayed.

Later on, Nikita is called by the guards to a square where the deacon is loudly telling the crowd of onlookers certain things about the boyars, the priests, and the Tsar. Nikita acknowledges that the powder indeed works but worries that the deacon may lose his head over this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski">Vodka Drunkenski</a>: It wouldn't be Russia without this trope. Naturally, vodka is the alcoholic beverage of choice, although moonshine shows up occasionally. In the seventh novel, the Tsar insists on drinking warm sake or, at least, what he calls "sake". Nikita insists that it's nothing more than watered-down and heated vodka. The German ambassador will, occasionally, gift Nikita with some imported schnapps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>:<ul><li> Koschei the Deathless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">cannot be killed</a> by any weapon. However, throw some salt on him, and his flesh will melt away. Not only is it extremely painful for him, but it also takes him a <em>long</em> time to recover. He's also afraid of rooster calls. Koschei's wife also has his weakness to salt, which is why he had her imprisoned under a whole mountain of it.</li><li> Being a cold-blooded creature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Zmey Gorynych</a> is extremely vulnerable to cold. In fact, his castle has a number of large furnaces heating it, and he still wears warm clothes inside, when in his human form. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nikita goes to Grandfather Frost (Russian Santa Claus) for help, who loans him his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">Freeze Ray</a> staff</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a>: <em>Tsar Gorokh's Rusty Sword</em> is primarily Nikita reminiscing about an old case that chronologically took place between the second and third novels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">Wicked Witch</a>: Baba Yaga claims to have killed quite a few heroes in her younger days. Now, she is reformed and lives in the city, after moving out of her traditional "house on chicken legs" home in the woods. In the seventh novel, though, she admits that not all rumors about her are true. Specifically, the ones about her eating children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel">Wizard Duel</a>: In <em>The Case of the Sober Buffoons</em>, Yaga is confronted by a circus magician who turns out to be a certified sorcerer (he has a degree in Black Magic and everything). Naturally, Baba Yaga manages to one-up the sorcerer at every round. For example, when he turns his fingers into poisonous snakes, she lights the snakes on fire, causing him to jump around, trying to put his fingers out. In fact, one round doesn't even involve Yaga using magic. When the sorcerer turns into an enormous raven, she takes out a slingshot and puts a pebble into his eye. Yaga wins by default when the sorcerer is knocked out by Mitka throwing a strongman at him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: In the third novel, a woman wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">cap of invisibility</a> attacks the precinct in an attempt to kill the last surviving witness.

The two women fall into a vat of water, and the red-headed woman appears to have fallen on her own knife. Later, Nikita is made to realize that Olyona has been working for Koschei all this time. She is the one who attacks the precinct and then kills a fellow criminal to frame her. She does admit it all to Nikita at the end of the novel, explaining that she is forced to serve Koschei until the end of the end of the deal. She still falls for Nikita, though</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: In the first novel, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the treasurer Tyurya, after being finally brought before Tsar Gorokh, immediately realizes that the Tsar has been replaced with a doppelganger and nearly blows the con. Realizing this, the "Tsar" has his goons kill him on the spot while claiming that this is punishment for treason</span>. In fact, Koschei has a habit of "removing" any servant that has been captured by Nikita and feels absolutely no sense of loyalty to those under him. At least two times, Nikita gets distracted from a promising lead for a minute or two, only to come back and find a knife sticking out of said lead's chest, left there by an unknown assassin.</li></ul>
