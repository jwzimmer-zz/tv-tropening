<p></p><p>During the 70s and 80s, in the days before video took off, the way to catch up on previous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> stories was by reading the novelisations from Target Books, which retold (and frequently expanded on) the stories on TV.</p><p>Notable authors included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerranceDicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerranceDicks">Terrance Dicks</a> (who wrote more <em>Doctor Who</em> novelisations than anyone else), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmHulke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmHulke">Malcolm Hulke</a>, Philip Hinchcliffe, Ian Marter, and David Whitaker, all of whom had worked on the TV series in various capacities.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Target Books was established in 1973, publishing TV novelisations and other books for children. The <em>Doctor Who</em> line was its most successful, and in later years the two became synonymous: "Target Books" meant <em>Doctor Who</em> novelisations and vice versa.</p><p>Because Target's target audience was children, the novelisations used simplified language and were stuck with a maximum page count of around 150 pages, even for epics like the 10-part "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames">The War Games</a>". A special concession was made for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan">The Daleks' Master Plan</a>", 13 episodes including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E2MissionToTheUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E2MissionToTheUnknown">the prologue</a>, which was published in two volumes, although this was very late in the series where the books were being marketed to the adult fan-collector market as much as to the original child audience. The quality of the writing varies considerably, from thin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeigeProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeigeProse">Beige Prose</a> to relatively sophisticated works that took time to fill out characters' personalities and backstories; Malcolm Hulke's novelisations, for instance, were notable examples of the latter type.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The first three <em>Doctor Who</em> novelisations, <em>Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure With the Daleks</em> (based on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks">The Daleks</a>" and reprinted as <em>Doctor Who and the Daleks</em>), <em>Doctor Who and the Crusaders</em> (based on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E6TheCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E6TheCrusade">The Crusade</a>"), and <em>Doctor Who and the Zarbi</em> (based on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E5TheWebPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E5TheWebPlanet">The Web Planet</a>") were originally published by Frederick Muller in the 1960s, before Target Books reprinted them and bought the rights to new novelisations. The Target series began with <em>Doctor Who and the Auton Invasion</em>, written by Terrance Dicks and based on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E1SpearheadFromSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E1SpearheadFromSpace">Spearhead from Space</a>".</p><p>Circa 1979, ten of the novelisations were brought to America by Pinnacle Books. The reprints had a foreword by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a>, some edits to make them US-friendly (jelly babies changed to jelly beans, etc.) and covers that never actually showed the Doctor or the TARDIS.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>As the '80's wore on, Target began to branch out. It did abridged versions of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot">Robot</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius">The Brain of Morbius</a>" novelisations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedForChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedForChildren">for younger children</a> under the Junior Doctor Who sub-series. It adapted the audio drama <em>Doctor Who and the Pescatons</em> into <em>The Pescatons</em>, as well as another audio story, <em>Slipback</em>. It novelised <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/K9AndCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/K9AndCompany">K-9 and Company</a></em> under the Companions of Doctor Who sub-series, which had previously included the original novels <em>Turlough and the Earthlink Dilemma</em> by Tony Attwood and <em>Harry Sullivan's War</em>, written by Ian Marter, the Target author who had played Harry on <em>Doctor Who</em>. Three novelisations of the original, cancelled Season 23 stories <em>The Nightmare Fair</em>, <em>The Ultimate Evil</em> and <em>Mission to Magnus</em> appeared under another sub-series, <em>The Missing Adventures</em>.</p><p>In 1990, Target's parent company, W H Allen, became Virgin Publishing. They brought out the remaining unadapted novelisations under the Target imprint, and started a new line of original Doctor Who novels, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a>. The last original Target novelisations, none of which carried the Target logo on the cover (and are hence not considered to be "true" Target books by some purists, although they feature the logo and are identified as being part of the Target Library on the frontispiece), were radio play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheParadiseOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheParadiseOfDeath">The Paradise of Death</a></em> and TV stories "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks">The Power of the Daleks</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E9TheEvilOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E9TheEvilOfTheDaleks">The Evil of the Daleks</a>". The final book under the Target imprint was a reprint of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E6TheTalonsOfWengChiang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E6TheTalonsOfWengChiang">The Talons of Weng-Chiang</a>" in 1994.</p><p>There were just four TV stories that did not receive a Target novelisation (not including the unfinished "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E6Shada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E6Shada">Shada</a>"): the two Dalek stories by Eric Saward, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E4ResurrectionOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E4ResurrectionOfTheDaleks">Resurrection of the Daleks</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E6RevelationOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E6RevelationOfTheDaleks">Revelation of the Daleks</a>", due to conflict between Saward and Terry Nation's agent about the division of royalties; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a>' other two stories, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E2ThePiratePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E2ThePiratePlanet">The Pirate Planet</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E2CityOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E2CityOfDeath">City of Death</a>", because Adams wanted the novelisations to be done by someone who could do justice to the material (namely, himself) but having hit the big time with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> he was too busy, or too expensive, or both.</p><p>In 1995, the radio drama <em>The Ghosts of N-Space</em> was novelised as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoMissingAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoMissingAdventures">Doctor Who Missing Adventures</a>. In 1996, BBC Books released a novelisation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie">the TV movie</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulMcGann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulMcGann">Paul McGann</a>, and in 2004 the animated webcast "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ScreamOfTheShalka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ScreamOfTheShalka">Scream of the Shalka</a>" was novelised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulCornell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulCornell">Paul Cornell</a> as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PastDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PastDoctorAdventures">Past Doctor Adventures</a> range.</p><p>In 2007 the BBC began releasing audiobooks of the novelisations, read by a cast member; several stories had entirely new adaptations written, often due to dissatisfaction with the original on the author's part. Also that year, Telos Publishing published <em>The Target Book</em>, a guide to the history of Target and its <em>Doctor Who</em> novelisations.</p><p>In 2011, the BBC reissued six of the novelisations in new editions with introductions by writers including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter">Stephen Baxter</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>. In 2012, they reissued six more. In 2013, when the BBC reissued a spin-off novel for each Doctor as part of the 50th anniversary, the first six were Past Doctor Adventures released in the late 1990s and 2000s, but the Seventh Doctor's was the 1990 novelisation of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E1RemembranceOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E1RemembranceOfTheDaleks">Remembrance of the Daleks</a>". In 2016, they reissued ten more novelisations, three of which were hardback facsimiles of the original Frederick Muller novelisations.</p><p>In 2012, BBC Books published the first new novelisation in years: Gareth Roberts' novelisation of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E6Shada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E6Shada">Shada</a>". Unlike previous novelisations, it was aimed at a general audience, and clocked in at approximately 400 pages. James Goss's novelisation of "City of Death" followed in 2015, with his novelisation of "The Pirate Planet" officially completing the set of Adams-related novelisations in 2017. Goss's novelisation of Adams' unmade film proposal "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen" (best known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">as the basis for</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a></em>) was released in 2018, followed in 2019 by <em>Scratchman</em>, a collaboration between Goss and Tom Baker, adapting "Doctor Who Meets Scratchman", an unproduced screenplay Baker had co-written with Ian Marter. Eric Saward adapted his two 80s Dalek serials as Target-length books for BBC Books in 2019, meaning every classic serial at last had a novelisation.</p><p>BBC Books released the first novelisations of stories from the revival series in 2018, resurrecting the Target logo for the covers: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E1Rose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E1Rose">Rose</a>", novelised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2005CSTheChristmasInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2005CSTheChristmasInvasion">The Christmas Invasion</a>", novelised by Jenny Colgan, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">The Day of the Doctor</a>", novelised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2017CSTwiceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2017CSTwiceUponATime">Twice Upon a Time</a>", novelised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulCornell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulCornell">Paul Cornell</a>.

Also, Garron's line about dying being the last thing he'll do is given to the Doctor and rewritten to remove much of the humour.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalExplanation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalExplanation">Adaptational Explanation</a>:<ul><li> In "The Daleks", the pacifist Thals are under threat of being wiped out by the Daleks but refuse to compromise their ideals, even in self-defence, until Ian proves that they do have things they're willing to fight for by seizing the Thal leader Alydon's fianc&eacute;e and pretending he's going to trade her to the Daleks for his own safety, which prompts Alydon to punch him in the face. The TV version never explains how a man from a society that has been entirely pacifist for generations came by the idea of punching people, apparently assuming it to be something that all men know instinctively; the novelisation adds a scene in which one of Ian's earlier attempts to bring the Thals around to the idea of constructive violence involved describing and demonstrating the sport of boxing.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction">The Edge of Destruction</a>", the blinding flash is qualified to be not the Big Bang, for not even the TARDIS could survive such an event, but instead the birth of the Milky Way Galaxy.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E5TheKeysOfMarinus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E5TheKeysOfMarinus">The Keys of Marinus</a>", Yartek is said to have developed a technological immuniser that he distributed amongst his followers rather than the unexplained resistance to the Conscience's pacifying influence of the televised version.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E7TheSensorites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E7TheSensorites">The Sensorites</a>", Maitland's assumption that the travellers come from a century other than the twenty-eighth stems from a commonplace tradition to place astronauts in suspended animation for the long journey between solar systems.</li><li> In <em>Doctor Who and the Zarbi</em>, the Doctor slices away the web that snares Ian with a slender spar of fallen rock. The trap is noted to be statically charged, explaining the blisters on the schoolteacher's face and arms.</li><li> "The Time Meddler":<ul><li> Steven making his way through the jungle on Mechanus trying to avoid the fungoids and coming across the TARDIS. (The TV version of "The Chase" and "The Time Meddler" had Steven apparently left behind on Mechanus and then turning up in the TARDIS without a detailed explanation of how he found it.)</li><li> It's specified that the Monk's anachronistic weaponry was inside his sabotaged TARDIS, making it inaccessible to him. Also, Steven disarmed the Monk's cannons before leaving.</li></ul></li><li> In "The Daleks' Masterplan", as the Daleks use taranium to power their time machines, they reveal that they do in fact have some supplies of taranium in their possession, gathered without Mavic Chen's help. However, it is explained that the amount needed to power the Time Destructor is greater than that needed for the time machines, hence why they needed Chen's help in the first place.</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E6TheArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E6TheArk">The Ark</a>" explains how Monoid One is the leader.

It is explained that she took it from the Dalek City.</li><li> The Doctor concludes that the 22nd century Dalek invasion of Earth has not yet taken place, explaining why the colonists are unfamiliar with the threat of the Daleks.</li></ul></li><li> "The Underwater Menace":<ul><li> It is stated by Ara that Zaroff walks through the market place every day to inspect the drill head, thus this is where the Doctor stages his kidnap attempt; in the television story, the only reason he goes through the market is to look for the Doctor.</li><li> It is explained by Sean that the Atlanteans do not settle on the surface because they consider their ground sacred.</li><li> It is said that Zaroff saved Thous from a deadly disease thought fatal by the Atlanteans, thus why Thous trusts Zaroff more.</li></ul></li><li> In "The Faceless Ones", the Director states that processed humans die and the transference becomes permanent in four weeks, explaining why the originals of the Chameleon Tours staff are left behind at Gatwick.</li><li> In "The Web of Fear", the Doctor explains his not revealing himself to the soldiers by saying they would arrest or shoot him, giving Jamie further motivation for not revealing his existence to them.</li><li> In "Fury from the Deep", the Doctor explains that the Weed Creature transported Maggie to the control rig by encasing her in its foam.</li><li> In "The Seeds of Death", it's explained how Jamie and Phipps save the Doctor from being T-Matted into space. They do so by removing the panels from behind the T-Mat cubicle and replacing them whilst Fewsham distracts the Warrior on guard with adjustments. (Most of this is evident in the televised story, however, and as there Fewsham is unaware of what they are doing.)</li><li> In "Inferno", it is explained that the Doctor plans to use a power surge from the project's reactor to overload the blocks placed on the TARDIS.</li><li> In "Terror of the Autons", the Brigadier suggests mass producing the machine the Doctor used to destroy the Autons before but the Doctor points out it has to be used at close range and the Autons may have evolved a defence.</li><li> In "The Mind of Evil", there are a few extra lines of dialogue and thoughts to cover minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">plot holes</a>: Summers worries about Barnham being left behind in the infirmary during the attempted break-out and the Brigadier reflects that he cannot involve the army in liberating Stangmoor Prison for political reasons (presumably the secrecy surrounding the Thunderbolt).</li><li> In "The Time Monster", the lack of casualties in the Roundhead battle is explained by Yates ordering his men to fire above their heads.</li><li> "Planet of the Spiders":<ul><li> Lupton's spider explains he cannot use the web to stun his pursuers because they are too many and too distant.</li><li> Lupton offers to take a patrol to search for Sarah, explaining his appearance in the village.</li><li> The Doctor says he knows Clegg is a psychic because he can sense his vibrations.</li><li> Barnes states Lupton was strong enough to perform the ceremony on his own, presumably to explain how he transported to Metebelis.</li></ul></li><li> A major plot hole is filled in with "Genesis of the Daleks": onscreen Sarah is told she and the other Kaled and Muto prisoners of the Thals will die from distronic toxaemia because of the explosives they are using to fill the Thals' rocket. Onscreen they finish the job, Sarah is rescued, and it's never mentioned again. In the book she only does one shift filling the rocket with explosives before it's done, and she wonders whether her limited exposure will keep her from getting sick (and apparently it does).</li><li> In "Planet of Evil," it is explained that the liquid that Sorenson is drinking is a special elixir of his own devising to stave off his transformations (which he suspects are happening due to his exposure to anti-matter), and that he can't make any more. We're never told onscreen exactly what it is, why it works, and why he is so upset when he runs out.</li><li> In "Pyramids of Mars", Ernie Clements going to the lodge is explained as him looking for Laurence for help.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion">The Android Invasion</a>", several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles">Plot Holes</a> are filled in, such as what happened to Chedaki (who disappears without explanation about an episode before the end of the televised story).</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E2TheHandOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E2TheHandOfFear">The Hand of Fear</a>":<ul><li> Sarah surviving the blast in the quarry is explained as her finding shelter under an overhang.</li><li> It is explained that Watson keeps a gun in case of a terrorist attack.</li></ul></li><li> In "The Face of Evil," it is explained that the Doctor met the ancestors of the Sevateem and attempted to repair Xoanon after taking a brief trip in the TARDIS not long after his regeneration, during the events of "Robot." Onscreen it is never explained exactly when this visit happened. This also explains why his attempted repair goes so wrong: he's still in post-regenerative shock, so using his own mind as a template for Xoanon is just really bad timing.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E1HorrorOfFangRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E1HorrorOfFangRock">Horror of Fang Rock</a>", the reason Vince burns Lord Palmerdale's bribe money following his death is because he is concerned that he may be accused of murder should he be found to have the money.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E5Underworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E5Underworld">Underworld</a>", the subject of the Doctor's painting aboard the TARDIS is left ambiguous on television. In the novelisation he mentions that he is repainting a spare control room in aquamarine blue, after the TARDIS's own refusal to redecorate herself.</li><li> In "The Invasion of Time", it is revealed that the Doctor first learnt of the Vardans' attempted invasion of Gallifrey via a telepathic warning from the Matrix. Also, the hole the Doctor made in the force-field is regenerating itself, explaining the Sontarans' need to shut it down.</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E5TheHornsOfNimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E5TheHornsOfNimon">The Horns of Nimon</a>" contains an extended prologue that explains how Soldeed first met the Nimon - he's sent inside the Nimon vessel at gunpoint to make First Contact because he's the closest thing they have to a scientist (he's just a technician). After the Nimon give him the power to take over what's left of the Skonnon Empire, he gets delusions of grandeur and tries to act like a real scientist, which throws him for a loop when the Doctor shows up. Also, when Seth shoots at Soldeed, he hits the console, explaining why the controls are jammed.</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E1DestinyOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E1DestinyOfTheDaleks">Destiny of the Daleks</a>", the environment of Skaro is said to be the remains of the old Kaled city with a concrete floor, explaining why the dead prisoners are buried under rocks.</li><li> In "City of Death", the Doctor gives the remaining Mona Lisa to Duggan at the end; the televised version is vague as to what happened to it.</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E2Meglos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E2Meglos">Meglos</a>" answers the question of how Meglos' species would be able to advance technologically as immobile cacti by their ability to take over the minds of other beings, implying that, despite what was shown, they are able to do it without technological adjuncts.</li><li> "Warriors' Gate" reveals the fate of the rogue Gundan and how the slavers ended up in the void.</li><li> "Four to Doomsday":<ul><li> It is explained the TARDIS only travelled a short distance because Tegan failed to use the power booster.</li><li> It is explained that the TARDIS only travelled a short distance because Tegan failed to use the power booster.</li></ul></li><li> In "Kinda", it is explained that Hindle turned the monitor off in order to avoid distraction, hence him missing Aris' attack.</li><li> In "The Visitation", it's explained that the Doctor realizes who the Terileptils are because they left their tag on their escape capsule; this was not explained in the televised story.</li><li> In "Earthshock", the sudden and unexplained reactivation of the Cyber-Leader's secondary garrison is explained as a side-effect of the secret passageway to the Cybermen's makeshift control centre slamming shut, setting the delicate instrumentation of their equipment into action and reviving the warriors.</li><li> In "Arc of Infinity", the Matrix Crown on Gallifrey is explained as only to be used in strict emergencies as direct consultation with the "strange combination of group-mind and race-memory" is extremely dangerous and stressful to the wearer. Omega's convulsive cry is clarified to be the result of his servant's disintegration, rather than a side-effect of the ongoing transformation.</li><li> In "Snakedance", the Doctor explains that "Sumaran Empire" translates to "Empire of the Mara". It is established that Nyssa remembers Tegan read out the co-ordinates for Manussa but keeps quiet to keep her out of trouble.</li><li> In "Enlightenment", Wrack explains that the drink she gives Turlough is muscatel and she ripped the taste from the mind of a buccaneer captain.</li><li> In "The King's Demons", it is established that Sir Gilles brought the Iron Maiden to the castle. It is also mentioned that the gaoler, named as Cedric, was Sir Geoffrey's steward until Sir Gilles gave him his new position. Also, Turlough is with Sir Geoffrey when he is wounded and helps him to the barn, making more sense of his later claim that he tried to help him.</li><li> In "Warriors of the Deep", Tegan's foot is undamaged when trapped under the heavy door "by a kind of freak accident". Also, It is specified that the marine guards normally function as radiation crew, explaining their uniforms.</li><li> In "The Awakening", Wolsey's sudden appearance to capture Tegan is explained as him stepping out of an alley.</li><li> In "The Caves of Androzani", the lack of soldiers other than Chellak approaching Jek's base is explained as the survivors having pulled back to avoid the mud burst. Also, the motor sound that leads Morgus and Stotz to Jek's hideout is explained as him turning the extractor fan back on to keep Peri cool.</li><li> In "Vengeance on Varos", the cannibals are explained as the relatives of those executed in the Punishment Dome, left to fend for themselves when they have nobody to support them.</li><li> In "The Mark of the Rani", it is explained that the Master instructed Luke to lure Peri and Stephenson to the dell as bait for the Doctor.</li><li> In "The Two Doctors", it is made clear that Oscar and Anita are on their way to summon help when they first summon the Sixth Doctor. Also, Jamie's attack on Peri causes the Doctor to smash a glass tube in the box he is working on, explaining the gas jet.</li><li> In "Timelash":<ul><li> the Doctor explains that he "turned the TARDIS&#146;s polarity into a field of negative energy" to attract the bendalypse warhead away from Karfel. When it impacted, they simply dematerialised.</li><li> The small population of the planet is explained by most of them being wiped out by a famine. The Doctor showed them how to produce food artificially and, along with Maylin Makrif, negotiated the deal with the Bandrils to supply them with grain in exchange for power cells.</li><li> The Doctor explains how he and Herbert survived the Bendalypse warhead hitting the TARDIS: They time-shifted an hour into the future, with the warhead only destroying living matter.</li></ul></li><li> "Time and the Rani" opens with a prologue explaining how the Sixth Doctor regenerated &mdash; he banged his head on the TARDIS console.<ul><li> It is explained that Sarn escapes because she is worried of being punished for helping the Doctor.</li><li> An explanation is given for how the Rani escaped her plight at the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E3TheMarkOfTheRani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E3TheMarkOfTheRani">The Mark of the Rani</a>": As the tyrannosaur grew to full size, its spine snapped against the roof of her TARDIS.</li></ul></li><li> In "Dragonfire", the ridiculous cliffhanger for part one is elaborated on &mdash; the Doctor is using his umbrella to try and reach a ledge lower down the cliff, but slips and loses his footing.<ul><li> Stellar's mother is dragged away by the fleeing crowd, explaining why she is left behind.</li></ul></li><li> In "Battlefield", Excalibur's signal causes a storm, which is what grounds the convoy. Plus, Ancelyn is specified as the one who killed the Knight Commander.</li><li> "Ghost Light":<ul><li> It is established that Matthews saw Josiah and Gwendoline in London and has come to Gabriel Chase partly because he wants to save her innocence.</li><li> It is explained that Josiah has <em>The Times</em> delivered to Control as a taunt since he knows she won't understand it.</li><li> It is explained that Mrs Pritchard tricked Redvers into wandering into Light's spaceship, causing his insanity.</li></ul></li><li> In "The Curse of Fenric":<ul><li> Miss Hardaker, the prudish old woman who is billeting the evacuees, states that as a younger woman she got pregnant after a reckless visit to Maiden's Point with a boy she knew, hence her bitterness about the subject in the present day.</li><li> The refugees are said to have arrived that day, explaining why Bates mistakes Ace for one.</li></ul></li><li> "Rose":<ul><li> The Doctor blows up Henrik's because the building is infested with plastic.</li><li> The Doctor tells Rose that the Time War rewrote the Nestene's history so it is now made of plastic instead of just controlling it.</li></ul></li><li> In "Twice Upon a Time", the First Doctor&#146;s uncharacteristic behaviour is explained as a ploy to get on the nerves of the Twelfth Doctor, as he didn&#146;t like him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>: In the TV version of "Shada", Salyavin is a reformed villain; in the novelisation, he was never actually a villain at all, but just misunderstood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">Adaptational Jerkass</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Doctor Who and the Dinosaur Invasion</em>, Whitaker is portrayed as much more selfish and arrogant, and as having a far more hostile relationship with Butler, than on television, with his main priority being proving his theories work.</li><li> In the novelisation of "The Twin Dilemma", Hugo Lang is a less sympathetic character than on screen, dreaming of becoming a celebrity by rescuing the twins without any real personal risk, considering abandoning the Doctor and Peri on Jaconda and staying behind because he thinks Slarn will pay him highly to be his bodyguard.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJobChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJobChange">Adaptational Job Change</a>:<ul><li> In the novelisation of "Death to the Daleks", Railton is said to be a scientist rather than a marine captain, although he is still specified as being senior to Galloway.</li><li> In <em>Doctor Who and the Giant Robot</em>, Jellicoe is said to be Thinktank's Public Relations Officer rather than Hilda Winters' assistant.</li><li> In the novelisation of "Survival", Paterson is a police sergeant as opposed to being a Territorial Army sergeant as originally intended.</li><li> In the novelisation of "Rose", Wilson's position at Hernik's is Senior Caretaker instead of Chief Electrical Officer.</li><li> In "The Curse of Fenric", the marines that Jean and Phyllis tease and who are later killed by the Russians are replaced with a group of Home Guard, who Miss Hardaker asked to look for the pair.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalKarma">Adaptational Karma</a>: In "The Daleks' Masterplan", both Chen and Karlton are exposed as traitors when Marc Cory's recorded message is found to have been in Bret Vyon's possession.

In the novelisation, Sir Geoffory is mortally wounded and his injuries are treated to by the Doctor, allowing him to part company with Ranulf and Isabella on good terms.</li><li> In "The Caves of Androzani", instead of forcing Morgus' head into a laser beam, Jek strangles him and then hurls him into a console which explodes.</li><li> In "The Two Doctors", Shockeye kills the lorry driver with a neck snap rather than hitting him across the back with a log.</li><li> In "Revelation of the Daleks", instead of being killed by a single levitating Dalek, Gigory and Natasha are attacked by three Daleks.

The three novels originally published in the 1960s weren't subject to the familiar Target rules; in particular, they're all well over 150 pages. While <em>Doctor Who and the Zarbi</em> is pitched at about the same reading level as Target aimed for, David Whitaker's two are aimed at adult readers, with developed characters, polished prose, and, it has to be said, a certain amount of child-unfriendly violence. The first one takes the form of a first person account by Ian Chesterton. Additionally, they sometimes refer to the Doctor (in description, not dialogue) as "Doctor Who".

She becomes a serious fan, and eventually forces Skagra to watch them all with her in the hope that he'll learn some good moral lessons from the stories.

When the Doctor sends Adric and Nyssa away from Logopolis, he entrusts them to the Watcher. Aboard the TARDIS, the Watcher silently summons Adric alone and apparently has a dialogue with him. Afterward, Adric claims that although he remembers the Watcher's instructions, he can't quite remember what the Watcher's voice sounded like except that it sounded familiar.</li><li> In "Rose", Clive tells Rose a theory that people's memories of alien encounters have been wiped by cracks in time, presaging the revelations in Series 5.</li><li> In the novelisation of "The Day of the Doctor", Kate frequently calls Osgood "Petronella", predating the name being revealed in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E8TheZygonInversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E8TheZygonInversion">The Zygon Inversion</a>".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a>: Played with in the novelisation of "The Mind Robber", the adventure in which the Doctor and his companions visit the Land of Fiction.

Romana is horrified and expresses pity for his people, until Skagra informs her that it happened thousands of years before he was born and that they were not his people.

This reinforced an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> present in the original story but emphasized in the novelisation that the villains consisted of emotional cripples who wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a> away the present world because they just didn't fit in with the current one.

John Lucarotti's scripts were completely rewritten by script editor Donald Tosh, and when the time came to do the novelisation Lucarotti was unwilling to novelise the transmitted story, but no longer had copies of his original scripts and couldn't remember what happened in them (it was one of many sixties stories that was only novelised many years later, after all the more popular stories had been done).

Gareth Roberts wrote in the afterword about how he thought the weaknesses of "Shada" were not down to any weakness of Douglas Adams himself, but a result of the tight deadline the story was written in originally, evidenced by how well-done the groundwork was even where he had to fix things. For instance, the original has a part where Chris figures out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that Professor Chronotis is secretly the dangerous Time Lord criminal Salyavin, placed just as the Doctor has worked out that the villain needs Salyavin's unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBeam">Exposition Beam</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPower">Psychic Power</a> for the plot to work, <em>and</em> just as the villain thinks Salyavin is lost forever. It seems obvious that Chris is going to announce this to the Doctor and the villain, with the best intentions, at the worst possible time - but Chronotis instead just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">announces his secret identity to everyone for no reason</a>. Roberts changes this so that Chris blows it (bursting in on an added funny scene where the villain is in the throes of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> over his plan's failure and the Doctor is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">giving his enemy a cuddle and reassurance</a>), saying that this is certainly what Adams wanted to happen anyway, but probably was forced to keep an earlier draft of the scene due to time pressures.

What it is mostly padded with is lots and lots of torture scenes that are irrelevant to the plot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization">Tuckerization</a>: Two of the colonists in "Frontios" are called Kernighan and Ritchie. They are named for Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, well known in the computer world for writing the definitive guide to the C programming language.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyopOnTheCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyopOnTheCover">Tyop on the Cover</a>: The novelisation of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS24E3DeltaAndTheBannermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS24E3DeltaAndTheBannermen">Delta and the Bannermen</a>" has a typo on the spine, where there is only one Bannerman. (This is nothing to the typo that occurs within, at a point where one of the characters is supposed to be <em>peering</em> over a shelf.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableIllustrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableIllustrator">Unreliable Illustrator</a>: The 1960s and 1970s novelisations were published with illustrations, which, although they didn't contradict the text, had clearly been made by somebody who'd never seen the television versions. (In some cases, not only were the details of the scene different, so were the faces of the characters.) This wasn't all bad, though. Some of the monsters are much more convincing in illustrated form than they were <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

There is no Chapter 9, reflecting the Ninth Doctor's absence from the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll">Warts and All</a>: According to "The Day of the Doctor" novelisation, Osgood hero-worships the Doctor, but after she learned how the Doctor (thought he'd) ended the Time War, she accepted he couldn't always be a hero, and decided that meant a few more heroes would be needed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchThePaintJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchThePaintJob">Watch the Paint Job</a>: In "Battlefield", it's mentioned that Shou Yuing's 2CV had been repainted only the previous week. As in the TV serial, it gets damaged beyond repair when Morgaine's troops ambush it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>: There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the novelisation of "Shada" that everybody, including the Doctor, instantly dismisses any negative or suspicious thought they have about Chronotis by deciding that he is just a "nice old man". This is strongly implied to be the result of a low-key use of his powers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: In the novelisation of "The Sea Devils", the Master tells the Doctor off for murdering the Sea Devils and then claiming the moral high ground.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">Wicked Cultured</a>: In "The Gunfighters", Johnny Ringo spends much of his earnings as a hired gun on classic works and delights in conversing with the Doctor in Latin phrases.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: In "The Hand of Fear", the Doctor lures Sarah across the chasm by pretending to be in trouble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">Writing Around Trademarks</a>: In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E5TheGreenDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E5TheGreenDeath">The Green Death</a>", the name of the evil chemical company was changed from the original Global Chemicals to Panorama Chemicals, due to legal threats from a real Global Chemicals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenSoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenSoundEffect">Written Sound Effect</a>: In the novelisation of "The Mind Robber", the Karkus's more violent actions are accompanied by words like "BAM" and "ZAP" appearing <em>in midair</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: In <em>Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon</em>, Malcolm Hulke's novelisation of "Colony in Space", it's mentioned in passing that a young woman had dyed her hair "dull blue, as was the fashion that month".</li></ul><hr>
