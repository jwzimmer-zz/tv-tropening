She leads an army of the Fomor, powerful water-dwelling magicians whose bizarre and twisted magics lend them immense power. Ethniu herself wields the nigh-unstoppable Eye of Balor, which smashed through one of Chicago's most heavily defended magical bases as if it was made of tinfoil. The only obstacle in her path is a loose alliance of disparate magical factions, several of whom care as little for humanity as Ethniu herself, and many of whom were at each other's throats mere days ago.</p><p>And one member of that alliance, of course, is Harry Dresden.</p><p>Dresden does have a couple of advantages, most notably two superweapons he smuggled out of Hades' vault. But even with those on his side, it will be a tall order indeed for Chicago's only wizard investigator to battle through Ethniu's endless legions and bring her down, especially since some of his strongest allies &mdash; the wizards of the White Council, including his own mentor Ebenezer McCoy &mdash; no longer fully trust him.

Harry, Maggie, the Carpenters, the Knights and a lot of other good people managed to make it out in one piece, the Eye of Balor has been sealed beneath Demonreach and Harry has his old lab back, though now with the BFS castle on top of it. Furthermore, Harry has convinced the supernatural community to start pursuing a better relationship with humanity, and is planning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">start his own supernatural nation</a> to help modernize the White Council's hidebound teachings into better and more effective methods. On the bitter side, Murphy, Hendricks, Wild Bill and Yoshimo are all dead, as are <em>60,000</em> other innocent people. Chandler is missing and presumed dead, and Wild Bill and Yoshimo were likely turned by the Black Court. Harry has been stripped of his status by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">White Council</a> and is once again facing a possible death sentence. And we find out that not only was Justine behind the assassination attempt on Etri, but she is possessed by Nemesis (who is actually another Walker, He Who Walks Beside), and the whereabouts of both her and Listen (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekick</a> of the Fomor forces during the invasion) are completely unknown. To cap things off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> is slowly yet certainly beginning to unravel (to the point where Marcone basically notes that while it still exists outside of Chicago, the citizens inside the city <em>will</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">take revenge on any supernatural creature that crosses their path</a> when the Sun goes down and will only pretend during the day that the supernatural doesn't exist), and there is no telling what repercussions this will have on both the supernatural and mortal worlds (though it's suggested that Harry's recommendations of reparations might at least help a bit). Oh, and Marcone is now a Denarian, having taken up Thorned Namshiel's Coin, though he's rogue and not working for Nicodemus (instead only working for himself).</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>:<ul><li> <strong>The Einherjaren</strong>.

It takes weeks to get basic infrastructure back up and running, and many more may have died if not for the mild, likely fae-influenced weather.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>:<ul><li> Many of the heavy hitters from the past sixteen books align to battle a Titan of unimaginable power, including many whom have been extremely hostile to each other beforehand.</li><li> Marcone actually points out this is biggest flaw in Ethniu's attack on the city &mdash; had she simply caused the blackout and caused a little chaos before leaving, she would have had front row seats to the city tearing itself apart in riots and looting.

This is technically true in that he doesn't know it's exact location (because he gave it to Demonreach to hide and ordered the ally not to tell Dresden where it was), and if everyone present then assumes Dresden doesn't possess it at all, that's their problem.

Carlos makes it clear that he blames Harry for Chandler's potential death, and Bill and Yoshimo's confirmed deaths, and all of the deaths and events of the past few days, largely because Harry didn't trust him.

He-Who-Walks-Beside</span>. It goes like this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just when Ethniu and the Fomor launched their attack, the Outsiders pressed their siege on the Outer Gates, meaning that if Mab tried to divert her troops from the Gates to Chicago, this could allow the Outsiders to break through, and if she didn't, she was forced to make do with minimal forces and in midsummer to boot, which is the lowest point of her power during the year. Even the result of the battle in Chicago was irrelevant for the Outsiders &mdash; if Ethniu and the Formor won, Winter and the Accorded Nations would fall, leaving nothing to stop them from breaking through the Gates, and if they lost, it would be at a great cost and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> would get exposed to irrefutable proof of the supernatural, making them afraid of the supernatural (which greatly serves the Outsiders' purposes). Even Harry himself was accounted for in this; if he died in the battle, it was one less Starborn and capable Winter Knight to worry about, and if he managed to survive, he was likely to be in no condition to see perhaps the ultimate case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">Kansas City Shuffle</a> in the series so far - tricking him into bringing Justine to Demonreach as his guest, allowing the Walker to use her as its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse">Trojan Horse</a> and pull off what they failed to do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays">Cold Days</a></em> and bring about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> by releasing Demonreach's inmates. This last part of the plan failed only because Harry didn't let his loss, emotional pain, and utter tiredness stop him from trying to understand the one piece of the puzzle that didn't fit the rest: why did Thomas attack the leader of the Svartalves all the way back to the first chapters of <em>Peace Talks</em>? This got even the Walker to lampshade that Harry doesn't look or sound as intelligent as he really is.</span></li><li> Marcone dumps one that Harry feared he had in mind for another one that he has one in the works. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Ethniu is sealed, the Eye washes up on the beach, between a battered, exhausted Harry and a relatively fresh Marcone. Harry is afraid that Marcone might simply murder him and take the Eye and the Spear of Destiny, but Marcone worked out the scenarios and decided that he would let Harry take the Eye and walk away. Harry doesn't know what he's planning, but Marcone simply answers that, while they will fight out their differences one day, he's learning the benefits of long term planning and time favors him. After this, Marcone credited Harry as the sole victor against Ethniu, implied to be, in part, preying on the White Council's fear of Harry to get him expelled, partly to keep the Eye out of the hands of the Council, and hurting Harry in the process didn't hurt.</span><ul><li> The immediate aftereffects comes back to bite him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry claims a right of reward from Marcone for defeating Enthiu and defending Marcone's city, essentially blackmailing Marcone in front of the other Accorded nations. Marcone tries to argue that Harry has the Eye, and that would serve as reward enough, but Harry had Alfred stash the Eye so that Harry could honestly say that he doesn't know where it is. Harry uses this to lay claim to Marcone's castle; though Marcone was furious, he couldn't say no to Harry without jeopardizing his hard-won rep to the other nations.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">You Shall Not Pass!</a>:<ul><li> Most of the book consists of a series of holding actions to defend Chicago and wear down Ethniu to the point where Harry can seal her away.</li><li> Harry and Murph go to evacuate a day-care center to find none other than Detective Bradley singlehandedly defending the door against a squad of Huntsmen with his service weapons. They break the siege for him and he escorts the evacuees to safety.</li><li> Harry uses the Winter Mantle to form a crowd of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a> volunteers and Winter Court warriors into an army, with which he inflicts grievous losses on the Fomorians in a defensive battle near the Bean. It also turns out after the fact that the heavily armed inhabitants of the South Side were a hornet's nest that the Fomorians shouldn't have poked: they almost singlehandedly destroyed an entire wing of the enemy army, freeing up Marcone's forces to join the main battle.</li><li> Harry explicitly invokes Gandalf's famous line when he and Butters destroy a bridge the Fomorian shock troops were using to sneak up on their forces. Tellingly, he uses the the movie version ("shall not"), rather than the original book one ("cannot"), since he is much more of a movie buff than a reader. Unfortunately, Butters is too busy demolishing the bridge to appreciate the reference.</li></ul></li></ul><hr>
