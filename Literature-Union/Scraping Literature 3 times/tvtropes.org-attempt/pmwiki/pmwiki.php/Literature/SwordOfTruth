It started in 1994 with the publishing of <em>Wizard's First Rule</em> and ended in 2007 with the eleventh in the series and final book of the <em>Chainfire</em> trilogy, <em>Confessor</em>. There is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> novella, originally published in the <em>Legends</em> compilation of short stories and now available on its own, called <em>Debt of Bones</em>.

After coming upon an "odd-looking vine", he spots a mysterious and beautiful woman who appears to be chased by four armed men. Offering to help her, he finds she is being trailed by assassins.<p>She explains that she has come in search of a great wizard, who supposedly came to Westland years ago, to help defend the Midlands against a man named Darken Rahl, who hopes to bring all the world under his dominion. Richard knows that what she says is impossible; nothing can get through the boundaries, and Westland doesn't have any magic. Yet he has never seen a woman like her, nor men like those hunting her. He decides he should take her to Zedd, a slightly crazy old man who is like a grandfather to him, and who always seems to know everything that goes on...</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>As you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist">might have guessed</a>, Zedd does, indeed, turn out to be the wizard, and the three characters team up to stop Darken Rahl before all is lost. Richard is given the titular Sword of Truth, which uses the power of its user's personal anger to strike down enemies.</p><p>The two first books, <em>Wizard's First Rule</em> and <em>Stone of Tears</em>, are fairly standard fantasy fare, complete with dragons, an evil wizard out to rule the world, the discovery that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">wasn't working for his own sake</a>, a potentially world-ending plot, a magic sword, a wise old wizard, a mysterious woman with strange powers, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">gratuitous S&amp;M sequence</a>. For a long time some people thought Goodkind was ripping off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Robert Jordan</a>, as his stories contained many things that had exact counterparts in Jordan's novels. From the third book on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerivativeDifferentiation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerivativeDifferentiation">things get slightly less derivative</a>, with the introduction of a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and increasing focus on Richard's struggles as a leader. By the fourth book the plot is still pretty standard but at least going under its own power.</p><p>Around the fifth book, Goodkind began introducing overtly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism">Objectivist</a> themes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">aesops</a> inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a> in the Sword of Truth. Things went overboard in the eighth book, <em>Naked Empire</em>, which contains the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">evil pacifist</a> plot. The last three books, collectively called the Chainfire Trilogy, brought back plenty of the early themes and events of the series, and <em>Confessor</em>, the last book, was specifically one huge throw-back to <em>Wizard's First Rule</em>.</p><p>Goodkind has stated a distaste for cliffhangers and other ways of forcing people to buy future books, which is why, aside from the Chainfire trilogy, the books have mostly self-contained plots; some new danger is introduced, the characters wonder about its meaning, and it is defeated. However, all of these book-plots are tied by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the Imperial Order</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Keeper of the Underworld</a>.</p><p>There's also a spin-off book, <em>The Law of Nines</em>, which follows a completely different cast of characters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">shifts genres</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">a contemporary thriller with fantasy elements</a>. It takes place in the magic-free world created at the end of "Confessor", the inhabitants of which developed technology to replace the magic they had lost. The story follows the exploits of Alex Rahl, a distant descendant of Richard's half-sister Jennsen, whose life is changed forever when he meets a woman named Jax who claims to be from a parallel universe where magic still works.</p><p>Now has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SwordOfTruth">character sheet</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This series provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceOfEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceOfEvidence">Absence of Evidence</a>: In <em>Chainfire</em>, after the eponymous spell has made everyone forget that Kahlan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">ever existed</a>, Richard tries to use this to convince everyone else that she has. He points to where he says he, Kahlan, and Cara had been walking, and notes that there were no footprints between his and Cara's, which were several feet apart. He tells his companions that this means someone erased Kahlan's footprints. Nobody believes him since, as mentioned, everyone is sure that she never existed in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Three examples occur in the series. Darken Rahl <em>kills</em> all of his children who he knew about, since none had magic (he wanted a gifted heir). Oba's mother does nothing but belittle him that we see, and this may be why he has an utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> (though his birth father Darken Rahl displays the same trait). Nicci's mother was entirely unsympathetic to her daughter's needs, and even hit her when Nicci came for comfort over being frightened by a beggar, saying she should accept this. She demanded utter self-denial and service to others from Nicci, which left her a self-loathing mess for years to come. This explains why she served the Keeper and then the Imperial Order, since both fed into this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAthlete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAthlete">Accidental Athlete</a>: Richard gets conscripted into a Ja'La team after he slaughters his way through a considerable number of soldiers in an almost-successful attempt to free himself.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>: The Bandakar initially, who fall under the rule of the Imperial Order due to this. Most of them later abandon pacifism and kill fight with Richard's guidance.

How the real-world names (with histories and etymologies that are incompatible at best with the fictional languages and cultures of the setting) ended up in this world is never addressed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: The D'Haran guards at the People's Palace during the first book. While they're there to guard Darken Rahl and, ostensibly, Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and Chase are the enemy, Darken Rahl believes they're no longer a threat to him, so the guards are just polite and friendly, even going so far as offering Richard a horse and giving him directions and advice on what road to take when he leaves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance">Age-Gap Romance</a>: Warren and Verna are actually both the same age, but due to Warren spending more time in a spell that slows aging, he looks much younger.

It's broken even before that, since Richard's explicit superpower is that things come to him without any effort (most obviously magic, but it's implied that everything from his skill with a bow to sculpture are just handed to him for free by the universe with no training, practice, etc. required).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherhoodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherhoodOfEvil">Brotherhood of Evil</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">gender flipped</a> example: the Sisters of the Dark in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth">The Sword of Truth</a></em>, an organization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">evil sorcerers</a> within the Sisters of the Light secretly serving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">the Keeper</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Brother&#150;Sister Incest</a>: Tobias and Lunetta Brogan apparently have an incestuous relationship, giving her saying she cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">glamours</a> for him in private.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Richard</span> in the last few books of the series... not that he ever really did much with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his magic</span> in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a>: This occurs in the books as well as the series, whenever Kahlan uses her power and in many of Richard's fights, accompanied by the recurring phrases "Time was hers" and "Bringer of death" respectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourDisabled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourDisabled">Bury Your Disabled</a>: When the Imperial Order conquers a city, it's shown they kill a mentally disabled man as he's deemed "useless" (they only keep citizens with useful skills alive as slaves).

They take "mates" from among men to reproduce. Yet this is never called rape, even though after that's done their mates can't refuse to consent. This is particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy">hypocritical</a> as the Confessors are in the "good" camp, while rape is ubiquitously used as a mark of their evil enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeSciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeSciFi">Double Standard: Rape, Sci-Fi</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged">Zigzagged</a> in the series.<ul><li> The glamour spell, the series' equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">love potions</a>, is seen by characters as tantamount to rape.

While that's all problematic enough, it crosses into rape territory because having sex causes them to lose control of their power, Confessing whoever they do it with. This means that there were only two recorded cases of a Confessor able to have a mate who <em>isn't</em> forced to consent with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind control</a>, and these cases were <em>3,000 years apart</em>. Bear in mind that Confessors are on the <em>good</em> side, and this isn't treated as rape.

This power is never used after the first book, even though it's not that far-fetched to imagine that it would be quite useful in a number of scenarios. However it was explicitly said to be a one-way change if the user only has additive magic. Though in theory, Richard could do it. Full-scale physical manipulation requires both sides of the power, which was one of the reasons the older Wizards sealed subtractive magic away, due to all the monstrosities created during the previous war by the unrestricted full use of magic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>: The Mord-Sith's "training."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a>: Additive and Subtractive magic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a>: By book 3, it becomes evident that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prelate Annalina</span> has been manipulating events <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> from before the protagonist was born.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility">Gender-Restricted Ability</a>: An enforced case in the series.<ul><li> There are only female Confessors, but not because males can't get the power. It's because when a male has the power, it's a much <em>stronger</em> version, without the cooldown that female confessors have, and because of this they end up using said power to get everything they want. After the first generation of tyrannical male Confessors was dealt with, all male Confessor babies are killed shortly after birth.</li><li> There's also differences between Wizard (male) magic power and Sorceress (female) magic power. In practical terms, they can do more or less the same things: throw wind, fire and lightning around, create spell forms, etc. But they're stated to work differently, such that each gender doesn't properly "get" how the other works. At the Palace of the Prophets, for example, it takes several hundred years for the sorceresses to teach young wizards how to use their gifts properly, but it takes a <em>much</em> shorter amount of time for a male wizard to teach another male wizard.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a>: From "stories with important human themes" to a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tracts</a> in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Objectivism</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic">Geometric Magic</a>: The books contain several examples.

It is stated that in the last case, even the smallest mistake cannot be corrected and means death. At least one wizard family lived in an entire palace built as a magical sign.

Verna also urges against it, due to her belief a child is a gift from the Creator. Du Chaillu concedes, and because they're married according to her people's custom, later considers the child to be also "his." Later Kahlan, having gotten pregnant by Richard, considers having an abortion due to having been told by a semi-reliable source that the child would be male, and the last time male Confessors were allowed to live past infancy they turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>; since then male Confessor children have always been killed at birth.
