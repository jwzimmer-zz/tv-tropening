Or a sort of waiting room of the afterlife. There, he meets Captain Collin "Jack" Murphy, Karrin Murphy's father, who is working to clean up supernatural messes that affect the post-living when something screws with their deaths.

Harry finds out that, much like everything else a ghost can do, it is powered by memory. Stuart makes a great effort to recover that energy each time it is used. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Harry finds out later that he can use magic again if it is powered by his memories of using magic. However, if Harry does not recover that energy (and there is no apparent way to do so, unlike Sir Stuart's bullets) he himself will eventually dissipate since, as a ghost, Harry is made of nothing ELSE but memory.

He walks down a busy street and cannot even strike up a conversation with a person passing by or flip the bird at a bad driver. He fears for what might become of his mind if he must endure this a year or even ten years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>: In payment for all his years serving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Mortimer's protector, Uriel recovers a damaged Sir Stuart and offers him a new job among his forces.

The Prince of Darkness himself will not wrest him from me. Neither will you, Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden, noble though your intentions may be."<ul><li> And it becomes doubly badass in universe &mdash; by using of all his names in the "right way," the angel is demonstrating she basically owns him.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>: Daniel Carpenter takes after both of his parents in the badass department, knife fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with a supernaturally fast warlock</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel">Archangel Uriel</a></span> reveals to Harry that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was unduly influenced by a Fallen saying a lie with seven words that led him to wanting to die after becoming the Winter Knight</span>.

The only way this could be allowed is if the power was no longer Stuart's, to which Harry equates him having to amputate part of himself. At first Harry thinks he just got a powerful gun with one shot to it, but later he comes to realize it is more than that. It is a symbol of power and authority over the protector spirits and the Lecter Specters.
