It tells the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who, on the death of their father, are forced to move (along with their mother and younger sister) into rather more straitened circumstances. The novel follows Elinor's quiet, restrained love affair with Edward Ferrars (her sister-in-law's brother who is expected to marry a rich woman) and Marianne's more overtly-romantic love triangle with the dashing Willoughby and the older, reliable Colonel Brandon.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The main theme of the novel is the contrast between reasonable Elinor's patience and sense of responsibility and Marianne's headstrong love of romance ("sensibility" in the language of the time), which often leads her into trouble.</p><p>The 1995 film cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaThompson">Emma Thompson</a> as Elinor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateWinslet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateWinslet">Kate Winslet</a> as Marianne; a 2008 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">BBC</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries">Mini Series</a> drew heavy inspiration from the film and is comparable in quality.

He is 35 and she is 17, and she generally thinks he's too old for any love or marriage. Her sister Elinor thinks that it is a significant gap, but says a woman of 27 and a man of 35 might be quite happy together. Near the end of the novel, the Colonel is still very much in love with her, and the narrator says he had "little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance">Age-Gap Romance</a>: Colonel Brandon, 35, falls in love with young Marianne Dashwood, 17. She thinks that he is extremely old, and barely considers him a family friend. When her mother starts supporting the relationship, she acknowledges the age difference, but thinks it might be a good thing that he's older and that his principles are steady and fixed.

When Mrs. Jennings asks for information about Elinor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, Margaret innocently obliges.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>:<ul><li> Edward is supposed to marry to Miss Morton &mdash; leave it to Jane Austen to make <em>men</em> victims of this trope. Miss Morton is a very wealthy daughter of a lord, and Edward's domineering mother wants him to marry her. Miss Morton is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a> and never actually appears in the story, so we never know what she thought of the match.</li><li> Colonel Brandon's "Eliza" was forced to marry his older brother. She was his orphaned cousin raised under the guardianship of Brandon's father, and very wealthy. The Brandon family estate was in debt, so they needed Eliza to marry the Colonel's eldest brother in order for her fortune to be used on the family estate. He didn't love her or deserve her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Benevolent Boss</a>: It's implied that the Dashwood women are regarded as this by their servants, since three of them immediately volunteer to accompany them into Devonshire; the narrative further remarks that when the women arrive safely at Barton Cottage, they are considerably cheered by how happy their servants are to see them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">Birds of a Feather</a>: Marianne desires a relationship like this. She hopes to find a most superior man with whom she could share all her passions, like music, literature and poetry.<div class="indent"><strong>Marianne:</strong>: Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.

After he and Marianne run into each other at a ball, she intercepts a letter from Marianne which confirms all of her suspicions, and orders him to write the cold breakup letter immediately - even going so far as to actually dictate it. (Of course, all this information comes from Willoughby explaining himself in an attempt to look better, so it should be taken with some salt.)<ul><li> Lucy behaves this way toward Elinor, as she is very much aware that Edward has feelings for the other girl. Elinor, however, is smart enough to recognize what Lucy is doing, and endeavors to act like she has no particular interest in Edward beyond as an extended relation through their siblings' marriage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Cloud Cuckoolander</a>: Mrs. Jennings seems to be one of these, and is described as "silly" on many a book jacket. It's true that she is a bit flighty and prone to speaking her mind without necessarily thinking first, but as the book continues, she also reveals herself to be smarter than the reader might have first believed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComfortFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComfortFood">Comfort Food</a>: Mrs. Jennings tries to treat Marianne's heartbreak by feeding her, but Marianne refuses almost everything.

There, the Dashwood sisters encounter Willoughby, who was previously avoiding them since their arrival in London. Willoughby's fianc&eacute;e also sees Marianne and it's strongly implied she's jealous of Marianne's great beauty and because of rumours about Willoughby's involvement with her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">The Dandy</a>: Robert Ferrars is depicted this way when he first appears, although Elinor doesn't know who he is at the moment. He spends a ridiculous amount of time fussing over a custom toothpick case, and when he looks at her and Marianne, she thinks that he seems to be expecting them to admire him rather than the other way around. He doesn't improve upon proper introduction.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>: Colonel Brandon.

And I protest, if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. (...) Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake. (...) So that, in fact, you see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Narration:</strong> Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouThinkICantFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouThinkICantFeel">Did You Think I Can't Feel?</a>: Elinor acts mostly reserved and she seems rather cold to her mother and sister who feel everything very deeply and feel they must show their emotions to everybody. Then Elinor reveals at the end what she had to go through (she loved a good man who loved her back, but promised to marry another one, who was not worthy of him) and that she had to suffer silently because of her promise.<div class="indent"><strong>Elinor:</strong> If you can think me capable of ever feeling &mdash; surely you may suppose that I have suffered now.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>: Mrs. Palmer and Anne Steele both fall into this.

Needless to say, when he <em>does</em> officially leave her...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>: Elinor. She's only nineteen, yet mature enough to control her emotions and not to showcase them, unlike her less rational mother and sister Marianne. After her father Mr. Dashwood dies, she's the most reliable member of the family and a great support to all if a problem arises. She's the kind of Emotionless Girl with a (now rather common) twist &mdash; she feels emotions, and rather deeply, too, but doesn't express them openly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVsStoicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVsStoicism">Emotions vs. Stoicism</a>: Both themes are presented in the title and in the personalities of Marianne and Elinor. Elinor represents "sense," which then meant what it does now - having a good head on your shoulders and not letting your feelings carry you away. Marianne represents "sensibility", which meant more of a strength of feeling or something akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Romanticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. Austen's sympathies are not clearly on either side; Marianne's strong sensibility is tested throughout the novel and her romantic, self-indulgent ways almost kill her, and she is eventually forced to learn to be more like her rational sister. Elinor, meanwhile, has to reconcile her private feelings and the way she acts, for example admitting her inner pain to her family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpistolaryNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpistolaryNovel">Epistolary Novel</a>: Early drafts were written in a letter form, under the title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NameAndName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NameAndName">Elinor and Marianne</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>: When Fanny Dashwood notices her mother, Mrs. Ferrars, sneering at Elinor's artwork, Fanny ventures to compliment it.

Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to have him. Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round. But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.</div></li><li> Lucy Steele. As a very young man, Edward Ferrars became secretly engaged to her. Even though he doesn't love her anymore, he can't honourably break off the engagement.

It takes near-death to smarten her up.

He's a gentleman (and a scoundrel) of a landed gentry with a mansion house called Combe Magna, and he will inherit another house from his elderly childless cousin. However, he lives extravagantly and is deeply in debt. Miss Grey has a dowry of fifty thousand pounds, which makes her the wealthiest heiress in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>'s 'verse. Her feelings for him are not entirely clear, but he is a fashionable, handsome man, and she wants to get married so she can part with her guardians with whom she didn't get along. Willoughby claims he loves Marianne Dashwood, who is lovely, intelligent, passionate, but poor as a church mouse, and Miss Grey, being rather plain, is understandably jealous; however, it's unclear how true that is, since Willoughby's account is the only one the reader is given and he's not the most honest guy.

Even Elinor admits to herself that, even though they're wrong, she can understand where they get the idea.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a>: In the end, Elinor finally breaks down and expresses the emotion she's been bottling up all throughout the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDialogueTwoConversations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDialogueTwoConversations">One Dialogue, Two Conversations</a>: Colonel Brandon approaches Elinor with a proposition &mdash; since Edward, freshly disinherited for being engaged to Lucy, needs to make a living, the Colonel wants to offer him the position of rector in his home parish, and would like Elinor to act as intermediary since the men have never met. Mrs. Jennings misunderstands what little she overhears, and thinks that the Colonel has proposed marriage to Elinor. Several pages later, the discrepancy is clarified, and both women are considerably amused by it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNounAndTheNoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNounAndTheNoun">The Noun and the Noun</a>: "Sense and Sensibility"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">Nouveau Riche</a>: Lady Middleton's obsession with well-bred behavior and exasperation with her mother and sister's manners implies this. (She's equally exasperated with her titled husband's lack of breeding when they visit London and he maintains his usual habit of impromptu social gatherings, which is Not Done in town.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker">The Oath-Breaker</a>: Lucy's jilting her fianc&eacute; is treated with all the gravity with which the era would regard it, even though Edward wants out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>: Marianne seems, through much of the story, like she's deliberately ignoring Colonel Brandon's undeclared love for her. On literally the second-to-last page, it's finally clarified that <em>she honestly had no idea</em>, and is stunned when she realizes it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneThatGotAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneThatGotAway">The One That Got Away</a>: In the epilogue, it's said that Willoughby's reaction to whatever young lady is being talked up as a great beauty is to say that she is nothing to Mrs. (Marianne) Brandon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Averted with John Willoughby, Mr. John Dashwood, and Sir John Middleton. However, Willoughby is normally called by his last name, and Sir John has the honorific to set him apart. Sir John also has a son named John, but he's only identified by name once in the whole book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>: Elinor has the most "sense" of any of the characters, most of whom are foolish, selfish or downright debased. She's particularly exasperated by the romantic drama revolving around her sister.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">Parental Favoritism</a>:<ul><li> It's clear that Marianne is her mother's favorite child; it's even explained in an early chapter that Mrs. Dashwood dotes on her because of her three daughters, Marianne is the most like herself.</li><li> It's also implied that Mrs. Jennings favors Mrs. Palmer over Lady Middleton, for the same reason.</li><li> Mrs. Ferrars clearly favors both Robert (her youngest) and Fanny (her only daughter) over Edward. Later, she even favors <em>Lucy</em>, Robert's wife, over Elinor, who marries Edward &mdash; despite the fact that Lucy was the reason she disinherited Edward in the first place!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a>:<ul><li> In the personal history he imparts to Elinor, Colonel Brandon and his childhood sweetheart Elizabeth were forcibly separated.</li><li> Later, Edward's refusal to break off his engagement to Lucy causes his mother to disown him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">Parents as People</a>: Mrs. Dashwood is a kind and loving but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">fallible</a> character. By the end of the book, she's come to recognize that her own attitude toward things has contributed toward Marianne's disappointment. She also realizes that she let herself be blinded by Elinor's consideration and stoic nature, and fears that she's been unkind to her elder daughter by not taking notice of her pain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassedOverInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassedOverInheritance">Passed-Over Inheritance</a>: Mr. Dashwood effectively gets hit with this at the beginning of the book; his elderly uncle leaves the bulk of his estate not to Mr. Dashwood, but to his son John, because during his final illness the uncle became deeply attached to John's little boy Henry. John had already inherited everything of his mother's, so he was comfortably settled in the first place, and Mr. Dashwood intends to use his time as the master of Norland to set aside money for his wife and daughters. Unfortunately, he dies less than a year after his uncle, so all he can leave them is what he himself owned, which is very little compared to the Norland estate.<ul><li> By extension, the three Dashwood girls are this due to the uncle favoring their half-brother and his child, even though they need the money much more than John and little Henry do. The girls helped to nurse the uncle through his final illness, so he leaves them one thousand pounds each out of gratitude and affection, and the interest they earn from this "competence" is their chief source of income. For this reason, the invitation to live at Barton Cottage (where they barely have to pay rent and are often sent gifts of food by their mother's cousin Sir John) is a tremendous relief to their circumstances.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Perpetual Poverty</a>: The Dashwoods aren't exactly destitute (they have servants), but the situation in which they find themselves after Mr. Dashwood's death is certainly a massive step down for them socially.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">Plot-Triggering Death</a>: Mr. Dashwood's death is what forces his wife and daughters to seek a new home.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">The Pollyanna</a>: Mrs. Palmer is always ready to smile and laugh at everything. Her reaction to her husband's continual insults is simply to laugh and declare that he's extremely droll.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a>: It's implied that Marianne is this for Colonel Brandon, given her strong resemblance in both looks and temperament to his childhood sweetheart, Eliza.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>:<ul><li> Fanny Ferrars comes from a very wealthy genteel family and marries John Dashwood who is also wealthy (his mother left him a large sum of money), and when his father Mr. Henry Dashwood dies, they come into possession of Norland, their family estate. Fanny is obsessed with money and she's a cold person.</li><li> Lady Middleton is an icy woman of high rank in society. She's very beautiful, tall, striking, graceful, elegant, well-bred, but also cold and reserved, and has absolutely nothing interesting to say. She tolerates the Miss Steeles because they are willing to suck up to her, and she's rather delighted with Fanny Dashwood, who likewise thinks she is "one of the most charming women in the world." It's their mutual coldness that attracts them to pursue a friendship with one another.</li><li> Willoughby indicates that his wife Sophia is a haughty, unpleasant Rich Bitch, although the reader gets no direct confirmation because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">she's never seen</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment">Romanticism Versus Enlightenment</a>: Essentially the point of the novel &mdash; Elinor and Austen alike both fall on the side of enlightenment, whereas Marianne is on the side of romanticism (the "cult of sensibility" of which she is a member was basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Romanticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Romanticism">Romanticism</a> in its early stages).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Sarcasm Mode</a>: Austen's description of the "kindness" John Dashwood intends to show his half-sisters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">Screw the Money, I Have Rules!</a>: Edward's mother attempts to basically bribe him with a massive advance on his inheritance if he will only break his engagement to Lucy Steele and marry the woman she's picked out for him. We don't know how tempted he is to accept, but he refuses to go back on his word and is promptly disinherited for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove">Second Love</a>: Discussed at a few points, as Marianne (in early chapters) adamantly refuses to believe that it's possible to fall in love more than once. Elinor is quite wry about it when she and Colonel Brandon talk about this opinion, since - as she points out - their mother was their father's second wife. Marianne's opinion is ultimately turned on its head by the end of the book; she and Colonel Brandon are each other's second loves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a>: Elinor keeps getting drafted into this role. She's quite willing to keep the secret of her good friend Colonel Brandon's ill-fated first love and what became of her daughter. She's less enthusiastic about being the one in whom Lucy confides about the state of her engagement to Edward, since that's the man Elinor herself loves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Secret Relationship</a>: Edward and Lucy swore themselves to each other as a youthful fancy and kept it secret. Edward regrets it and wishes that it would never come to light.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">Separated by a Common Language</a>: Being "sensible" had a different meaning in Austen's time than it does now; sensibility in those days referred to an affection for things wild and untamed in nature. Nowadays, sense and sensibility mean pretty much the same thing. If the novel were written today it would probably be called <em>Sense and Sensitivity.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettleForSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettleForSibling">Settle for Sibling</a>: Mrs. Ferrars plans on this after she disinherits Edward, as John explains to Elinor. Since Miss Morton cannot now marry Edward, she plans to arrange an engagement between the lady and Robert, her younger son, now the heir to both his own and Edward's share of the Ferrars estate. This does not work out in her favor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">She Is Not My Girlfriend</a>: Elinor, who usually ignores the various conjectures and hints everybody makes about her love life, at one point finds herself obliged to tell her brother that no, she is not going to marry Colonel Brandon. John completely ignores her. He knows better, obviously.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>: At one point half the cast seems to ship Elinor and Colonel Brandon. Elinor and Brandon... don't share their opinion, although Elinor at least can see where they get the idea. She even admits to herself that if she didn't already know he's in love with Marianne, she would be persuaded to think he really does have a thing for her because they have such a great friendship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">Sibling Yin-Yang</a>:<ul><li> Elinor and Marianne, whose dichotomy provide the novel's title. Elinor has sense, making her cool, level-headed and rational. Marianne has sensibility, making her sensitive, passionate and impulsive.</li><li> The narrative states that Mrs. Palmer is several years younger than her sister, Lady Middleton, and "totally unlike her in every respect". Lady Middleton is perfectly civil, haughty and icy, while Mrs. Palmer is kind-hearted and open almost to a fault.</li><li> Edward Ferrars is about as unlike his brother and sister as it's possible to be. He's kind, generous, and possesses great humility, while they're braggarts and social climbers who are obsessed with money and look down at others.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a>: One-sided. Anne Steele, Lucy's sister, acts this way about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, a man called Doctor Davies. She begins any conversation regarding the man by assuming that whoever is talking to her will tease her about him; the narrative observes that she affects a simpering tone. (According to what Austen told her nieces and nephews, she doesn't get him, but the book doesn't indicate one way or the other.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan">Single Woman Seeks Good Man</a>: Elinor and Marianne are both young ladies on the market for a husband. Their diminished financial situation makes them rather reliant on finding a good man to support them.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a>: Lady Middleton's children. They're overindulged and uncontrollable, and the reasons are illustrated in one scene where Annamaria scratches herself on a pin and starts crying; her mother and the Miss Steeles immediately begin pampering her, coddling her, and giving her sweets, which she perceives as a reward for her bawling.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">Spot of Tea</a>: Elinor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSolvingHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSolvingHammer">solution to everything</a>. It's surprising she didn't think to throw a scalding hot cup of tea on Lucy's head.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Stiff Upper Lip</a>:<ul><li> Elinor has a moment in the end where she states that just because she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> doesn't mean that she isn't <em>feeling</em> great passions. She just keeps them appropriately restrained and soldiers on.</li><li> Colonel Brandon is deeply in love with Marianne, but understands that he's not even on her radar and does not let bitterness or jealousy affect his principled actions. It works out in the end.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>: Elinor, who suffers in silence when her beloved must leave her for another woman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StronglyWordedLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StronglyWordedLetter">Strongly Worded Letter</a>: Elinor is unwilling to ask Marianne if she is engaged to Willoughby, fearing that her interference will be rejected. She decides that if things continue thus, she will write to her mother and "represent in the strongest manner [...] the necessity of some serious inquiry into the affair." (When she finally does make this plea, Mrs. Dashwood largely ignores it and only asks Marianne to be more open with them.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCareOfTheKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCareOfTheKids">Take Care of the Kids</a>:<ul><li> John Dashwood promises his dying father that he will take care of his sister... but doesn't.</li><li> Part of Colonel Brandon's backstory: When his cousin/first love Elizabeth dies, she bequeaths her daughter to him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkAboutTheWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkAboutTheWeather">Talk About the Weather</a>: Everyone except Marianne, who complains about this. Elinor, on the other hand, is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">answer questions about the weather before they are asked</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">Triang Relations</a>:<ul><li> Elinor and Lucy both love Edward; Edward used to love Lucy, wants to stay constant, but falls in love with Elinor.</li><li> Brandon and Willoughby both love Marianne. Marianne loves Willoughby, but he leaves her, and at the end she marries Brandon.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnableToSupportAWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnableToSupportAWife">Unable to Support a Wife</a>: Edward's position at the end when his mother disowns him. Brandon is able to offer him a parsonage on his land as Edward wants to be a clergyman, but he thinks it will only be enough income for a bachelor. Edward at the end reconciles with his mother and receives some money, so he's able to marry at last.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a>: Fanny Dashwood. The woman is a work of art. First she talks her husband out of fulfilling his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest">Last Request</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCareOfTheKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCareOfTheKids">Take Care of the Kids</a>. Then she treats them with all sorts of coldness and contempt because they're living in what is now her house. Then she resents them for taking their own staff with them when they move out. She even resents the fact that they take <em>their own belongings</em> with them!</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: Fanny pulls an excellent one. Miss Steele reveals Lucy's engagement. Fanny falls into violent hysterics and kicks them out of the house. Her husband's comment: "She has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel! She says she shall never think well of anybody again."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst">Wrong Guy First</a>:<ul><li> Marianne first falls for Willoughby, but she discovers some dark secrets of his that prove he's not worth her affection.</li><li> Edward foolishly proposed to another woman in a childhood fancy, only to regret it later.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>Adaptations with their own trope pages include:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SenseAndSensibility">The 1971, 1981 and 2008 TV miniseries</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SenseAndSensibility">The 1995 film</a></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibilityAndSeaMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibilityAndSeaMonsters">Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters</a></em></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MatchesAndMatrimony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MatchesAndMatrimony">Matches and Matrimony</a></em>, a PC game which is a composite adaptation of three Austen novels, including <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</li></ul>
