Technology has made numerous advancements (including the ever-popular flying cars) and humans have established colonies and commercial facilities in space; prostitution has been legalized and regulated, while guns and unrecycled paper products have been banned and vegetable/soy substitutes for environmentally touchy products like meat and coffee are widespread.

He's forgetful about details - "vague" and "dreamy" are recurring descriptors - but his wife notes that he is "skilled at fining down a point to its most elemental level," and she often discusses aspects of cases with him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>:<ul><li> In the backstory of both main characters, with the sole exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Roarke's real mother, who died soon after he was born.</span></li><li> Also applies to Mavis's abusive mother.</li><li> Several criminals in the novels have been abused by their parent(s).

The drug leaves them in a perpetually vague, befuddled state of mind with limited capacity for retaining detailed information. Combined with the tendency of the drug to also wreak havoc on one's eyesight, this makes them supremely frustrating witnesses.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjectiveAnimalAlehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjectiveAnimalAlehouse">Adjective Animal Alehouse</a>: The Blue Squirrel, where the food and drinks are highly suspect and the live music acts tend to the scantily-clad. Mavis is employed there as a performer in the first three books, and Eve continues to use the location as a meeting place on occasion even after Mavis stops working there (though she prefers the Down and Dirty, the even seedier dive where Crack works as a bouncer, for covert meetings).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a>: Charles Monroe calls Eve "Lieutenant Sugar," and keeps it up long after any pretense of flirtation has passed. Roarke prefers "darling Eve," and at one point programs the house computer to call her that as well, to Eve's exasperation. McNabb has "She-Body" for Peabody, and Mavis doles out excessively cute nicknames like candy. Crack has "skinny white girl" for Eve, while she calls him "Big (or Large) Black Man"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">Agent Scully</a>: Eve flatly does not or refuses to believe in ghosts and the supernatural, even when it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">staring her straight in the face.</a> This vexes everyone around her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a>: Eve drives a string of them which she is secretly attached to, before Roarke insists on buying her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageProofVehicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageProofVehicle">Damage-Proof Vehicle</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>: Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">victims</a>, sometimes murderers.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>: They have this facade before revealing their true colors.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">Always Murder</a>: Justified.

He was caught prior to the start of the series; his case comes onto Eve's radar when it turns out that his son is involved in her current case. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The son, Charles "Chas" Forte, is being set up as a suspect by the real killers.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>: <em>Naked in Death</em> perpetuates the myth made popular by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em> in a crime anecdote that Feeney relates to Eve, involving a sex offender and murderer who coated his victims head to foot with red paint which suffocated them to death. "Skin's gotta breathe," Feeney explains. In reality, while it certainly wouldn't be <em>healthy</em> for someone to have their skin coated with paint, it wouldn't kill them - certainly not by suffocation, and the police report that Feeney was reading should have provided reasonably accurate information about cause of death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>: There are a lot of these. Eve starts out essentially forcing herself to sympathize with them and feel for them, an attitude which lessens as the series goes on thanks to several cases in which the victims turned out to <em>really</em> have it coming.<ul><li> <em>Witness in Death</em> has her openly admit that she couldn't feel sorry for the victim, nor truly condemn his murderer. Richard Draco is characterized right out of the gate as a petty and thoroughly unlikable prima donna who is roundly detested by everyone who knew him; scratching the surface reveals that he was also a sexual predator who routinely drugged women and filmed himself having sex with them without their knowledge or consent. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Including his own daughter, who was unaware of their familial connection when she started sleeping with him. Draco, on the other hand, was not only fully aware, he began the relationship <em>after learning the familial connection</em>.</span></li><li> <em>Thankless in Death</em> has Joe Klein, aka Asshole Joe, a smarmy, snarky insurance salesman who hits on Peabody, ignores Eve's advice, and adamantly refuses to believe that one of his old buddies is an over-the-edge insane killer out to get him even when all evidence proves that he is. By the end of the book, he is kidnapped by said killer friend and tortured to the point of pissing himself. When Eve finally rescues him, he's sobbing and apologizing for not listening.</li><li> The initial victim in <em>Brotherhood in Death</em> is portrayed right off the bat as a smug, wholly self-centered politician who cares more about money than about keeping a promise made to his late grandfather and is trying to pressure his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> cousin into selling their grandparents' house against the grandfather's final wishes. The investigation eventually reveals even worse: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all three of the murder victims, along with three other men, had formed a "Brotherhood" with a yearly tradition of abducting, drugging, and gang-raping young women.

"Traditional" firearms are banned, the food industry is more tightly regulated to the point that animal cruelty is virtually unheard of, welfare is better than ever, and prostitution and certain recreational drugs are legalized and regulated. On the other hand, none of this comes without cost: the regulation of the food industry and increased environmental protections mean that meats and animal products are all but entirely replaced by soy and vegetable substitutes for most people; real meat, real coffee, and real tobacco are rare and expensive luxuries, personal freedoms are more restricted and monitored, and projectile-based firearms have been antiquated and rendered obsolete anyways thanks to the invention of energy-based blasters, which can be and are just as lethal as any slugthrower when dialed up to the right settings. And even with all of this, people are still murdered by psychopaths, terrorists still blow up monuments, and there is still a dark, nasty underbelly to society where the forgotten and out-of-luck citizens waste away from the world. Basically, despite all the "progressive" changes to the world, its still the same world that it is now and nowhere near the utopia that it is supposed to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>: In <em>Possession in Death</em> Eve gets possessed by a dead gypsy who wants Eve to find her lost granddaughter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Depraved Bisexual</a>: Selina Cross in <em>Ceremony in Death</em> comes to mind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">sacrifices little children to the devil</a>, raped countless curious onlookers in her Satanist Club, drove a girl to suicide by stalking her with robotic pets and need we mention she's a Satanic drug dealer?</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairGambit">Despair Gambit</a>: Used in Conspiracy in Death on Eve to get her off a case. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It almost works.

And if it's not, chances are he considered buying it at one point or other.

(Despite the fact that personal involvement with a key figure in the case <em>should</em> cause Eve to be removed from the investigation due to conflict of interest, somehow this never happens.)<ul><li> In several books, the killer makes it personal by targeting Eve herself, Roarke, or both of them. <em>Vengeance,</em> <em>Betrayal,</em> and <em>Imitation in Death</em> provide some examples; similarly, in <em>Midnight in Death</em> and <em>New York to Dallas,</em> the killer is someone Eve previously caught who is now loose again. In <em>Conspiracy in Death,</em> Eve is framed for murder and for once actually <em>is</em> (temporarily) taken off the case.</li><li> The entire police department takes it personally any time one of their own is killed, hurt, or threatened, such as in <em>Ceremony,</em> <em>Judgement,</em> <em>Promises,</em> and <em>Apprentice in Death.</em> In <em>Purity in Death</em> the villains inspire a special kind of rage in Eve by managing to, in quick succession, endanger and hurt McNabb, Feeney, Peabody, and Trueheart, who is also forced to make his first kill. Likewise, the corrupt cops in <em>Treachery in Death</em> would already have personally offended Eve thanks to her near-reverential respect for the job and how much she defines herself by her work, but on top of that they scare Peabody half to death when she accidentally witnesses a conversation about their crimes. By the end of the book, Eve is basically trying to dig the deepest possible hole to toss their ringleader into.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">Jekyll &amp; Hyde</a>: Played straight in <em>Chaos in Death</em>, and good for a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>:<ul><li> Eve is blunt, prickly, and confrontational toward most people. Her relationships with no few of her friends and colleagues are characterized by snark and bickering, and she takes opportunities to threaten or insult suspects and unhelpful witnesses with unabashed glee. At the same time, she feels a very personal responsibility to see justice done for the victims in her cases, and takes pains to be gentle (if awkward) with people who are suffering. Her belligerence is mostly dished out to people who can take and give it back or who have earned it by being jerks themselves, and she's a loyal and protective friend to the people who have come to matter to her.</li><li> Aside from Eve, there's Chief Technician Dickie "Dickhead" Berenski in the NYPSD crime lab.

The idea that justice may be more important than the law isn't too bad itself... but Eve always seems to be the judge of what's justice. Past book thirty or so, she goes from bending the law when it's absolutely necessary to breaking it at will. If she weren't generally presented as unfailingly right, it would almost look like a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a>.</li><li> Oh...let's be honest. This trope has been present since the very first book of this series. For Eve, Roarke is this trope. <em>Vengeance in Death</em> had Eve finding out about some very serious crimes, however justified, committed by her husband. She had to choose between the law or her husband. Take a wild guess on which one she picked. Then there was <em>Creation in Death</em>, which had Eve finding out from the killer that he prepared documents a long time ago that will legally allow him to commit suicide. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She has Roarke erase the documents, and states quite clearly to him that she is crossing the line</span>. Of course, the book goes out of its way to show that the killer was an evil, cowardly man who would rather kill himself painlessly than face the consequences of both his actions and his failing health, so little sympathy for him is found in this case. If it is any consolation, Eve discusses her actions with Roarke in <em>Salvation in Death,</em> and concludes that this is <em>not</em> something she wants to make a regular habit of doing.</li><li> Even outside of extreme measures, Eve's normal methods of operating are those generally considered to be some of the worst aspects of law enforcement officers who abuse their authority. She threatens people to obtain information rather than pursue a more ethical and legal option, frequently coerces people into cooperating by threatening to arrest them on trumped-up or minor charges (frequently referred to as being arrested for "contempt of cop" by watchdog organizations), and has more than once physically assaulted someone secure in the knowledge that she can get away with it because of her position. While she often makes a show of being strictly by-the-book to avoid having a conviction thrown out (or herself being disciplined), her repeated violation of both the letter and the spirit of various laws shows that it's purely for the sake of getting her own way, not because she actually believes in it as she consistently claims to. Meaning that while Eve may not be a corrupt cop, that she's a <em>bad</em> one is hard to argue.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: Some have been proven scientifically by the time of the series, and possessors thereof are registered with the state.

The series itself doesn't really take Dallas' side, though.

They tend to malfunction whenever she attempts to use one. It's so bad that she habitually has someone else put her money in for her and press the button whenever she wants to buy something from one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>: Some murderers are subjected to this when Even foils them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousMotherSonDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousMotherSonDuo">Villainous Mother-Son Duo</a>: Madeline Bullock, the main antagonist of <em>Born In Death</em>, is a particularly nasty version.

She's likewise been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest">sexually abusing</a> Chase since his childhood.

This is both for protection, since Eve often has to park her vehicle in seedy areas where an obviously expensive car would be a magnet for theft and vandalism, and so as not to draw resentment from other cops who would see driving a flashy vehicle as an indication that Eve was more interested in personal appearances than her job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: When Crack returns from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> stint, Eve asks him to help her with some undercover work. His attempts and the results of such have yet to be mentioned.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>: Droids are a bit of a muddy area, here. While no one outright says they're sentient, and it's mostly implied that they're just well-programmed to emulate some emotional responses, they do display traits like fear and self-preservation... usually when Eve threatens to have them taken apart or destroyed for not being as cooperative as she'd like.<ul><li> <em>Obsession In Death</em> takes this a step further by introducing droid <em>police officers.</em> Called "D-Officers," they appear to be utilized as first-response officers in places where it would be difficult or dangerous for human officers to arrive in a timely fashion. Along with being made to look distinctively like human beings, they act mostly like humans as well, going by given names and even managing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">look somewhat amused</a> when Eve makes a lewd and unfriendly bystander talk by utilizing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">very unfriendly grip</a> on him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: "Isn't it funny how no one likes a dirty cop, but nobody wants to hang out with the guys that catch them?" Eve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">promptly ignores</a> this utterly apt and pointed observation from her former friend and continues to refer to Internal Affairs as the "rat squad".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole">Who Murdered the Asshole?</a>: Several cases have a wealth of suspects thanks to the victim being a terrible, or at least thoroughly unlikable, person (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>).<ul><li> One textbook example is Richard Draco in <em>Witness in Death,</em> who proves to have been such scum while he was alive that Eve for the first time in the series admits that she can't feel any sympathy for him nor condemn his murderer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">considering that she killed him for starting an exploitative sexual relationship with their unwitting daughter</span>. Agatha Christie references abound.</li><li> Another standout is Larinda Mars in <em>Secrets in Death</em>, a celebrity gossip reporter with no personal or professional ethics to speak of. She's quickly revealed to have been a blackmailer who excelled at digging up traumatic events from the past to hold over her victims - or outright manufacturing scandals to hold over them. Between the long list of her victims and the even longer list of their family and loved ones, Eve has a multitude of motivated suspects to try to sort through.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>:<ul><li> Eve has a severe fear of heights. Only her iron discipline keeps her from externalizing her strong internal reaction. She also has a fear of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cows,</span> but it's not as violent. Both of these are symptomatic of a general case of semi-agoraphobia, derived from living in large cities all her (remembered) life.</li><li> Both shrink as to nothing compared to her fear and loathing of anything even vaguely resembling a hospital. In fact, no matter how injured or fatigued she is the only way to get her to submit to treatment is if she's unconscious and/or physically restrained. It verges on the masochistic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Given one of Eve&#146;s first memories after murdering her hideously abusive father is waking up in a hospital and being asked questions by doctors and police she simply can&#146;t answer, &#147;who are you, where are your parents, etc,&#148; this is kind of understandable.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>: <em>Holiday In Death</em> and <em>Portrait In Death</em> have killers who could be considered this. Those killers suffered losses that was the end of the world for them. They turned to murder because for them, it's the only way to unleash the pain. Those killers are also implied to have been born with untreated mental disorders. Perhaps they are unsympathetic, but it can be agreed that they are pathetic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>: The Urban Wars, a period of very violent worldwide civil unrest. Roarke mentions that it ran longer in Ireland than most places.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">You Didn't Ask</a>: In <em>Naked in Death</em>, Roarke mentions that DeBlass used to buy guns from the black market. When Eve asks why he didn't tell her before, he says she didn't ask.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNOTWantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNOTWantToKnow">You Do NOT Want To Know</a>: In <em>Vengeance in Death</em>, Eve asks what's in the "meat stuff" she's eating (actually blood pudding). Roarke says, "You&#146;ll thank me for not telling you. Just enjoy it."</li></ul><hr>
