Most of Charis' previous kings were part of the plan. Upon revealing themselves to Merlin and Cayleb, they become a check-and-balance for the Inner Circle, vetting new candidates to be inducted.</li><li> <em>Hell's Foundations Quiver</em> introduces the Sisterhood of Saint Kohdy, led by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aivah Pahrsahn</span>. They've been active much longer than the Brotherhood, but the source of their knowledge is a journal left behind by one of the original <em>seijins</em>, who had only begun to suspect what had been done, so they lacked the full knowledge of Safehold's past that the Brotherhood possessed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMutiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMutiny">Anti-Mutiny</a>: Shan-wei's goal before Langhorne killed her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>:<ul><li> Vicar Rhobair Duchairn starts becoming this early in <em>By Schism Rent Asunder</em> after he starts to rediscover his faith.

The only reason he's not moving openly against the other members of the Group of Four now is that he knows he wouldn't accomplish anything but becoming one more victim of the Inquisition without building a new political power base.

The same also goes for Charis &#151; there's no way they could have survived this long if they hadn't been planning their heretical rebellion for years.

Each nation also has a rivalry between the infantry and cavalry, and different doctrine as to how each should be used, which doesn't help.

By <em>Midst Toil and Tribulation</em>, it has come full circle in that Earl Thirsk and his officers are actually starting to come up with new and innovative warship and weapon designs instead of just copying Charisian tech. Merlin has mixed feelings about this, as on the one hand, this development supports his long-term goal of destroying Safehold's technophobia, but on the other hand, it's going to make winning the war more difficult for Charis.</li><li> Gets even more pronounced in <em>Like a Mighty Army</em>, when Earl Thirsk and Captain General Maigwair's men come up with a breech-loading rifle design they can mass-produce that is even better than the ones Charis has issued to its army. Thankfully for Charis, they quickly counter with the magazine-loading lever-action rifle.</li><li> As an overall point of reference, at the start of book one, the height of naval technology is the oar-powered galley, with naval actions generally decided by boarding. Nine years later, the final naval action of the Jihad features a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-dreadnought_battleship">pre-dreadnaught battleship<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and a half-dozen <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_cruiser">armored cruisers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> taking on coastal defenses that are <em>almost</em> sufficient to stop them. On land, the rate of progress is similar: at the beginning, the matchlock arquebus is slowly displacing the crossbow as a projectile weapon, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_and_shot">pike and shot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is the premier infantry formation, and cavalry is a major (and prestigious) part of most armies. The final land battles of the Jihad would not have looked out of place on the eastern front of World War I.</li><li> The <em>King Haarahld</em> class of warship is intended to be the pinnacle of this. It's noted with only mild exaggeration that a single <em>King Haarahld</em> is more powerful than every other ship on Safehold <em>combined</em>. However, it is blatantly overkill for what remains of the enemy naval forces by <em>At the Sign of Triumph</em>, when one is finally used, and the resources for one could be used to build ten of the lesser but still blatantly overpowered <em>City</em> class ships. It's explained that the awesome outweighs the impractical, because the <em>true</em> intent behind the <em>King Haarahld</em> is to make everyone else need one, or something like it, yet actually building one requires fully embracing the techniques and technology Charis has introduced, making it a potential death knell for the Proscriptions of Jwo-jeng.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingRelic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingRelic">Living Relic</a>: For a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">given value of "living"</a>, Merlin and Owl are both relics of Terran Federation and humanity's high-tech SF past, and their aim is to bring this past back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>:<ul><li> When your list of characters by the second book takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">ten pages</a>, you know you've hit this.</li><li> As of the sixth book, the character list now occupies <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">forty-one</a></em> pages.</li><li> In book seven, it takes up pages 585 through 651 &#151; that's 66 pages.

The Charisians have done their best to restrict their propaganda to provable facts, regardless of whether anyone will believe them or not. On at least two occasions (Ahnzhelyk's files regarding Church corruption and the murders of vicars within Zion itself), Charisian leadership chose not to publish anything because they only have copies and not the original evidence (in the case of the former) and because there's an off-chance of Clyntahn's pulling a fast one and can disprove their claims (in the case of the latter).</li><li> In <em>At the Sign of Triumph</em>, this becomes crucial when the propaganda broadsheets Owl's remotes tack up all over the Temple Lands <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">call on the people of Zion to rise up against the Inquisition</span>. The protagonists had been very careful to never tell any lies in those broadsheets, and even included easily checked local news to increase their validity where they were posted. Compared to the Inquisition's constant lies and denials, it made it easy for people to decide what to do.</li><li> Merlin makes the decision early on to avoid outright lying to people as much as possible because he's aware that at some point the truth will come out about him and Safehold's true history, and he wants to have a reputation of having been as honest as he could be given the limits of what he could tell people.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask</a>: Sharleyan. The throne of Chisholm was given to her when she was twelve years old, and she had to learn to be, or at least appear, as hard as possible in order to both <em>keep</em> that throne and govern her kingdom. One reason she cherishes her relationship with Cayleb is it lets her feel more like a woman than a queen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>: The Charisian navy after Merlin's innovations take hold.

He proves them correct, too, as his overhaul of the Dohlaran navy makes it the only nation that can even <em>attempt</em> to challenge Charis at sea. More importantly, the only reason they don't have him assassinated is because he actually tries to treat his prisoners of war honorably.</li><li> The whole Dohlaran military gets this from Charis, to the extent that a Charisian soldier who would gladly kill a helpless Army of God soldier spares a Dohlaran who he's knocked out on-mission, because of the sense that the Dohlarans don't deserve to be paying the brutal butcher's bill that Charisian firepower is exacting from the Temple Loyalists. This attitude also results in very cordial relations between Charis and Dohlar after the Jihad is over, as most Charisians will agree that Dohlar fought a relatively clean and honorable war.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>: The official history of Shan-wei's fall and the War Against the Fallen was written by the Archangel Chihiro, who had fought the war on Langhorne's side.

Initially, Nimue wanted to touch off a world war because it would force Safehold to develop new technologies and break through the Proscriptions of Jwo-jeng; either Charis would win, or it would lose, but in losing it would force the Temple to utilize technologies that they couldn't bottle up again.
