It centers on a family of bears composed of Mama and Papa Bear, and their children, Brother (formerly Small), Sister, and Honey Bear. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisNameReallyIsBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisNameReallyIsBarkeep">those are their real names</a>. It started out as series of simple picture books in the line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss">Dr. Seuss</a>, but soon evolved into a series of story picture books for children. Starting in 1993, the Berenstains (that's the authors) began writing Big Chapter Books, which put the characters into more serious situations in much longer (but still kid-oriented) books. The picture books have also taken several formats as well, ranging from small hardcovers written in rhyme, to square picture books. Almost all of the books take the title <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNameAndTheNounPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNameAndTheNounPhrase">The Berenstain Bears and __________</a>"</em></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Note that the name is spelled Beren</a><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">stain</a></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">.

For example, the circus boss Captain Billy is also the ringmaster, his enforcer Otto is Primo the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World&#146;s Strongest Bear</a>, and their head clown is the janitor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>:<ul><li> Once they get over the initial shock, this is Mama and Papa's reaction to the "Trouble with Grownups" play in the PBS version; in the picture book Mama Bear laughs with tears in her eyes in the audience while Papa stares in bewilderment. With the idea that turnabout is fair play when Mama and Papa dress up as the cubs.</li><li> Also, this is how the entire family reacts in the picture book of "Too Much Vacation" when they review their vacation photos, with appropriate captions.</li><li> Sister, after Brother Bear scares her with a mystery he reads aloud, is able to tease him about it after Papa Bear installs a nightlight in their bedroom. Meanwhile, ironically enough, Brother Bear is creeped out by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">Nightmare Face</a> she makes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The cartoon adaptations of the storybooks would often add in scenes that weren't in the original stories. For example, the cartoon version of <em>The Truth</em> has Brother and Sister play a bit of soccer outside before they eventually go back inside and break Mama's lamp.<ul><li> While the book version of <em>Get the Gimmies</em> simply dealt with the cubs' greed and tantrums, the cartoon inserted a "let's think of others in need" variation that changed the whole moral (probably because the original storyline would have been <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narmy</a> and unfitting with the slow-paced tone of the show).</li><li> The cartoon version of <em>The Sitter</em> actually shows Mama &amp; Papa Bear at the community meeting; apparently, their whole reason for going in the first place was because Papa was frustrated with the fact that the gas stations no longer served free coffee &amp; donuts.</li><li> The cartoon version of <em>The Trouble with Grownups</em> gives an explanation as to Mama &amp; Papa's bad tempers - Papa's jigsaw breaks down, so he needs to use the "for sale" section of the paper (which is why he gets mad at Brother for taking it without asking), and Mama has been expecting an important call, which is why she gets mad at Sister for hogging the phone. Also, Mama and Papa apologize for being hard on the cubs, and point out that while they agree that it isn't always easy being a cub, being a parent isn't easy either, leading to the role reversal when Brother and Sister disagree. Just like in the book, Brother and Sister promise to take newspapers from the recycling box when they need one and to try to stop using the phone so much respectively, but Mama and Papa also promise to try and be more patient with their children whenever things get stressful.</li><li> The cartoon version of <em>Too Much Junk Food</em> gives Papa and the cubs a reason to quit junk food - an annual race is coming up in Bear Country and the three find themselves wearing out after running a few miles. A visit to Dr. Grizzly has them realize they have to start eating healthy in order become fit for the race. One notable difference is that in the book Mama puts the junk food in the freezer so that the family would forget about them, whereas in the cartoon the cubs themselves put the snacks in the freezer after their visit to Dr. Grizzly. Also, in the original book, Mama and Dr. Grizzly manage to take the family clean off junk food, whereas the cartoon is more moderate with Dr. Grizzly stating that it's okay to eat such things from time to time.</li><li> <em>Forget Their Manners</em>, in the original book, was a glaringly obvious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a>; Brother, Sister, and Papa clean out of nowhere just suddenly forget everything about being polite for absolutely no reason. The cartoon version addresses this by having Brother and Sister attend a party that Too-Tall happens to be at, and his rude manners manage to rub off onto them.</li><li> <em>Get in a Fight</em> is also a good example of addressing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a>. In the original book, Brother and Sister getting into a fight with each other is mostly just shrugged off, and they just wake up one day angry at each other. In the cartoon version, there's buildup about "waking up on the wrong side of bed", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">what happens when two people wake up in such a way.</a></li><li> In the original book <em>The Week at Grandma's</em>, we don't see much of Mama and Papa Bear's second honeymoon. But in the cartoon version, we do, and Mama and Papa don't have such a great time at the Grizzly Mountain Lodge compared to their first honeymoon, while Brother and Sister end up having fun staying with Grizzly Gramps and Gran (which seems to add to the life-lesson, as Brother and Sister thought they would not enjoy staying with the grandparents for a whole week while Mama and Papa have the time of their lives.)</li><li> The original book of <em>Go to the Doctor</em> just details Brother and Sister's checkup.
