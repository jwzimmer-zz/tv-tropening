Harper Lee herself oversaw the beginning of filming, but after three weeks she <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/books/30lee.html?_r=0">"took off when she realized everything would be fine without her"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication">Adaptation Explanation Extrication</a>: When the children can't find a spot on the packed floor of the courthouse, the black pastor, Rev.

The second time uses it for drama in a climactic moment that displays Atticus' bravery as he faces down a lynch mob, and, after asking them what they are here for, asks the question.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: A group of men ready to lynch Tom, with Atticus risking his life by standing in their way, are stopped dead by Scout when she asks one of them how his entailment (i.e.: an inheritance problem) is coming along. In this case, it's not specifically the question that's armor-piercing so much as that it's coming from the innocent young daughter of Tom's defense lawyer, who is also this man's counselor on the entailment &mdash; it breaks the men out of their mob mentality and they quickly disperse in embarrassment, much to the confusion of Scout, who was only trying to make small talk, inadvertently reminding the man of his obligation and gratitude to her father.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bob Ewell at the end, for <em>many</em> reasons listed on this page</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstonishinglyAppropriateInterruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstonishinglyAppropriateInterruption">Astonishingly Appropriate Interruption</a>: From the gossip at a ladies' missionary circle meeting: "Yes sir, Mrs. Perkins, that J.

In the movie, he is spat upon by Bob Ewell. Atticus looks the man in the eye as he wipes the spit off with a handkerchief, and it is apparent that the man is intimidated by Atticus' mere presence. Atticus leaves without laying a hand on the contemptible man, but it is clear who the stronger of the two is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarefootPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarefootPoverty">Barefoot Poverty</a>: Walter Cunningham.

In the next chapter, as Atticus' children prepare to go to a Halloween party, their aunt mentions an uneasy feeling, "Something just walked over my grave".

In one scene Scout and Jem go to Calpurnia's church with her and, on the way home, ask why she talked to the other black churchgoers in their own dialect when she "knows better."

Jem (here, short for Jeremy) itself is thought of as a girl's name these days.

Throughout the majority of the novel, the kids have no idea what he looks like, and fear him greatly. The simple act of touching his house is a feat for them. But in the end, he's revealed to be a nice, timid, harmless man, as he saves them from Bob Ewell (albeit by killing him) and makes his appearance known.

He treats his children with nothing but love and respect, and a big part of his character is that he refuses to do anything that would lower himself in the eyes of Scout and Jem.

The fact that a nineteen-year-old still thinks of her age in halves serves to show that she doesn't get out as much as she should.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadwomanInTheAttic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadwomanInTheAttic">Madman in the Attic</a>: Boo Radley.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenaceDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenaceDecay">Menace Decay</a>: Scout Finch is a tomboy, but by modern standards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyWithAGirlyStreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyWithAGirlyStreak">she's quite feminine</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice">Miscarriage of Justice</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tom Robinson's fate</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher">Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher</a>: Miss Caroline manages to be this even though she is teaching very young kids. The problem is that most of them are the children of farmers and have done manual labor pretty much since they could walk, so they're not really interested in the story of Mrs. Cat and her kittens. She gets a nasty shock when she meets one of the Ewells, a family who traditionally show up for the first day of school to satisfy the truant officer and hardly set foot in town the rest of the year. She tries to apply basic school rules to the kid and ends up getting "slut" screamed at her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>: Scout, Jem and Mayella lost their mothers long before the story opens.

Also Link Deas, the businessman who stands up and makes a loud public statement of Tom's impeccable character in court during Tom's trial (risking being held in contempt, or at least ejection from the courtroom) then after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tom is convicted</span> he gives Tom's wife a job to help her support the family and stands up for her to Bob Ewell when he starts to harass her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMeanAndInBetween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMeanAndInBetween">Nice, Mean, and In-Between</a>: The supporting women in the story.

He's the authority in the town, but he also displays very few racist tendencies, especially for his time and place. One of his biggest concerns is that keeping a black man in a county jail could cause a ruckus and get him killed. He's right and it almost does. He's also not defending the jail when the lynch mob comes, but it's revealed that the mob reported a dangerous criminal in the area, and sent him on a wild goose chase.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeTitle">Non-Indicative Title</a>: The story has nothing to do with killing mockingbirds or hunting at all.

Even more so the reason that the black man is in trouble in the first place was because he did a number of good deeds for a troubled young white woman because he felt pity for her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMedicationForMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMedicationForMe">No Medication for Me</a>: Beautifully inverted. When Mrs. Dubose, an elderly neighbor, calls Atticus a "nigger-lover," Jem destroys some of her flowers as a result, and as punishment, Atticus makes the boy read aloud to her every day for a month. After the punishment ends and Mrs. Dubose passes away, Atticus reveals that not only was Mrs. Dubose dying of a terminal illness, but she had become addicted to morphine to relieve the pain. She was so determined to die as herself that she stopped taking the medicine; the horrible withdrawal symptoms were only eased by Jem reading to and distracting her. Atticus says that to deny the morphine and die painfully, but clear of mind, is the bravest thing he has ever known.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgicMusicbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgicMusicbox">Nostalgic Musicbox</a>: The film has a music-box-like theme at the beginning. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElmerBernstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElmerBernstein">Elmer Bernstein</a> said he wanted the music to sound very pure and innocent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgicNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgicNarrator">Nostalgic Narrator</a>: The story is narrated by the adult Scout.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NosyNeighbour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NosyNeighbour">Nosy Neighbour</a>: As far as Stephanie Crawford is concerned, she absolutely must know everything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotablyQuickDeliberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotablyQuickDeliberation">Notably Quick Deliberation</a>: Averted explicitly in the book and implicitly in the film. In the book, Atticus opines that, even though the jury returned an unjust verdict, their slowness was an encouraging sign: they almost certainly spent the time talking down a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror">Rogue Juror</a> who wanted to acquit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood">Not Evil, Just Misunderstood</a>: Boo Radley. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He plays with the children in a roundabout way and even saves their lives at the climax.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing">Not Quite the Right Thing</a>: Directly invoked. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Boo Radley kills a drunken, murderous Bob Ewell in defense of Atticus's children, Atticus is all set to get the authorities involved and begin processing the matter by-the-book. The local sheriff, however, warns him that it's an open-and-shut case of self defense, Bob Ewell is widely known and hated, and Boo Radley's extreme social phobias would make the resulting trial absolute hell for him, however pure and innocent Atticus's intentions might be. The sheriff therefore 'officially concludes' that Bob Ewell got drunk, slipped, and fell on his own knife</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">N-Word Privileges</a>: Several of the black characters in the book refer to both themselves (such as Tom when explaining why he ran from the scene of his supposed crime) and other black people (Calpurnia when warning off a hostile woman at church who isn't happy with her bringing Scout and Jem along) as "nigger". However when it's used by white characters in the book, it's still treated with all the harshness of the slur it is, and Atticus corrects Scout when she innocently repeats an N-word insult she'd overheard Cecil Jacobs call him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">Obfuscating Insanity</a>: Dolphus Raymond's long-term commitment to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingDrunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingDrunk">Playing Drunk</a> is a form of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>: Dolphus Raymond channels this, carrying around a bottle of what everyone thinks is whiskey in a brown paper bag (it's actually Coca Cola) and drinking from it. People use alcoholism to justify his "strange" behavior (being a white man married to a black woman in Alabama in the early 20th century).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObjectTrackingShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObjectTrackingShot">Object Tracking Shot</a>: The camera pans around the childrens' box of gifts from Boo Radley in the opening credits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>: The prosecutor manipulates Tom into saying he felt sorry for Mayella, a rather odd statement for a black man talking about a white woman in the 1930s south.

She had a second novel in the works, <em>The Long Goodbye</em>, and a nonfiction book based on the Willie Jo Maxwell killings, but nothing ever came of either of them. She contributed substantially to Truman Capote's <em>In Cold Blood</em>; this is her only other work to see the light of publication.

In the middle of it is a courtroom drama.

That line was cut from the film for obvious reasons, but Mayella's actress Colin Wilcox-Paxton said she communicated the incestuous relationship through her body language and facial expressions. She revealed in the documentary that comes with the deluxe DVD set, that she was acutely aware that Mayella's experience was real. "I saw these girls on the streets of violence, these very underprivileged girls. These girls from awful, awful backgrounds. I mean, most of them took it for granted they'd be molested by the time they were... certainly 12, by a father, an uncle, a brother &#151; or someone down the road."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>: Calpurnia, who acts like a mother to Scout and Jem.

Fortunately, Scout snuck out and followed him that night. Her sudden appearance and apparent innocent lack of understanding of the situation (greeting the men warmly and asking about how their kids are doing since school ended for the summer) takes all the steam out of them and they are too ashamed to carry out their violent intentions. As Atticus puts it later, she reminded them they were (good) men and not a mob.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullTheThread">Pull the Thread</a>: Atticus successfully pulls many threads in the Ewells' story of how Tom raped Mayella, particularly in the disparity of Mayella's bruise and Tom's handicap <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but the all-white jury ends up finding him guilty anyway.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a>: Scout-as-narrator explains that children of lawyers often assume that whatever colleague their parent goes up against in court is a bad guy, only to be mystified by the sight of them acting like friends when court's not in session. By the time of Tom Robinson's trial, Scout and Jem have outgrown this, and they're familiar enough with the prosecutor, Mr. Gilmer, to recognize and appreciate the tricks he employs, all in the spirit of a fair trial. Neither of them is quite old enough to realize until the guilty verdict that that's not what's going on this time, and for the case of a black man accused of raping a white woman, no one's bothered hitting any punch clock.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove">Puppy Love</a>: Scout and Dill&#151;although it's rather ambiguous if they acutely have crushes on each other, or are just claiming they do as part of acting grown up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVillainy">Pyrrhic Villainy</a>: Bob Ewell wins the court case and Tom Robinson is convicted, but Atticus makes a fool of him, which drives Bob to actions that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> later lead to his death</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>: Believe it or not, <em>Go Set a Watchman</em>, the first full-length novel written by Harper Lee (which wasn't published until 2015), portrayed Atticus as a bigot.

The man displays very few prejudicial qualities, and is actually very nice. He testified at the trial, but his testimony was only objective crime scene evidence. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Boo kills Mr. Ewell</span>, he finds out and easily traces the evidence and figures out what happened, telling Atticus (who thought his son did it in the confusion) that he won't prosecute it. In the end, he says that the death was just, and dragging it into court will just upset a man who wants to be left alone, and it avenges another very wrong death.</li><li> Atticus Finch, as he retains plenty of respect from the town even after he defends a black man, and he still remains an important figure.</li><li> Judge Taylor calls on Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, knowing that only Atticus would undertake the task seriously.

It is reasonable to assume that the rogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryAndWitnessTampering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryAndWitnessTampering">may have gotten death threats</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanAClef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanAClef">Roman &agrave; Clef</a>: The story is based on Harper Lee's childhood as well as the Scottsboro Trials.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">Rousseau Was Right</a>: At the end, when Scout is talking about a story read to her:<div class="indent">''An' they chased him 'n' never could catch him 'cause they didn't know what he looked like, an' Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things...

Of course, it's wrong.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryMinoritySuspect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryMinoritySuspect">Scary Minority Suspect</a>: Tom Robinson. Although he is a very nice man who isn't scary in the least, and of course, is completely innocent. However, most of Maycomb assume he is a scary minority suspect who did rape Mayella because of the prevailing racist attitudes of the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolIsForLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolIsForLosers">School Is for Losers</a>: Scout thinks school is utterly useless, and spends a while trying to convince her father to let her stay home, since he never went to a day of formal school as a kid and managed to become a lawyer anyway. In all fairness to her, her town's school system is pretty ridiculous &#151; her first-grade teacher is annoyed that she already knows how to read and write, and tells her she needs to stop doing both until she reaches the appropriate grade level. Needless to say, she's not pleased, and tries a number of things to get out of going to school, including briefly becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadySwearsALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadySwearsALot">Lady Swears-a-Lot</a> in the hope that her father won't make her go anymore once he finds out she learned it from other kids. (It doesn't work; if anything, he seems to find it slightly amusing.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewPolitenessImASenior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewPolitenessImASenior">Screw Politeness, I'm a Senior!</a>: Mrs. Dubose casts aspersions on the entire neighborhood, but Atticus tells his children to leave the poor, sick, old woman alone. Then again, that probably has more to do with his general decency than anything else. Well that and the fact that he had some admiration for her since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was addicted to morphine and trying to quit before she died of the disease she had. Dying slowly and very painfully instead of easily without pain if she had just stayed on it. That takes guts</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">Shaming the Mob</a>: Scout's shining moment, where she got a lynch mob to disperse by speaking calmly to them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInaccurate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInaccurate">apparently oblivious to the seriousness of the situation</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShearMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShearMenace">Shear Menace</a>: Boo Radley is said to have nonchalantly stabbed his father in the leg with scissors while clipping articles from a newspaper, followed by wiping the blood off on his pants, and continuing to clip the newspaper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a>: Subverted. When Mayella arrives at the trial, her poverty does not allow her to dress up nicely, but it's clear she's taken care to wash and groom herself the best she can. This is in contrast to her father, who looks like someone took a scrub brush to him. In the film version, she wears a shabby dress and bow in her hair, and the effect is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44TG_H_oY2E">quite sad<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. During an interview on the DVD extras, the actress states that wardrobe wanted her wear high heels. She said she would, if she could wear socks. When wardrobe told her no one wears socks with high heels, she told them "They do where I come from."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a>: A literal example with Atticus Finch and Tim Johnson</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: "Miss Caroline (...) mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall." It's a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindInTheWillows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindInTheWillows">The Wind in the Willows</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer">Simple Country Lawyer</a>: Subverted: Atticus was a well-educated man who abhorred the opinions of his neighbors, but incompetent parodies make him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer">Simple Country Lawyer</a>. He does, arguably, qualify as a <em>very</em> downplayed version of the trope: his ability to communicate with people much less educated than himself makes him effective in the courtroom, and his being a native of Maycomb gives him bona fides.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue">A Sinister Clue</a>: Bob Ewell, perhaps the only character who can legitimately be called evil, is left-handed. (He's technically ambidextrous, but he prefers his left.) This is more than a symbolic clue to his true nature, since Mayella's injuries were caused by a left-handed man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinnyDipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinnyDipping">Skinny Dipping</a>: Implied.

The Cunninghams and Ewells are at the bottom of white society and people from "fine families" don't associate with them and treat them as inferior, morally and socially. Multiple times Scott discusses this concept with her viewing everyone as equal while Aunt Alexandra heavily buys into the class system. But being from a fine family doesn't stop Maycomb County from being morally corrupt and racist and some of the most noble acts come from the outcasts. The book lands on Atticus' side - that's is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">behavior that ultimately matters</a>. Anyone who takes advantage of a black man is <em>trash</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy">Slouch of Villainy</a>: The lawyer for the prosecution slouches with one leg over the arm of his chair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleWearGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleWearGlasses">Smart People Wear Glasses</a>: So naturally, Atticus does.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowedIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowedIn">Snowed-In</a>: The kids get the day off from school because of a light snowfall, a rarity in Alabama.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoCalledCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoCalledCoward">The So-Called Coward</a>: Atticus refuses to teach his children to shoot, leaving that to Uncle Jack.

He's sort of the genteel southern elite, an erudite, upper class Southern gentleman. Fortunately for his children and his client, he also displays an educated, liberal tolerance and gentility as well. He <em>is</em> a crack shot with a rifle, though he tries to keep that fact away from his children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGothic">Southern Gothic</a>: The story has elements of this, as well as being set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitShake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitShake">Spit Shake</a>: The teacher Miss Caroline asks Scout to hold out her hand (intending to hit her with a ruler as punishment), and Scout wonders to herself "what bargain [they] had made" as she thought "she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral contracts". Is referenced again in the following chapter during a scene with her father, Atticus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulSpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulSpit">Spiteful Spit</a>: Bob Ewell spits on Atticus when the lawyer decides that he will defend Tom Robinson in court.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles">Stoic Spectacles</a>: Atticus wears a pair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StripPoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StripPoker">Strip Poker</a>: Referenced when Atticus demands to know why Jem isn't wearing pants (after he loses them while sneaking around the Radley property), Dill lies and says he won them off him in a game of strip poker and accidentally left them there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a>: Scout.

The central plot (and title) of the book centers precisely around racism and the less-savory aspects of Southern society, but many characters in the book are perfectly sympathetic, kindly folk.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">Sympathy for the Devil</a>: How Scout feels regarding Mayella, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">mocked and rejected by the rest of the town</a> and has been assaulted, possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">sexually</a>, by Bob Ewell. Tom Robinson also states during his testimony that, even though Mayella is basically trying to destroy him, he feels sorry for her, which shocks the jury.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>: Scout's misery with her school system should sound familiar.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfFear">Tears of Fear</a>: It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedTrope">implied</a> that Atticus (of all people!) sheds some after the lynch mob departs.

Of course, the book is set in the 1930s when girls and women wore dresses and skirts a lot more than they do now, so being a tomboy and wearing boys' clothes was more of a meaningful statement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishName">Tomboyish Name</a>: Scout, which is her nickname &#151; her full name is Jean Louise Finch.
