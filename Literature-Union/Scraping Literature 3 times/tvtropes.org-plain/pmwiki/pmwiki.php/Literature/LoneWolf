Kai Lords mostly use them in combat to weaken, disarm or hurt enemies. Villains like the Darklords, of course, have no such qualms and are known to unleash such powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">on minions who've disappointed them</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a>: The Shianti are forbidden from interfering in human affairs, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wytch-King Shasarak, one of their number, is doing just that.</span> Of course, when a human baby accidentally lands on their island, there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">Ain't No Rule</a> about teaching him to use magic and "allowing" him to go into the world to deal with the threat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToEvil">Allergic to Evil</a>:<ul><li> Evil has pretty bad effects on anyone who isn't a supernatural embodiment of it such as the Darklords, and Lone Wolf himself is particularly sensitive to it. The Doomstones for example are the Kryptonite to his Superman (the only reason Lone Wolf's able to get close enough to finish off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of book 15 is the Doomstone he's using is weakened from overuse at the time; earlier in the same book just being close to it knocks Lone Wolf out).

It's not the tomes being so full of evil magic that they harm Lone Wolf the way so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> do so through the series, no. It's literally Lone Wolf getting <em>so angry and outraged</em> by what he's seeing it might actually kill him if he's got low enough endurance! That's right, your own emotions can kill you!<div class="indent">You scan the walls of this reading room and as your eye passes over the books and scrolls stored upon its shelves, you feel an almost uncontrollable urge to tear every one of them to pieces. The wickedness they contain, gleaned after thousands of years of perpetrating the vilest herbcraft known to Magnamund, is so potent that you feel your Kai strength waning in their presence (lose 2 ENDURANCE points).</div></li><li> A similar example happens in <em>Vampirium</em> where Lone Wolf's lieutenant has been charged with capturing an immensely powerful sceptre known as the Claw of Naar and delivering it to the Elder Magi to ensure its destruction. Once he manages to get the sceptre, its immense evilness causes an irresistible urge in the Grandmaster to try to destroy the Claw on the spot with his own enchanted weapon, even though he's been told only the Elder Magi have the power to destroy it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">There is no way to avoid this</a>, it's just a question of how badly damaged your weapon is in the process.</li><li> <em>Legends of Lone Wolf</em> suggest there's even something of this to the weapons the Darklords issue to their rank-and-file soldiers. When Lone Wolf and Banedon have their first meeting Lone Wolf advises him to take one of the fallen Giaks' swords to protect himself, but Banedon begs off because there's an intrinsic evilness even to that kind of weapon that keeps him from being able to touch it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>:<ul><li> The novelizations introduce several key characters such as Naar or Alyss. (Good luck knowing who or what Alyss is otherwise.)</li><li> Also the <em>Magnamund Companion</em>; nothing really vital, or that doesn't come up elsewhere, but loads and loads of awesome world-building. As well as a <em>Lone Wolf</em> board game and a short solo adventure with Banedon as protagonist, providing some backdrop to Book 1.</li><li> The Club Newsletters and various Facebook posts from Joe Dever also fill in some gaps.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>:<ul><li> Those beings created directly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Naar</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Darkness</a>, such as Agarash and the Darklords, have his essence in place of the souls that living creatures possess, accounting for their Always Chaotic Evil nature.</li><li> On the other hand, their servants, such as the orc-like Giaks, are evil only because they have never had any other choice, having been bred and used as warrior-slaves for generations. They do not know love, kindness, or compassion because they have never seen it, and readers are swiftly led to feel pity for them even as they kill and torture their way across the heroes' homelands. The novelizations feature Carag, a Giak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">who turned against its masters</a> and joined Lone Wolf. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, he is implied to have been killed by the Darklords by the end of <em>The Claws of Helgedad</em>.</span></li><li> The Szalls, a Giak sub-race who fled enslavement by the Darklords and settled in the Wildlands, are much more benign. There's a spot in Book 2 where Szalls try to warn you <em>not</em> to go near a monster. (Though the little bastards do steal your horse afterwards.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">Ambadassador</a>: Some of Lone Wolf's adventures start out as outwardly "diplomatic missions", like the voyage to Vassagonia in Book 5. Of course, this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet">Lone Wolf</a>, it always turns quickly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AggressiveNegotiations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AggressiveNegotiations">Aggressive Negotiations</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Amplifier Artifact</a>: The Psychic Ring and the Grey Crystal Ring.

A good way to identify it is the case is when said item is mentioned alongside the name of the enemy next to the stat block. Another common point is that the magic doohickey will never be picked up by the hero afterward, to keep game balance. Either it is destroyed in the fight, too evil for Lone Wolf to consider using, or just forgotten about.<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">most infamous example</a><span style="display:none">invoked</span> is Zakhan Kimah's Orb of Death in <em>The Cauldron of Fear</em>.

That being said, left-handed magic does have at least one offensive spell, Lightning Hand, which enables the caster to shoot a lightning bolt out of his hand.

Although it's only implied in the gamebooks, the novelizations expand on how the Darklords spend more energy plotting against each other, in the hope of becoming the new Archlord of the Darklands, than against the rest of the world (which they were explicitly created by their dark god to conquer in the first place). Only when an iron-fisted Archlord emerges and keeps the others in check do they focus their efforts on conquering Magnamund &#151; and even though this <em>does</em> generally set the Darklords in place to curbstomp all opposition, the backstabbing doesn't stop, it just gets more discreet. Every time the current Archlord is offed by Lone Wolf, it <em>always</em> results in a civil war between the various Darkland factions. Best demonstrating this is the fact that most Darklords' chosen weaponry are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfXSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfXSlaying">Weapons of Darklord-Slaying</a></em>.

Still, there is no "fair" way to beat the maze &mdash; all paths within the maze lead to those two arches, and both of those arches autokill the player if he chooses one.

A raw recruit entered at the age of 7, made Initiate (the rank Lone Wolf has at the beginning of his first adventure) at 16, and completed his training and became a Master at 28. The Grand Master, at the time the highest rank, was anywhere from 56 to 60. Of course, that was the old Order; Lone Wolf would radically shake things up, becoming an Initiate at 15, making Master before 18, and reaching Grand Master at the shockingly young age of 35 (even more shocking when you consider that due to his time in the Daziarn, physically he was just a lick over 23). And even that pales in comparison to his successor in the New Grand Master books, who reached the rank of Grand Master at <strong>14</strong>. Although to be totally fair, those previous Grand Masters rose through the ranks by training under other Kai; Lone Wolf did it by finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin">magic gems invested with the lore of the higher Kai teachings</a> shaped by the hand of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival">Improbable Infant Survival</a>: In the <em>World of Lone Wolf</em> spinoff series, the protagonist Grey Star was an infant who washed ashore on the island home of the mystical Shianti after a particularly violent storm.

The Shianti who discovered the baby boy in the wreckage took his survival despite the odds as a sign that destiny brought him to them. So they adopted him and raised him as their own, teaching him their magic. This was especially fortuitous since Southern Magnamund is being overrun by Wytch King Shasarak <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(a rogue Shianti)</span> and his empire.

The problem comes with the last option, since the player isn't told which spell Lone Wolf will use.

You can also store items for safekeeping between books.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>: Surprisingly, Lone Wolf himself in the <em>Legends of Lone Wolf</em> series is capable of being quite unpleasant to be around.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerJury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerJury">Joker Jury</a>: Lone Wolf gets one such mock-trial in Book 7, <em>Castle Death</em>, from the denizens of said forsaken place.

The second volume is especially infamous as it can result in, among other things, an unwinnable situation because a key item was stolen from you and never recovered, and an instant death outcome because you didn't fetch a magical weapon (which <em>itself</em> can become an instadeath situation because fetching it puts you against one of the strongest enemies in the book). And that's just two of the many, many deaths you can experience in the average <em>Lone Wolf</em> book. The sheer amount of bad ends in this series is staggering, and the enemies you meet in the later books can be absurd, to say the least (the Chaos-master and the Ruel Giganites come to mind).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingYourAlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingYourAlternateSelf">Killing Your Alternate Self</a>: The whole of book 19, <em>Wolf's Bane</em>, is about Lone Wolf pursuing and dueling with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a>, first on Magnamund and then on another world.

If the character is specifically referred to as a "guide" for the protagonist, then his death/capture with subsequent death is almost certain &mdash; being designated as Guide to a Kai Lord is a death sentence. Captain Prarg is probably the most notable exception, as he survives the entirety of <em>The Darke Crusade</em> (despite being assigned as Lone Wolf's guide!), though he gets separated from Lone Wolf a few times, captured twice, even freeing <em>himself</em> from capture once, yet still makes it team up with Lone Wolf during the climax and live through it to cameo in a later book! And that's after he survived another bout of travel with Lone Wolf in <em>The Dungeons of Torgar</em>. Interestingly enough, in that book, another path can lead to never meeting Prarg, instead taking the leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResistance">The Resistance</a> Sebb Jarel as a guide.

Compare the pathways through early installments like book three, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/svg/lw/03tcok.svgz">The Caverns of Kalte<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> or book seven, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/svg/lw/07cd.svgz">Castle Death<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, versus later installments like book seventeen, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/svg/lw/17tdoi.svgz">The Deathlord of Ixia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>.</li><li> Probably a good example is in <em>Mydnight's Hero</em> where the protagonist encounters a patrol.

Every outcome leads to that. Refuse to answer them? You are captured. Try to flee? Captured. Bluff? You have to bribe them, use the wrong currency? Captured. Used the right currency? Patrol wants more, do you try to mind control them? No? Captured. Yes?

Psychomancy can just give you a warped riddle that may or may not be right, and Prophecy sometimes completely fails to illustrate the nature of your impending doom. Use it when you're in a valley of poison gas, it just goes "GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT" without saying which way to go.</li><li> The New Order series adds on "Astrology" to the list of Kai-Disciplines. It's supposed to let you look into the far future rather than the immediate future like Sixth Sense does, but the opportunities to use it come up so rarely it's like the author forgot he put it in the list (only once in the first New Order book, and not at all in the next two). The few times it comes up, you tend to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing">Vagueness Is Coming</a> reading, too.</li><li> For that matter, the Grandmaster upgrade for the previously quite useful Sixth Sense / Divination ability, Telegnosis, is mostly useless, and occasionally actually counterproductive. There are several instances where you take damage simply because you have Telegnosis and your heightened mental sensitivity makes you vulnerable to psychic damage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic">Utility Magic</a>:<ul><li> Kai-alchemy (which has nothing to do with mixing magic chemicals, just go with it) is full of utility spells that help you out in a pinch, but not so much combat magic (that would be Magi-magic, which at its highest level lets you do things like crush a man in armor like a paper cup).</li><li> Elementalism (the Kai version, not the Shianti version) lets you do a number of things with small amounts of flame, dust, water and puffs of air, so it too falls under the "Utility Magic" label.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>: Or in this case, Gamebook Cruelty Punishment.<ul><li> Over the course of the series there are times Lone Wolf can do things that are... morally grey at best. The penalties for such decisions take the form of difficult battles, losing out valuable items, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">dying horribly</a>. Lone Wolf is canonically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>, he should <em>act</em> like it.</li><li> In Book 2; when one of your travelling companions (you don't know which) tries to have you poisoned, you'd better pick the right suspect. The mercenary woman is bad enough, but if you pick one of the Knights of the White Mountain, he <em>and his brother</em> team up and become the hardest fight in the Kai books. They're even tougher to beat than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darklord Haakon</span>! And this takes place <em>before</em> you get the Sommerswerd. Aside from cheating or being <em>very lucky</em>, there's no real way to win this fight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">Villain: Exit, Stage Left</a>: In <em>Fire on the Water</em>, after an attempt at killing Lone Wolf with his magic is foiled by the Sommerswerd, Vonotar the Traitor cover his exit with a cloud of poisonous gas and... undignifiedly flees the death-hulk flagship by frantically paddling on a small boat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVillainNamedZrg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVillainNamedZrg">A Villain Named "Z__rg"</a>: The series absolutely lives off this trope, especially with its double A phoneme; Zagarna being a fine example, the Negud-Kor-Adez, Kaag, Helshezag, if it sounds harsh and guttural it's probably somewhere in the language of evil. This isn't strictly reserved to the bad guys however, with noble if dangerous places named things like "Zaaryx".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>:<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Book 7 (<em>Castle Death</em>), Lord Zahda, is initially portrayed as a charismatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> and arrogantly taunts Lone Wolf when he has him flung into the Maze. While Zahda isn't seen again for some time, his next appearance makes it clear that Lone Wolf's victories in the Maze and his subsequent escape have unhinged him. Zahda goes from a feared sorcerer that even the Elder Magi could only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">seal away</a> to a crazed old man savagely attacking Lone Wolf.<div class="indent"><strong>Lord Zahda:</strong> <em>You will die... die... DIE!!</em></div></li><li> Archdruid Cadak from the Grandmaster series suffers a protracted one. Lone Wolf's victory over the Exterminatus in Book 14 leaves Cadak gaping like a fish with his confidence shattered. In the next book he takes Lone Wolf's victory over his new monster with even less grace &mdash; he gives off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe">This Cannot Be!</a> and spends precious seconds staring at his dead monster in shocked disbelief while Lone Wolf escapes. During his final encounter with Lone Wolf, Cadak's composure is shaken again when Lone Wolf completely derails <em>another</em> evil scheme. By this point his death at Lone Wolf's hands is arguably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainPedigree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainPedigree">Villain Pedigree</a>:<ul><li> The Drakkarim (plural), fierce evil warriors wearing death masks, are more or less the same power level throughout the series, but Lone Wolf keeps getting better and they become less and less able to oppose him. In the "Kai" books, a single Drakkar can put up a good fight. In the "Magnakai" series, Drakkarim are only a real challenge if they attack in group. In the "Grand Master series", they're completely out of their league: the only Drakkar that can still put up a fight against Lone Wolf is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">War God</a></em> in Book 20, and Lone Wolf can <em>still</em> kick his ass and throw him into a lava pit.</span></li><li> Similarly in book 10 you have Demonlord Tagazin, who is presented as a fearsome demonic being. Then he reappears in book 17 as a mere vassal to the far more terrifying Deathlord Ixiataaga.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginSacrifice">Virgin Sacrifice</a>: In <em>The Chasm of Doom</em>, the virgin Madelon is planned to be sacrificed at the edge of the Maakengorge by bandit lord Barraka and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Acolytes of Vashna</a>, in order to raise Darklord Vashna and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">army of undead</a>.

Considering that their preferred form of attack is choking victims with their skeletal hands, it's probably best that <em>Lone Wolf</em> never invokes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSquick">Shapeshifting Squick</a> trope.</li><li> Also the Nadziranim, who are fond of adopting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">combat form</a> before a fight through their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>, since in their natural state they're basically formless specters.

Its natural form is some sort of horrible ape-like <em>thing</em>. Hunting down a supernatural shapeshifting murderer in the dead of night in the middle of a small city is hands-down one of the best parts of Book 21.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">Walking Armory</a>: Not necessarily so, but it's possible for Lone Wolf to be this if the player wants. At best, just going with the special weapons, by the end of the Magnakai series you can carry the magic spear, the Sommerswerd, the Dagger of Vashna, a jeweled mace, the Silver Bow of Duadon or a Bronin Warhammer (those two are mutually exclusive), an enchanted bullwhip and the Darklord sword Helshezag &mdash; all at the same time. Add in how the player probably also has a pair of normal weapons because of all the chances to pick up free ones, and... you can easily imagine any of the scenes preceding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">the hero being thrown in jail</a> to involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedDisarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedDisarming">Extended Disarming</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkIntoMordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkIntoMordor">Walk into Mordor</a>: Lone Wolf's sole modus operandi is to take the most convenient conveyance to the vague borders of Evil Land and then walk the rest of the way.

Since Magnamund is a world in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a> (no huge polluting industries)... In Book 12, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they create a device that negates this weakness, allowing the Darklords to curbstomp most of Magnamund.

Although creatures with a resistance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> are much more common, some others like the Kwaraz giant lizards or the Akataz warhounds are very susceptible.

In exchange for his help, the guildmaster only ask for one thing: to return the ring worn by his son, who had ventured there and likely gotten killed some time ago. Which is, in all likehood, the Psychic Ring later found on the finger of a mutated psychic ghoul. However, once back on the surface Lone Wolf never hears of the Thieves' Guild any more, and can keep the Psychic Ring for further adventures.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteStallion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteStallion">White Stallion</a>: Wildwind, the horse offered by Gwynian the sage to Lone Wolf in <em>Dawn of the Dragons</em>, is described as a magnificent white stallion, and the finest steed the hero's ever seen.

In a huge tavern filled with soldiers, some men punished for cowardice are standing in line with a fruit on their head, while a rider on horse from the same regiment tries to skewer it with a lance!
