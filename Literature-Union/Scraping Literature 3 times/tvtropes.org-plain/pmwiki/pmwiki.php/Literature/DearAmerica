He later murders the man who cares for Clotee like a daughter in her stead (he swears it wasn't intentional, but he was still unnecessarily rough with the man over an incident that wasn't his fault), and then banishes the man's wife, who had been the cook, to the fields because he's afraid she'll poison him. "Miz Lilly", the aforementioned wife, tries to emotionally manipulate Clotee by reminding her of how she and her mother were 'best friends' and get her to tattle on the field slaves.</li><li> The Davises, Patsy's owners, are not at all loved by Patsy, but after Sir's death, she figures that he wasn't the worst slave owner. He never said a kind word to her, but he didn't whip her, either. Ma'am, on the other hand, complimented her once.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Land Of the Buffalo Bones</em>, Polly's best friend Jane is violently abused by her father, so much so that even Polly's father, upon learning of the abuse, sides with Jane, giving her a Christian marriage to her Native American husband <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0prao');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0prao" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0prao');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they had been married by his customs, but the English would not recognize that as a valid marriage</span> so that he can be justified in not returning Jane to her father.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademicAthlete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademicAthlete">Academic Athlete</a>:<ul><li> The protagonist of <em>With The Might of Angels</em>, Dawnie, has the highest grades in the elementary division of her school but more than anything wants to be part of the All-American Girls Baseball League. (The epilogue reveals she eventually changes her mind and becomes a doctor.)</li><li> Max, Julie Weiss's brother from <em>One Eye Laughing, the Other Weeping</em>, skipped a grade, reads Rilke, attended Vienna University, takes fencing lessons, and plays on a Zionist soccer team.</li><li> Kat from <em>A Time For Courage</em> is a hockey player that struggles with math and Latin, but really starts improving throughout the story and uses her Latin and readings to make comparisons to gladiator fights and the Suffrage movement.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> <em>My Secret War</em> had Maddie coming upon Nazi saboteurs on the beach and later being stalked by them, a car even tried to run her over!</li><li> The <em>many</em> child deaths in <em>Across The Wide And Lonesome Prairie</em></li><li> The Stewarts in <em>The Winter Of Red Snow</em> have lost five sons in infancy. So there&#146;s a lot of fear surrounding Johnny, their sixth son.</li><li> The death of Teresa's sister, Netta, in <em>West to a Land of Plenty.</em> She's ill from a known epidemic, but doesn't tell anyone.</li><li> When there&#146;s news of a factory fire in <em>Dreams in the Golden Country</em>, Zipporah&#146;s mother panics, thinking it&#146;s her older daughter Tovah&#146;s workplace. Luckily, it isn&#146;t. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But it&#146;s Mamie&#146;s....and she doesn&#146;t make it out alive.</span></li><li> The protagonist of <em>Standing In The Light</em> is kidnapped along with her brother, and their parents have no way of knowing what's happening to them, so one can only imagine that they're picturing scenarios much worse than the reality (that the children have been adopted by the tribe and are being treated well). Later, Caty herself panics when she notices her brother seems to be forgetting his English life, afraid that he'll lose his identity the same way Snow Hunter, another English captive, did.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a>: Some of the girls have these:<ul><li> Zipporah Feldman (Zippy)</li><li> Lucinda Lawrence (Cinda)</li><li> Remember Whipple (Mem)</li><li> Katherine Bowen (Kat)</li><li> Mem calls her friend Humility Sawyer "Hummy."</li><li> Zipporah Feldman's mom has Yiddish "baby names" for all three of her girls. Tovah is Tovala, Miriam is Mirmela, and Zipporah is Zippola. Zipporah's dad also calls her his "little potato angel" because he used to call her "little doll," until she said she'd rather be called a potato.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>:<ul><li> The Star Points in <em>My Secret War</em>, they are made up of vapid girls who only care about being pretty and stylish.

Chances are, if the main character has a younger sibling older than an infant, they are going to be this. (If she has multiple younger siblings, it may not be all of them, but there will be at least one.)<ul><li> Chances are also that something is going to happen to make her realize her sibling is more important than she wanted to admit. Teresa <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> loses Netta</span>, Grace and Ruth spend several days trapped in an abandoned house <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and then Grace has to watch Ruth handle the death of her best friend</span>, and Laura, having ruined Polly's painting paper, makes a Christmas wish for Polly to get more paper rather than wishing for something for herself.</li></ul></li><li> There are also some protagonists who are seen as this by their own older siblings. Molly from <em>Where Have all the Flowers Gone</em> is said to have been an annoyance to her brother Patrick (confirmed in his own words in his <em>My Name is America</em> counterpart story), if more because he felt that her intelligence made him look stupid than because of any actual act she took. Deliverance from <em>I Walk In Dread</em> also frequently irritates her older sister Remembrance (the feeling is usually mutual). And Nellie Lee of <em>Color Me Dark</em> also has moments of this towards older sister Erma Jean, though they're normally close.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: Molly Flaherty gives her uncle one in <em>Where Have all the Flowers Gone.</em> Upon hearing him make remarks against blacks at a New Year's Eve party, she asks, alluding to his career as a fireman, what color the two little kids he recently saved from a burning apartment were. He replies they were black, so Molly asks, "If you had known that before, would you have gone in there?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>: In <em>A Coal Miner's Bride</em>, Anetka's hand in marriage was promised by her father to an acquaintance (who needed a mother for his children) in exchange for tickets to bring her and her younger brother to America from Poland. On the boat, Anetka befriends Lidia, who was disowned by her parents because they had arranged a marriage for her, but she decided to defy them and marry her sweetheart instead. (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a>)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>:<ul><li> In <em>My Heart is on the Ground</em>,about Nannie Little Rose, a Lakota Indian girl who is sent to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Indian_Industrial_School">Carlisle Indian Industrial School<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010423053053/http://www.oyate.org/books-to-avoid/indianSchool.html">institution (run like a prison)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> meant to teach Indians to be "white". Firstly, Nannie probably would not have been given a diary in the first place, which discounts the whole book. But, let's say she was. She would not refer to herself as "Sioux", instead she would use her area or band. Rinaldi also gets many Lakota customs wrong, mainly by using American descriptions of them rather than finding out what actually happened.
