When Max asks why frontier furies seem to be so much stronger than city furies, Tavi explains that, according to one theory, since the frontier holders who claim them <em>think</em> that they are wild and strong furies, that makes them stronger than they actually would be than if the frontiersmen knew they were just relying on their own strength.</li><li> To quote Maximus:<div class="indent"><strong>Maximus:</strong> In the course of my life, I have more than once been too ignorant to know that something was impossible before I did it anyway.</div></li><li> Most Aleran scholars believe that furycrafting does not work if the crafter is not connected to Alera itself; for example, it is suspected that earth- or watercrafting would be impossible on the foreign continent of Canea. Thankfully, when they actually end up in Canea, nobody thought to inform the first crafters ashore, who went ahead and crafted anyway.

From the second book on, most Crafters have an aptitude for one or two elements but can command at least five to some degree, and are able to call on any Fury in the environment around them rather than using a specific one that follows them around. This is addressed as being a difference in the development of each region of Alera, as the furies used by most people in urban and heavily-settled areas are more "diffuse" due to centuries of what amounts to domestication, while in the wilderness and frontiers the furies tend to be more discrete and individual.</li><li> The second novel has a mention of Bernard having served in the 4th Rivan Legion.

Earthcrafting makes someone super strong, but it does not increase weight and you have to be touching the ground to use it. Throwing an earthcrafter on a wooden deck cuts off their strength, making them an easy target if they are relying on their crafting too much.

In short, women without Knight-level furycrafting are generally out of luck in Alera, at least until Gaius promoted Isana. This becomes an important plot point as the series progresses, as Isana's promotion is taken as an official statement by the First Lord regarding parity of genders and a sign of his power, making Isana a target for those trying to undermine Gaius' authority. It also resulted in an increase in sale prices for female slaves and caused chaos and pressure in the slave trade in general.

All Alerans can harness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>, and while other races have some degree of magic among them, humans have the greatest and most common access to it. Interestingly, this works as a disadvantage as much as an advantage, since they tend to have trouble thinking about non-magical methods of accomplishing things (meaning, for example, that there exists no really advanced technology, beyond maybe air coaches and ships, both of which even then can be created using furycrafting). Similarly, though to a lesser degree, the Canim have a whole caste who are just magic users, though seeing as the ritualists are a rather secretive and elitist bunch it&#146;s unclear whether their powers are hereditary, or just an art they keep to themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a>: During the Vord War, Tavi makes a declaration regarding this concept.<ul><li> The freemen and slaves of Alera <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are permitted to accept the Vord Queen's offer of amnesty and mercy.

In <em>Academ's Fury</em>, Serai realizes that Amara and Bernard are in a relationship given the way Amara's voice changes when she talks about him, and she deduces that he must have been doing something strong and manly in Amara's line of sight to get that kind of reaction (he had been lifting very large and heavy objects). Amara feels the most feminine when she is experiencing his prodigious strength.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>: Because of the nature of the series, every single character encountered either has a magical ability of some sort, or has developed the intelligence and skill to survive when faced with such.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: The fifth novel explains that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Canim</a> as a culture prefer having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> over having a friend: a friend can disappoint you, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> can always be trusted to try and kill you. The Canim even have a specific word (gadara) that means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>. When Nasaug addresses Varg, he does so as <em>gadara-sar</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>-Father), which shows what relationship the Canim culture prioritizes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXOfY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXOfY">The X of Y</a>: The first book, <em>Furies of Calderon</em>, referring to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">Elemental Embodiments</a> that permeate the world of Alera, and the central location of that book, Calderon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">You Are Already Dead</a>: Politically speaking, anyway. In <em>Captain's Fury</em>, Senator Arnos attempts to remove Tavi from command and launches into a speech about how his role in the war with the Canim is already at an end. The reputation he has already built will be discarded, he will have no impact on the shape of future events, and his name will be forgotten and lost to irrelevance. Arnos does not even need to kill him, since he is already dead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">You Are in Command Now</a>: For <em>Cursor's Fury</em>, Tavi is inserted into the First Aleran Legion as the Third Subtribune Logistica, a non-critical post that serves as an excuse for him to be present and spy on the legion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He winds up in command as Captain of the whole Legion when the Canim kill or incapacitate every other officer by calling down a bolt of lightning upon the Captain's tent during an officers' meeting, which Tavi escapes while running messages. There are other <em>far</em> more experienced men under Tavi's command, but none of them are officers</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">You Are Not Alone</a>: Tavi's reassurance to Kitai in <em>Academ&#146;s Fury</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he figures out that he has been bound to her as her <em>chala</em>, her totem and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">Bond Creature</a>. Marat tribes are based on having the same totem, and since no other Marat has an Aleran as a <em>chala</em>, Kitai has no tribe and she feels utterly miserable and alone as consequence</span>. She takes this to heart, as when Isana later tries to comfort her for being alone in <em>Captain&#146;s Fury</em>, a smiling Kitai retorts that she is not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood">You Could Have Used Your Powers for Good</a>: Twice in <em>Captain's Fury</em>:<ul><li> Tavi laments Senator Arnos' martial incompetence and self-aggrandizement, as with his political influence and admitted intelligence he could have been a great asset if he cared more about solving the problem instead of undermining Tavi to make himself look good. He goes so far as to explicitly say as much to Arnos, but when Arnos instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">tries to turn it around that Tavi is no better</a>, Tavi realizes that Arnos really is that far gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">and says that he won't be helping anybody after all.</a></li><li> While undercover amongst the First Aleran, Fidelias comments to Lady Aquitaine that she could remove her disguise and take charge, using her power and strength to lead the doomed men to victory and gain all the political power and respect from her "Big Damn Heroine" moment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She simply states there is no guarantee she could win and would rather simply let the men die and escape herself</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>:<ul><li> At the climax of <em>Furies of Calderon</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fidelias cuts Atsurak's throat in the midst of the Second Battle of Calderon in order to remove any connection between the invasion and Aquitaine</span>.</li><li> During the campaign against the Canim in <em>Captain's Fury</em>, Lady Aquitaine orders Fidelais to assassinate Antillus Crassus after he has helped the Senatorial Guard defeat the Canim and he will no longer be necessary to help command the First Aleran</li><li> At the climax of <em>Captain's Fury</em>, Lady Aquitaine orders Fidelias to kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whoever survives the <em>juris macto</em> between Tavi and Senator Arnos</span>, and assures him that afterwards she will fly the two of them away from the conflict. Fidelias, aware of how she thinks and how much simpler it would be for her if he were to also disappear, knows that she will leave him to die as well after he has fulfilled his purpose.</li><li> If you're noticing a common thread of "Aquitaine/Lady Aquitaine" in these entries, it's because this (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>) is kind of Lady Aquitaine's hat.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe">You Just Told Me</a>: In <em>First Lord's Fury</em>, at the culmination of Magnus's suspicions over Marcus's history, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during a fight with some Vord, he yells, "Fidelias! Behind you!" and "Marcus" whirls around.</span> Tavi, who'd agreed to the plan thinking he'd <em>exonerate</em> Marcus, is very, very pissed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid">You Need to Get Laid</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Furies of Calderon</em>, Count Gram heartily approves of seeing Bernard and Amara together, as he felt that Bernard's life would be "fixed" by a woman. Later, Bernard gets this from his own earth fury, Brutus, when he and Amara are locked in a cell together, and the fury starts earthcrafting both of them into arousal before they realize it.</li><li> Sir Miles to Gaius Sextus at the beginning of <em>Academ's Fury</em>. It is said without the humor customary of the trope, as Miles realizes that Sextus is working himself to emotional and physical exhaustion, and he realizes that Sextus will burn out if he does not get some rest and relaxation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of the book, it is implied that he did, in fact, eventually have sex with his wife. Mostly thanks to Max, oddly enough.</span></li><li> Max to Tavi during much of <em>Cursor's Fury</em>, as Tavi has spent the months since leaving the capital constantly moaning about missing Kitai. It comes up again at the beginning of <em>First Lord's Fury</em>, when Tavi and Kitai are still together, but are not...<em>together</em>...in the evenings anymore.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRemindMeOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRemindMeOfX">You Remind Me of X</a>: When Phrygius Cyricus threatens to kill Varg if he or his allies harm any of the citizens of Phrygia, Varg asks Tavi in Canish if Cyricus reminds him of anybody.

However, when a Queen is not nearby (the Vord are basically animals without a Queen's direction), they play it straight. It's noted that the problems faced by the besieged cities are less like being under attack by an army and more like getting caught in an exceptionally long and heavy blizzard.</li><li> When the Canim first land on Alera, their Raiders are described as moving almost like the tide of the ocean: Rolling, vast and overwhelming. However, as this means they are also disorganized and unguided, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">proper Aleran defenses are able to halt their offenses and beat them back with severe casualties</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
