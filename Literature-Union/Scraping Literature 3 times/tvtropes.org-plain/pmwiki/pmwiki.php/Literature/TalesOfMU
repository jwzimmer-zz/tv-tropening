Originally described by the author as an experiment in using LiveJournal to promote her stories, it has since taken on a life of its own. The first four plotlines have been collected into self-published print editions.</p><p>The story revolves around the life of Mackenzie "Mack" Blaise, a self-hating half-demon student at Magisterius University, a college of enchantment in an alternate universe where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>-style fantasy and magic exist in place of modern technology. While not quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a>, it makes frequent joking allusions to common tropes of fantasy gaming.</p><p>At least for the first half or so of the first year's chapters, the story frequently veers off into sexual territory, arguably at the expense of the plot, but usually by offering a different take on a difficult or sensitive topic. For instance, the second book offered Mackenzie's attempt to describe in first-person narrative her first orgasm, without her realizing that's what she was having. As the story progresses, the sexual content becomes much less frequent, but when it shows up, it does so with gusto.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Chapter 496, plus a number of side stories, concluded Mack's first year at MU. The second year has reset the chapter numbering; so far, 338 chapters of the second year have been released, along with more side stories. Specific chapters will be referred to with the Y__-__ format; first blank is the year, second is the chapter number.

Since the protagonist is a half-demon who is literally damaged by the presence of sacred things, the complete lack of any real guiding code for any faith becomes painfully relevant on a regular basis.<ul><li> The most over-the-top example is probably when it's revealed that the goddess of reproduction doesn't have a coherent position on abortion. Pretty much the one human behavior she's supposed to govern, and she basically shrugs it off as not worth interfering with and is as obstinately unhelpful in providing guidance as is divinely possible.</li></ul></li><li> Averted, however, with Lee Jenkins and the other lawyers of the setting, who are largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigures">Reasonable Authority Figures</a> and good enough at their job that, not only do they often come off as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> even compared to the main cast, frequently a lawyer's presence is a sign that whatever cliffhanger was hung in the previous post is about to go away quietly without further drama.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: The first in-setting week of school sees the protagonist raped at least once (or more, depending on your interpretation of fantasy sexual ethics), roped into not one but two sexual subcultures she doesn't remotely understand, has her girlfriend attempt to induct her into a cult (a cult based on things that are scientific fact in the real world, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, but things that are blatantly, obviously not true in-universe), and sees her almost kill a fellow student in an introductory lab. At worst a comedy of errors from a teenager's perspective, and obviously she later bounces back or clears up all misconceptions, but imagine being a parent and reading this, and thinking back to the fact that your own children probably didn't call you in the first week of college...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a>: Invoked by the author.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlternet">The Alternet</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> ethernet, not like real world ethernets at all.

It linked to the writer's Livejournal crossposting, where comments revealed the prank.

This especially comes into ply when deaing with the Mechans, who are treated as the counterpart to Wiccans in our universe. While it's a bit muddled by the fact that the author, like most authors, lives in a universe with empirically-determinable physical laws, the setting actually does a pretty good job of setting the "physics" up such that the magical view is actually the <em>correct</em> one. Mack's arguments against the Mechans, especially, are 100% valid in terms of what science actually is (in terms of being a method of working out how the world works, not just the set of laws that the system uncovers in ours). The "science" that the Mechans follow relies heavily on ignoring large swaths of empirical data in favor of cherry-picking only a few examples that fit their existing theory, and is in every real sense the opposite of science. To one-up even that, devices reliant on real-world physics and mechanics <em>do</em> work... but only when they've specifically been isolated from magic, such as in an extremely restrictive and uncommon set of physical circumstances. The Mechan faith is the equivalent of someone in the real world creating a physics model without gravity, arguing strenuously against the idea of gravity and ignoring any evidence that it existed, and then pointing to how things behave in free-fall in orbiting space stations as if they "validated" the world view. The comparison to real-life Wiccan magic is, if anything, overly generous; Wicca can at least attribute matters of happenstance to its rituals, but the Mechans are empirically outright wrong.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAWish">Make a Wish</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The entity in Hazel's necklace</span> claims to not be a genie, but has the power to grant wishes.

The characters' foibles, both personal and racial, make up a significant part of the series. The second year throws a twist into this formula. as a substantial fraction of the main cast simply moves out of Harlowe, including several second-string cast members who are obviously nonhuman, and don't catch so much as a sarcastic remark in retaliation. Mack herself is physically the most dangerous and potentially uncontrolled superpower-holder on the campus, and considered simply joining a 'human' dorm as an option (meaning she wasn't so much as pressured to live with the other invincible people).

There's also the fact that every single elf, upon learning that Jamie has put on a magical bracelet that lets Iason turn him into a stag any time he wants to, up to and including Jamie's own elven grandfather, have stopped treating Jamie like a separate being and instead seem to view him as a sort of extension of Iason.

Roughly three to four months of time has actually passed on-screen.
