Each book begins with a song playlist, for starters. While each book does have a single plot that finishes at the end, many of the plotlines stretch from one book to the next. Unlike most books using werewolves and vampires and other horror tropes, and like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> series, the focus is less on conventional horror and more on the political and social issues underlying the problems. The denouement is less often a massive bloody brawl &mdash; Kitty only takes down a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> and a weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">fae</a> herself in the first three books, and the fourth book is the first time a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is taken out by her hand &mdash; and more often about untangling vampire or werewolf politics and managing to <em>not</em> be violent to a nasty politician. As the series has progressed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">the stakes have been raised</a>, however, she has gotten continually more proactive and combative, and the books have had increasingly climactic confrontations&mdash;she takes out the leader of the Band of Tiamat and two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic">Right-Wing Militia Fanatic</a> hunters, and has faced the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> twice.

As annoying, arrogant, and abrasive as he was toward Kitty, he did genuinely stand with her and try to help her before his fear drove him to join Roman, and his constant cries of how weak he was, how he was afraid to face Roman and never wanted to be Master, become much harsher in hindsight as clear cries for help rather than whininess or cowardice. Even after he changes sides, he still tries as hard as he can to spare Kitty's life, and his final attack on her to keep the bounty hunter from killing him for failure is as sad as it is desperate. In the end he manages to stay alive long enough after being staked to tell her where to go to try and stop Roman from getting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>, and the fact by the time she gets there it's too late and his aid was for nothing just makes the whole thing even more pathetic and painful. Kitty herself has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">Sympathy for the Devil</a>, practically crying over his ashes (and does cry for him once she gets back to the house with Ben), and despite Cormac's later truthful assertion that he had been a "disaster" as Master of Denver, she still defends him in her thoughts, saying it wasn't his fault and she didn't want to think ill of the dead.</span></li><li> Amazingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after going half the series alternately hating and being terrified of him, Kitty ends up feeling sorry for Roman as he lies dying from the backblast of the Manus Herculei.

But she does suggest trying to get him to shelter from the sun so he won't be destroyed by the dawn, and as much as Roman suggests she is simply trying to do the ethical thing to salve her conscience and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">couldn't really want to help him</a>, that she'd do better to abandon him after all he had done to her and her friends, she still wishes she could save him.

While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a> of the series makes this trope fairly self-evident, a particularly effective and even insightful explanation (aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a>) for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendFadesToMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendFadesToMyth">why this is the case</a>, yet nobody knows about it, is given in book two when Ahmed explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">Daniel of the lion's den was really a werelion</a> and Enkidu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a></em> was a werecreature as well.<div class="indent"><em>This was thousands of years ago, remember. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmonyWithNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmonyWithNature">Humankind and animalkind were closer then--our years in the Garden together were not so long ago.

He's right, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kitty encounters an aspect of the first Regina Luporum, and may just be guided by/channeling her spirit</span>.</li><li> Knowledge of this trope is what inspired <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roman</span> to find and gather all power in the supernatural world to him so as to take over and rule it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">All Part of the Show</a>: In the very first book, when Kitty is outed as a werewolf by Cormac on the air, later callers (and critical pundits) claim that this was all merely a publicity stunt and that Cormac had in fact been hired to help drive up the ratings. Meanwhile, the animals in Balthasar's show in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a> are all actual lycanthropes, but despite their being smaller than real animals due to conservation of mass, none of the audience members ever realized and just assumed, naturally, that they were watching real animals who were just part of the act. More horrifically, when things first start going wrong at the Montana cabin in <em>House of Horrors</em>, a few of the contestants, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> Conrad Garrett, claim that the new developments are simply part of the reality TV show, more of the same engineered stunts, games, and 'conspiracies' they'd been subjected to already. What is worst of all is that in a way, this <em>is</em> all part of the show, since the real intention of the producers was to, in Kitty's words, make a snuff horror film, showing just how supernatural creatures could be killed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheGoodMenAreGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheGoodMenAreGay">All the Good Men Are Gay</a>: Kitty humorously thinks this of T.J. early in the first book when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">his orientation is revealed</a>.

Examples of the first type are Roman, Mercedes, Jan, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leo</span>, Farida, and to some degree Arturo (although he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> before the end and does what he can to help the heroes win); examples of the second type are Rick, Alette, Ned, Anastasia, the Boss of San Francisco, Antony, and Marid. There are borderline cases though, such as Nasser (since he was willing to encourage someone to take out Kitty because he thought she wasn't strong enough to face Roman); Kumarbis, who started off with evil ambitions but realized the wrong in this when he discovered how far Roman was willing to go and thus set out to stop him; or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Angelo</span> who became 'evil' out of fear and self-preservation rather than ambition, and vampires like Dominic who are only in it for the trappings of power and are otherwise figureheads.

But after what she learns in London, and her announcement at the conference, she herself is regarded as one...and suddenly sees it from the other side, trying desperately to prove her story, knowing it to actually be true, but realizing she can't differentiate herself from the hordes of theorists who are equally "sure" they're right.

It isn't clear if this is true, or whether the curse was expiated after Kitty met and escaped Lawrence Wilson, but it is worth noting that Cormac not only goes to prison after this but encounters a demon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and gets possessed by Amelia</span> while in quick succession after this Kitty's mom gets cancer, she gets caught up in a vampire war and draws Roman's attention, and she encounters the Band of Tiamat, the ifrit, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic">Right-Wing Militia Fanatic</a> TV show producers.

Werewolves almost never get sick, have impressive senses, heal from nearly anything, and move faster than humans can. Kitty still treats the conditions as a chronic disease&#133; although there are downsides made clear. Vampires need blood (not necessarily to kill people, just to drink blood, but even that is a fairly big downside) and burst into flame in sunlight. They have other weaknesses as well, but sunlight is the big one.</li><li> Werewolves shapeshift involuntarily once a month and have to work to suppress it whenever they simply get frightened or stressed. When they do shift, they take on the mentality of their alternate form, which is inconvenient at best and sometimes dangerous to themselves or others. They are also severely allergic to silver, and female lycanthropes cannot successfully carry children to term, as they'll miscarry the first time they have to change shape. We see plenty of characters who don't think of the conditions as diseases, but Kitty's attitude is both a way to help maintain her self-control and a sign that she's clinging to normalcy. Werewolves also have to put up with their animal instinct even in human form. Kitty is shown to have taken subtle "wolf" clues from non-were(wolf)s and misinterpret them, and is also shown to have made the same mistake in reverse to non-weres.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">Cutting the Knot</a>:<ul><li> How do you deal with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a> villain who seems untouchable, incites fear in everyone who knows of him, is gathering allies in secret for a great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order Versus Chaos</a> war to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, and is consistently able to outmaneuver or manipulate everyone to his own ends? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reveal his existence and what he is doing to the world in a live public speech.</span></li><li> The key to winning in the final book comes down to being able to locate where Roman is to stop his spell.

Most of these people, as well as Senator Duke, are acting based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">The Fundamentalist</a> thinking of the supernaturals as creatures of the Devil, but some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">merely see them as animals</a>. There's also racism <em>within</em> the supernatural world, with many vampires seeing werewolves as dumb muscle and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitifulWorms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitifulWorms">vermin</a> and many werewolves (somewhat justifiably) seeing vampires as arrogant, manipulative bastards always willing to control and use them as slaves and cannon fodder. And it seems something of this sort is also motivating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roman to take over the supernatural world</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticReligiousWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticReligiousWeirdness">Fantastic Religious Weirdness</a>:<ul><li> The call that puts Kitty on the map as a talk show host comes from a vampire who wants to talk about being Catholic when he literally can't enter a church, at least not without physical pain. Kitty advises him to read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a></em>. Drawing on her English major background, she argues that Lucifer's <em>real</em> sin wasn't the rebellion against God itself, but his belief afterwards that he was beyond redemption. She advises her caller not to make the same mistake. By her reasoning, a vampire could still be a good Catholic, he'd just have to work harder at it than most people.</li><li> The stakes are upped when, in book 9 Kitty meets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what appear to be gods</span>. It leads to quite the existential crisis when she has to wonder if this truly means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a> and what she believes is called into question.</li><li> Addressed in a different way when the conference is held in London. Esperanza points out that the scientific community's recognition of the reality of the supernatural has caused attendance of religious services to greatly increase&mdash;i.e., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfJesusThenAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfJesusThenAliens">if magic and monsters are real, God must be too</a>, and so they are going to church more for protection against them. This isn't necessarily unrealistic either, since Ahmed had told Kitty Daniel was a werelion, and that was how he saved himself from the lions&mdash;but that he then went on to thank God for making him one, and to contemplate the purpose behind it, suggesting the religious and the supernatural can coincide without abandoning logic. On the other hand, the breaking of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> also caused people in Tanzania to think the superstition about albinos being magical was real, thus justifying killing them for their parts...</li><li> As of book 11, the supernatural and the religious have crossed paths more clearly in the form of the Order of St. Lazarus of the Shadows, since it's not only composed of <em>vampire</em> priests, its members are quite firmly set in their faith that God is real and grants them His blessing to fight the forces of darkness; Father Columban certainly seems to truly believe in God, even if he's willing to accept the pope's declaration of who is a true Catholic and who isn't rather than God's. Note that no explanation is given of how they actually work, considering that in this setting vampires can't handle crosses or even set foot on consecrated ground. Also, in a nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to how this issue first cropped up in book 1, it turns out Milton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a></em> may not be entirely fictional, since the bounty hunter pursuing Father Columban seems to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a></span>.</li><li> On the one hand, Enkidu and Sakhmet somewhat dismiss Kitty's stories of having met <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sun Wukong and Xiwangmu</span>, as well as suggesting there never was a real Enkidu or Sakhmet, merely stories which told of great powers which they would embody and harness for their ritual; on the other hand they genuinely believe not only that they will gain power which they call divine, but they both speak of lycanthropes as having been the messengers or servants of the gods, and of how much godly power lycanthropes have lost since the days of the ancient world.</li><li> After everything that has happened by the end of the series, Kitty doesn't know what to believe in any more, only the full moon, the rising sun, and her pack. And although Rick has proof of God through the Order of Shadows (and those they fought), and concludes he does believe in Him, he prefaces his words by claiming the matter is more complicated than that, and that after all the centuries of mankind trying to use religion to figure out "what it all means", people still don't truly understand.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRomance">Fantastic Romance</a>: Different from most examples, but it's still pretty fantastic to develop romantic feelings for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyMeetsGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyMeetsGhoul">not just a ghost</a>, but one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">possessing your own body</a></span>.

The seventh book, <em>Kitty's House of Horrors</em>, introduces what might be the first determined skeptic of the series: the author Conrad Garrett, who believes that alleged supernatural people are frauds or crazy, that video footage of a werewolf shapeshifting is CGI, and that CDC reports on were-people and vampires are the result of collusion with drug companies who want to make money off the conditions. It's arguably justified, though, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> only was broken in the first book of the series, so there would still be a fair amount of skeptics around.

On the other hand, she does quite fairly point out the problems in those within the fandom who, wishing to truly be a furry and become the species they were "meant" to be, might seek out lycanthropy on purpose&mdash;i.e., that unlike getting a sex change operation as those who feel they were born the wrong gender do, this would be deliberately infecting oneself with an incurable (albeit in some ways beneficial) disease. (A similar moment had occurred with a caller in the first book who believed he was meant to be a lycanthrope and was one "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">trapped in a human body</a>".)

He really must regret those words later...</li><li> With the number of times Kumarbis and Zora keep insisting nothing can go wrong, that they are well protected, the ritual will not leave them open to danger, and Dux Bellorum will be slain, the reader knows long before they do that things will go pear-shaped.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Seeing as Carrie Vaughn might someday write more stories/books in this world, and also that she wanted to give the impression of life going on, a number of loose ends remain at the end of the series. Most of these can be guessed or implied, but a few do stand out:<ul><li> Will Kitty's mom's cancer ever come back, which Arturo seemed certain it would?</li><li> What happened to the rest of the Band of Tiamat?</li><li> The future fates of Emma, Luis and Esperanza, Tyler, Peter, Sakhmet...</li><li> What else is in Zora's Book of Shadows?</li><li> Will Cormac and Tina get together? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or will he and Amelia remain a couple sharing a body?</span></li><li> Will Dr. Schumacher or one of her colleagues ever truly come to understand the supernatural, or find cures for lycanthropy and vampirism?</li><li> Will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ben and Kitty's child</span> turn out to be special in some way after all? And will there be another price paid for him?</li><li> How will Roman's allies in Europe and the Middle East be taken out?</li><li> And most concerning of all, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lightman's comment about there always being another tool, and that he could wait</span>. After having a two-thousand-year-old plot spoiled, he likely won't try anything big again anytime soon, and Kitty rather hopes Earth wouldn't be a battleground again, at least in the near future...but he, Ashtoreth, and the other demons are still out there...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>:<ul><li> A pretty common theme. Senator Duke treats werewolves and vampires as something less than human, and a lot of the less admirable vampires treat humans and werewolves like bugs.</li><li> The hunters in book 7 take this theme to its logical and sickening conclusion, literally turning the supernaturals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">into the prey in a real life hunt</a>.</li><li> Dr. Flemming treats his supernatural patients this way for the most part, despite protests to the contrary and moments of sympathy and caring. In book two Kitty has to remind him several times that Fritz "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeHadAName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeHadAName">Has a Name</a>".</li><li> Amelia contemplates and rejects this after she goes to Eastern Europe to investigate the truth behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> and meets what likely was a real vampire.<div class="indent"><em>What she'd learned about vampires, lycanthropes, skinwalkers, wizards, people who simply dabbled in magic or those whose entire existence was submerged in the supernatural&mdash;they'd all started out as people, which meant they could be understood as people. Their motivations, fears, desires&mdash;comprehensible. They only seemed mysterious&mdash;and mysteries could be solved.</em></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> Kitty calls <em>herself</em> out, briefly, near the end of <em>Kitty Raises Hell</em> when she learns that the ifrit's final message to her had been a plea for mercy for the sake of his wife and children, and that he had only been terrorizing her because the vampire priestess made him do it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">And she had helped consign him to the world</a> of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepTellingYourselfThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepTellingYourselfThat">She immediately tries to convince herself and the Paradox PI team</a> that it was only a play for sympathy, that he had still killed people, and the ifrit's fury, malice, and insulting words to her did seem a little too genuine to be a compelled act. Still, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">the reader can't be sure she was right</a>...</li><li> Both she and Rick (though Kitty with less vehemence) also do this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cormac</span> for his actions near the end of <em>Rocks the House</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad">When You Coming Home, Alpha?</a>: To some extent this mindset is beginning to set into the Denver pack, particularly for Becky and Trey, because Kitty is too busy with her crusade against Dux Bellorum and being a celebrity to be there for them when they really need it. To mirror this, Cheryl makes it clear to Kitty that she has felt neglected and abandoned too when it comes to taking care of their mother should her cancer come back; some of this is inspired by her sister's feeling pressured and directionless in her own life, but there's enough truth to it to sting. By the end of the book Kitty has sworn to take steps to make up for these failures, with so far pleasing results.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK">Who Shot JFK?</a>: Referenced by Dominic when Kitty is pumping him for supernatural stories, specifically that Lee Harvey Oswald's bullets were silver; she's sure he was only joking to make her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> mind go nuts over it, but short of checking presidential appearances against phases of the moon, usage of the White House silver, assassination attempt survivals, and so on, she can't quite be sure...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">Who Wants to Live Forever?</a>: The view of some vampires. Or as Rick puts it, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The end of the world is all some vampires have to look forward to</a>." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome">The rest of them, like Ned and Rick himself, on the other hand....</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo">What Would X Do?</a>: Kitty does a great deal of this during Cormac's time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison">Prison</a>, appealing to his memory and methods to help her weather the conflicts she faces. Nowhere is this more blatant, or more critical to her survival, than during the siege in <em>House of Horrors</em>&mdash;as Kitty says herself, thinking like him saves her life and those of the other supernaturals who make it through.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>: Amelia still has some fantasies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> about this period in United States history, despite the fact she'd discovered in her travels how much the stories did not live up to the reality. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They are disproven upon meeting Layne and Nolan, and having her own "showdown at high noon."</span> Her similar views of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjunCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjunCountry">Injun Country</a> were dispelled when meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">an old Native American reduced to taking pictures with tourists for money</a> and visiting the site of the Sand Creek Massacre.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel">Wizard Duel</a>: Between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Harold</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Franklin</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possessed</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Cormac</a>.

And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">more is better?</a>), the fight is short but oh so sweet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: This was Darren's plan with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Becky</span> to remove Kitty as alpha, having her call and claim he was hurting her so Kitty would rush to the rescue and into his trap. It is foiled because Kitty gets the whole pack behind her, even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Becky</span> once they have a real heart-to-heart.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: Both Mercedes and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roman</span> are good at these.<ul><li> One of the best would be setting up Arturo, the Master Vampire of Denver who, even in book 1, had turned out to be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> or even an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>, to look like he was responsible for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the vampire war with Rick</span> when really he was as much a victim and dupe as anything else&mdash;if Rick went up against Arturo and lost, Arturo would then have no other rivals to his authority, a very old vampire who owed allegiance to no Family would be removed from the picture, and Arturo, having been placed there by Mercedes and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roman</span>, would either support them in the Long Game or not get in their way; if instead Rick wins, he would owe Mercedes for her help and would have to capitulate to her and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roman</span> to maintain his position. The plan was only ruined because of Kitty's return to deal with her mother's cancer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">something they could not have foreseen</a>, and her usage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommissionerGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommissionerGordon">Detective Hardin</a> as an ally. (And because of Arturo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and Rick turning out to be stronger than they gave him credit for.)</li><li> The con set up in book 6 via the ifrit to be banished is even more of an example: if Kitty capitulates to Roman, he will remove the ifrit threatening her but in exchange she will have given him her loyalty; if she stays in Denver and tries to ride it out, her pack will either all be slain or turn on her; and if she tries to face the Band of Tiamat, she will be sacrificed for their dark chaotic cult. Again, the plan is only ruined by surprises from the outside&mdash;the Paradox PI crew (specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">Tina</a>), T.J.'s brother Peter, and Odysseus Grant.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>: Several side characters, including at least three that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">have seen enough</a> to make a good assessment, tell Kitty to her face that she is more than capable of living up to the presumptions many make about her authority and leadership.
