Forester's most well-known work. The eponymous character, Horatio Hornblower, starts as an overaged midshipman at the start of the French Revolution. Though unprepared, shy, and awkward, his knack for innovation and a sense of determination propel him to attempt many daring and improbable feats. While most who meet him recognize him as a daring and intelligent officer, Hornblower can only view himself with "a sort of amused contempt" at best, and vicious self-loathing at worst, thanks to constantly overanalyzing and criticising his motives.</p><p>Fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">eccentricities of the Royal Navy</a> and his own temperament as much as the French and other enemies, Hornblower rises through the ranks with difficulty, worrying about his poverty, the many ways his career could be ruined, and the constant possibility of violent and painful death; meanwhile he conducts his missions to the utmost of his considerable ability. His career is detailed in twelve novels (written out of chronological order) and several short stories, and he rises from seasick midshipman to Lord and Admiral.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The books also describe the mechanics of sailing wooden warships in exquisite detail, but Forester does go to the trouble of (occasionally) explaining the jargon to his readers, which may make them more accessible to the average reader than the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Aubrey-Maturin</a></em> series.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate about whether the character of Horatio Hornblower was inspired by the career of any real-life officers with suggestions including <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cochrane,_10th_Earl_of_Dundonald">Thomas Cochrane<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gordon_(Royal_Navy_officer)">James A Gordon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h2> Novels</h2>Listed in chronological series order with publication dates.<p></p><ul><li> <em>Mr. Midshipman Hornblower</em>: 1950.

Hornblower is about to resign his commission, having betrayed his honour, when he learns of Napoleon's death. Appropriately enough, the chapter is titled "St. Elizabeth of Hungary", whose <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Hungary#Miracle_of_the_Roses">Miracle of the Roses<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is told at the end of the chapter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted">A Fool and His New Money Are Soon Parted</a>: A minor example occurs at the end of <em>Lieutenant</em>.

At the start of <em>Hotspur</em>, Hornblower loses the big wad of cash he wins off the admirals at whist in <em>Lieutenant</em> for less frivolous reasons when he has to finance both a wedding and the commission of his new ship (which was the real prize of that night anyway).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfBlood">Afraid of Blood</a>: When not keyed up and busy in the heat of battle, Hornblower doesn't do well with blood. When he's forced to watch his men dying long before his own ship can return fire, he has to fight not to throw up in front of everyone. He nearly faints when watching a surgeon treat an amputated limb, and just imagining the slaughter of a ration bullock ruins his appetite for beef.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: El Supremo, who is Hornblower's primary ally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and later the primary villain</span> in <em>Beat To Quarters</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToRoutine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToRoutine">Allergic to Routine</a>: Hornblower. Of course, naval life is explicitly <em>very</em> routine, long periods of boredom interspersed with wild activity.

When the insane Captain Sawyer falls down the hold and is conveniently incapacitated, Bush knows both Hornblower and Midshipman Wellard had the motive and opportunity to push him, but if anyone askes directly Hornblower calmly says that Sawyer must have tripped and fallen. Hornblower takes charge of the investigation, further complicating things, and the court of inquiry won't even touch it because they prefer to say <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he died in battle rather than reveal he went insane first. Wellard dies offscreen near the end of the book, so the only person who really knows the truth is Hornblower</span>.</li><li> In <em>Hotspur</em>, Hornblower and his lieutenants discuss the prize system, then the midshipman orders a man to start casting the lead to check depth. Which makes Hornblower's group remember they were sailing towards the shore, and they all realize they could've run aground out of sheer carelessness. Hornblower isn't sure if the middie did it deliberately, and can't, of course, outright ask him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore">American Kirby Is Hardcore</a>: The first book's title, as seen above.

The publishing order is <em>Quarters, Line, Colours, Commodore, Lord, Midshipman, Lieutenant, Atropos, West Indies, Hotspur, Crisis</em> (unfinished). In chronological order, these are books 6-10, 1-2, 5, 11, 3-4.</li><li> The short stories, too, are scattered all over his career. The two included in <em>Crisis</em> take place in 1799 and then the 1850s.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">And Now for Someone Completely Different</a>: <em>Lieutenant Hornblower</em> is the only novel or short story narrated from the perspective from someone other than the title character, namely through Mr. Bush. It demonstrates his sturdy, uncomplicated character and although he's not as innovative as his younger friend, he's able to see Hornblower more clearly than Hornblower sees himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: Hornblower himself, obviously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">makes it to the end of the series.</a> There are no guarantees against anyone else being killed or seriously injured.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the climax of <em>Ship of the Line</em>, Lt.

Forester realized that the incubation period wasn't quite that long, however, and decided that it happened some time during the siege. (The reason it wasn't edited to reflect this is likely because the novels were originally published as magazine serials and collected into book form later.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">A Taste of the Lash</a>: As per the standard discipline of the Royal Navy, a flogging occurs in the first chapter of the first book. Hornblower himself avoids this punishment as much as he can, believing that it makes good men bad and bad men worse. (Although he considers this a rationalization of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">unpardonable squeamishness</a>.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>: According to his biography, C. S. Forester came up with Hornblower and <em>The Happy Return</em> during a one day cruise of the Bay of Fronseca in the motor launch with photographer Barbara Sutro, while on a freighter heading for England while escaping a paternity suit by a fading opera singer. He envisioned Hornblower as himself as he wished he had the courage to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>: Usually subverted. Hornblower might be a brilliant captain, but more than once he thinks that he couldn't match the men's physical capacity for backbreaking work or brawling. However, there are a few occasions where he does fight hand-to-hand (particularly when he's a young man).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a>: This seems to be Hornblower's main method of gambling, seamanship, and war. In one incident, Hornblower challenges a man known to be a better shot then he to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a> with the understanding that there will be one pistol randomly loaded, neither will know which one and the contestants will choose it unknowing and fight at point blank. Thus giving a fifty-fifty chance (better than his odds, Hornblower figures, than in any fair fight). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not knowing that the captain, not wanting to lose either midshipman, arranged for <em>both</em> guns to be left unloaded.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a>: Hornblower is a seadog who uses math skills and meticulous research.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a>: The Royal Navy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoodAsAnExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoodAsAnExcuse">Bad Mood as an Excuse</a>: Hornblower, when he's stressed out, has an unworthy tendency to take out his feelings on Bush&mdash;whose devotion and admiration for his captain makes it impossible for him to stand up for himself. Hornblower usually regrets it quickly, but it's still gratifying to the reader when he snaps at Freeman in <em>Lord Hornblower</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">to no effect</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadToTheLastDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadToTheLastDrop">Bad to the Last Drop</a>: Hornblower's supply of coffee tends to run short early in a voyage. The usual Royal Navy substitute is burnt toast in hot water, which obviously doesn't do much except <em>look</em> like coffee if you squint.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>: Hornblower is pretty good at guessing what the response of enemy captains is during battles. In <em>Hotspur</em>, for instance, he plays the <em>Loire</em> captain's cleverness against him; in <em>Atropos</em> he bluffs the <em>Castilla</em> into thinking that he has allies close at hand by signaling empty ocean.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>: Brown was originally Hornblower's coxswain, became his servant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at first as a ruse because he's a good man in an escape attempt, but he stays in the position afterward</span>, then became his coxswain again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAsUnhelpfulAsPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAsUnhelpfulAsPossible">Be as Unhelpful as Possible</a>: You'd think the, say, Spaniards would give the British Navy all possible assistance when trying to retake crucial military positions. Nope. Heck, everyone outside the British Navy seems slightly or greatly incompetent, and a good deal of the people within. With the honourable exception of the Russians in <em>Commodore</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Flying Colors</em> ends with Hornblower getting everything he's wanted; wealth, fame, prestige, a title, and the way clear to marry Lady Barbara. However, the first four things are part of a propaganda package laid on by the government, and the last is possible by the death of their spouses. He starts hating it before the end of the book.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory">Been There, Shaped History</a>:<ul><li> Usually inverted. Forester deliberately keeps Horatio out of the way of most of the major historical events of the time (for example, the first book has Hornblower way out in the Pacific in 1808 to keep him out of the Peninsular Wars), particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOf1812">tensions with America</a>. This loosened as the books went on, although Hornblower doesn't become Admiral until peacetime.</li><li> There is one short story that takes place during the War of 1812, where Hornblower has a brush with an American ship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Since he's commanding a barely-armed yatch to take the King on a day trip, he evades battle.</span></li><li> In <em>Commodore Hornblower</em> it is implied that his actions were essential to foiling the French attempt to take Riga. In the (unfinished) <em>Hornblower and the Crisis</em>, he helps lure the enemy into the Battle of Trafalgar with a false message.</li><li> It's mentioned several times that as a midshipman he served with Captain Pellew on the <em>Indefatigable</em>, and was present at the sinking of the larger <em>Droits de l'Hommes</em> in 1797. <em>Mr. Midshipman Hornblower</em>, which details his career as a midshipman, ends after his release from a Spanish prison in 1797, several months before the battle.</li><li> Played straight, though not world-shakingly, by the creation of a fictional Wellesley named Barbara whom Hornblower romances <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventually marries, making the Duke of Wellington his brother-in-law</span>.</li><li> Hornblower is put in charge of Nelson's funeral procession. The leading vessel, carrying the coffin, nearly sinks out from under him. (His pocketwatch is also nearly laid to rest with Nelson after Hornblower leaves it hanging off one of the handles.)</li><li> While Hornblower is Commander-in-Chief of the West Indies squadron, a wool merchant of Venezuelan descent forges Hornblower's signature, poses as a Royal Navy officer and seizes a Dutch transport carrying Spanish field guns, which he gives to Simon Bolivar's army. Hornblower realises that those guns secured the victory for Bolivar in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carabobo">the Battle of Carabobo,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which determined the fate of Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru. Hornblower himself captures the merchant's abandoned private yatch (a former Navy brig-sloop), then, through verbal trickery, avoids surrendering it or starting a war with the Spanish and Dutch naval officials.</li><li> The interception of a Spanish treasure flotilla in <em>Hotspur</em> was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_of_5_October_1804">a real battle,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which Hornblower ends up not joining in because he has to stop a fictional French ship from warning the real Spaniards.</li><li> In the short story "The Last Encounter", taking place in 1847, Hornblower assists a man claiming to be Napoleon &mdash; who Hornblower knows is long dead &mdash; in his passage back to France to run in the election for president. Hornblower views him as a harmless madman and helps him out of amusement. The man is revealed to be Napoleon III, Bonaparte's nephew, who wins the election (and several years later stages a presidential coup and crowns himself emperor).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>: In <em>The Happy Return</em>, interrupting Hornblower during his morning walk, which is as solitary as he can manage it on a crowded warship. When Lady Barbara sends her maid up to invite Hornblower to breakfast, the rest of the crew try very hard to prevent it. It sets of an explosion of bad temper when she reaches him and a command that she <em>never</em> interrupt his walk again, and in fact forbids them from coming up on deck while he's on his walk.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>: Near the end of <em>Lieutenant</em>. After the Spanish prisoners escape confinement and capture the <em>Renown</em>&mdash;capturing Buckland and nearly killing Bush&mdash;Hornblower gathers his crew from the three prize vessels and crashes one of them into the <em>Renown</em>, sweeping across the deck and retaking the ship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>: Napoleon's propaganda announcement decrying Hornblower as a pirate in <em>Flying Colours</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlackDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlackDeath">The Black Death</a>:<ul><li> In the <em>Noah's Ark</em> story, Hornblower is sent to pick up supplies from the Algerian city of Oran on the very day it's struck by plague. Normally this would mean he and his men would have to be quarantined there for three weeks since the last case, but he has the novel idea to ride it out on the supply ship he was provided.</li><li> In <em>The Commodore</em>, as the Napoleon's Prussian forces retreat from the aborted siege of Riga, they leave behind plague victims. Hornblower is told by (actual historical figure) Essen that the Russian army has plague in its ranks too. (There is also typhus, which Hornblower comes down with at the end of the book.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBore">The Bore</a>: One way Hornblower copes with the stress of impending action is to make his junior officers play whist with him and then treat them all to exacting and long-winded criticisms of their play.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorrowedCatchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorrowedCatchphrase">Borrowed Catchphrase</a>: Lady Barbara teases Hornblower with this by imitating his standard, ambiguous response of "ha, h'm."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerise</a>: Done in-universe in <em>Hotspur</em>, when Bush has to resign himself to calling the hapless midshipmen from the Naval Academy "young gentleman" rather than swearing at them, in view of Hornblower's preferences.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButIReadABookAboutIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButIReadABookAboutIt">But I Read a Book About It</a>: Hornblower considers constant research both a duty and a pleasure. It enhances his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a> status. This is particularly pronounced in the <em>Midshipman</em> stories, where young Hornblower encounters things in reality he had hitherto only known from literature and sometimes compares the two.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishStuffiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishStuffiness">British Stuffiness</a>: When Lady Barbara suggests to Bush that he's fond of Hornblower, it takes him a moment to reconcile such a sentimental notion in his "sturdy English mind."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a>: Hornblower is near-universally adored by his underlings and respected by his brother captains for his brilliance and continual success. Hornblower considers them to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judges Of Character</a> because he completely despises himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a>: Hornblower is an honorable, dutiful, and humble man who acts with great courage under fire. However, he's also a brooding, melancholic mess whose view of himself is often actual self-loathing, often shocked that people might care about him. Underneath his stoic facade is a world-class worry wort, and his courage under fire (in spite of his fears) is matched only by his cowardice in matters of the heart. He's also tone-deaf and never gets over seasickness, much to his humiliation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">Call-Forward</a>: At the end of <em>Hornblower and the Atropos</em>, Collingwood mentions that the <em>Lydia</em> will be needing a new captain soon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">The Cameo</a>: Many examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter">Historical Domain Characters</a> popping up this way, ranging from various politicians and military leaders, to the American frigate USS <em>Constitution</em>, stated to be on her way to the Barbary Coast to deal with the Corsairs under the command of an unknown officer named Edward Preble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainSmoothAndSergeantRough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainSmoothAndSergeantRough">Captain Smooth and Sergeant Rough</a>:<ul><li> Hornblower is well-read and profoundly dislikes the brutality of war (including that inflicted by the Navy's own policies). Bush considers it right and proper to bellow at the junior officers and sees nothing wrong with floggings and such, more in common with the views of the time.</li><li> In <em>Ship of the Line</em>, Hornblower watches one of his petty officers apply an order with his fist and considers that he himself wouldn't have the physical strength to enforce discipline that way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>: C. S. Forester himself discouraged reprinting of the short stories <em>The Hand of Destiny</em>, <em>The Bad Semaritan</em> and <em>Hornblower and His Majesty</em> because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">continuity snarl</a> <em>The Hand of Destiny</em> caused (the capture of the <em>Castilla</em> and the powder burns to Hornblower's hand).

A marine awaiting court martial for defying an order escapes at the end of Hornblower's tenure as Commander-in-Chief. Hornblower muses that while the marine escaped the jail, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">he was still on Jamaica</a>, and his white face and uniform would stick out like a sore thumb, especially with the standing reward of &pound;10 for returned prisoners, meaning he only added more charges to original crime. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hornblower later finds him in a military band in Puerto Rico, and discovers Lady Barbara paid a merchant captain to free him.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog">Casual Danger Dialog</a>: The protracted discussion between Bush and Crystal in <em>Beat to Quarters,</em> where they academically debate how the <em>Natividad's</em> officers are laying their guns... while they are shooting at the <em>Lydia.</em> Hornblower, who is trying to concentrate (and slightly envious of their nerves), eventually tells them to knock it off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a>:<ul><li> There was zero glamour at all involved in the reality of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>&mdash;living conditions were barely tolerable even without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">the hideous brutality of combat</a>.</li><li> The sometimes-torturous isolation and monumental responsibility imposed on ship's captains (even in the books when Hornblower wasn't commanding a ship).

The admiralty, in fact, hated impressment more than anyone, including those affected (who, being legally limited to merchant sailors, considered it an occupational hazard), and only used it because there was no other viable option. Criminals were offered a pardon in exchange for service, although more often than not they were rejected by the Navy, for obvious reasons. Aside from there only being two instances of actual press gangs (in which the officers responsible were severely punished), any officer who pressed a tradesman, farmer, or anyone with an exemption was in deep trouble.</span> Hornblower (illegally) presses outbound East India Company sailors who were legally exempt in <em>Ship of the Line</em>, and he also presses French prisoners he'd promised freedom in <em>Flying Colours</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift">Continuity Drift</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a> causes this, as the most evident changes in the series timeline occur when Forester jumped back to Hornblower's midshipman days.

It's almost as though it's making up for references that would have been spread out through <em>The Happy Return</em> through <em>Lord Hornblower</em> had the books been written in chronological order.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptQuartermaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptQuartermaster">Corrupt Quartermaster</a>: In <em>Hornblower and the Atropos</em> Captain Hornblower discovers that some of the salt beef the Victualling Yards sent to his ship (the Atropos) is inedible. The superintendent of the Victualling Yards asks that the barrels of bad beef be returned to him, apparently so he can palm them off on some other unfortunate ship's crew. Hornblower considers the possibility that he has some kind of financial interest in doing so, and punishes him by having the word "Condemned" branded on the barrels to warn any other ship they might be given to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterfeitCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterfeitCash">Counterfeit Cash</a>: Hornblower, tasked with sending a man's belongings to his widow, finds a stack of counterfeit bills hidden in a sea chest in <em>Hornblower and the Widow McCool</em>, plus a list of Irish rebels and a propaganda note for printing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He puts it back and has everything thrown overboard, as revealing it and the secret compartment would ruin a fellow officer's career.

He continually does his duty and more in spite of his vivid imaginings, however. <em>Lieutenant Hornblower</em> offers the reader some perspective about that "truth" when Bush observes him pacing nervously before the battle and doubts his courage. When Hornblower's unhesitant action and clear thinking save the ship <em>during</em> battle, however, Bush is entirely satisfied and it's part of why he includes Hornblower in the expedition ashore.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist">Cunning Linguist</a>: Hornblower is fluent in French and Spanish and makes good use of both over the course of his career, although his accent isn't good enough to pass for a native speaker.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutlassBetweenTheTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutlassBetweenTheTeeth">Cutlass Between the Teeth</a>: Young Longley holds his dirk clamped in his teeth in imitation of proper swashbuckling tales whilst on a cutting-out expedition, though he doesn't injure himself while doing so.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVsGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVsGoliath">David vs. Goliath</a>: The <em>Hotspur</em> versus the <em>Loire</em>.

The ship's cannons can't reach the necessary elevation, they run aground, and it's all they can do to escape without being set on fire. Bush reflects that in hindsight, taking a wooden ship into a situation where red-hot cannonballs can be fired into her was <em>not</em> the best idea.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>: Seaman Grimes, from <em>Hotspur</em>.

Coffee was enormously fashionable in England for many years, and London in particular was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse#Coffee_in_Europe">lousy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with coffee-houses in the 1700s. Tea was also more expensive than coffee, and Hornblower&mdash;who is always having to pawn things to complete his ship and rarely gets prizes&mdash;can barely afford jam most of the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>:<ul><li> An accepted practice at the time the books take place, which allows Hornblower to challenge a bullying midshipman during his first voyage.

Hornblower being Hornblower, he quickly adds some reservations to his present state of contentedness, but at least this time they're worries about external forces of war and politics rather than the "pitiless self-analysis" he employed during active service.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName">Embarrassing First Name</a>: Hornblower thinks his first name is pompous and ludicrous.

They do, including a successful capture of a Spanish ship, but Courtney still gloats to Hornblower that he plans to flog the fifteen men the instant the week is up. (This may actually violate his promise, as he'd promised not to flog for "past actions", but Courtney takes it as a loophole all the same.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>: Invoked with Hornblower's general worldview.

The irony being that while readers recognize Hornblower as being ahead of his time, he himself is embarrassed by his "weakness." (Interestingly, though the older Hornblower seems more bigoted, the books with a younger Hornblower were written a couple of decades later&mdash;so this could also be C.S.

He generally leaves Midshipman Hornblower to do what he will because it has excellent results, and when Commander Hornblower is under his command again Pellew writes a very warm letter addressed to "my dear Hornblower" with an invitation to submit plans and suggestions&mdash;a high mark of esteem. He also makes sure to put Bush under Hornblower's command again in <em>Lord Hornblower</em> because he knows they're friends of long service.</li><li> Admiral Collingwood also treats Hornblower very well in <em>Atropos</em>. At the end, he clearly hates having to take Hornblower's ship away from him and tries to soften the blow by fast-tracking him into a new command. (This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, apparently; Collingwood was universally beloved by his men.)</li><li> Hornblower shows this to a much lesser degree, but as he gets older he becomes more and more aware of the youth of his junior officers and frequently considers that they're at the right age to be his sons. As such the burden of ordering them into perilous situations weighs more heavily and he realizes that commodores he'd considered pompous when <em>he</em> was a young officer were probably hiding their worry too.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn">Food Porn</a>: Usually, Hornblower dines on brine meat, weevily biscuits, and burnt-bread coffee. Whenever he gets to eat something more palatable, it's described in great detail. Particularly notable is Pellew's dinner in <em>Hotspur,</em> which goes on for pages and describes the steak-and-kidney pie, wines, fresh veg, and cheeses in increasingly overwrought language.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetsToEat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetsToEat">Forgets to Eat</a>: Hornblower has a habit of not realizing he's just spent twelve hours steering his ship through battle only on the strength of his breakfast.

Hilariously, he has trouble believing anyone could like him, despite evidence to the contrary. Even when he <em>does</em> believe it, he finds some way to make himself rationalize or downplay it.</li><li> In <em>Hotspur</em>, his ship is being fired upon by shore artillery. He hears noise aloft, and a howitzer shell falls to the deck at his feet. He takes a fraction of an instant to realize that there's about a quarter-inch left on the fuse before he hurries to extinguish it. When he stands up, he sees everyone on the deck staring at him, and realizes he's about to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a>.</li><li> He has his men dance the hornpipe during a long battle specifically because it will keep morale up.

Hornblower seems doubtful the Americans will be successful, but wishes them luck. Commodore Edward Preble would become famous for his blockade of Tripoli during the First Barbary War, which featured, among other things, a daring boarding action to burn the captured USS <em>Philadelphia</em> and an overland Marine expedition from Egypt to lay siege to the city with a mercenary army.</li><li> The plot of <em>Commodore Hornblower</em> is about Napoleon's plan to invade Russia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Wonder how that one will go</a>.</li><li> Basically any well-known historical event can be seen that way.

Still, women fall in love with him with astonishing rapidity. The first description of him is with a face "neither handsome nor ugly," however, and Lady Barbara considers him to be good-looking, so it's possible he's as bad at evaluating his looks as much as any other aspect of himself.

On one occasion it's mandated to get around the problem of Mr Bush being junior to a borrowed lieutenant who's acting as a subordinate on a mission, but Hornblower does it at several points without such issues. He hates relying on other's assessments or abilities and fear of being a coward also impels him to do things himself whenever possible. That's why he gets soaked to the skin personally clambering around a harbor boom in <em>Commodore</em> instead of just letting his young lieutenants do the recon and report back, among other things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor">Master Actor</a>: Hornblower can put on the appearance of a scowling, bloodthirsty tyrant as easily as putting on a hat; he can conceal his fatigue and human doubts behind an imperturbable mask just as easily.

To Wellard, it's more ambiguous&mdash;Bush thinks it could be telling the kid to get to it before Buckland vacillates, but it could also mean that a secret (about you-know-what) is still safe. It's also mentioned (before Sawyer's fall) when Hornblower is clearly <em>avoiding</em> these to prevent any appearance of collusion.</li><li> In <em>Commodore</em>, Hornblower can't order Mound to follow him out of the Czar's reception as it would arouse suspicion, instead giving the lieutenant a Look with as much meaning as he can put into it so that Mound will help him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">foil Braun's attempt to assassinate the Czar</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: Inverted.

In <em>The Happy Return</em>, much of the book is driven by Hornblower's orders to support an uprising against the Spanish in Central America, specifying that he was not to be in sight of land before he got there. Because he follows this instruction, he doesn't learn that England and Spain formed an alliance until <em>after</em> he captures the only Spanish warship in the area and gives it (along with other materiel) to the rebels... forcing him to go out and fight the battle all over again or have his career ruined just for following orders to the letter.

The Comte de Gra&ccedil;ay mentions that he does not care about a trinket of the tyrant, but he would like to have a memento of his son returned when most convenient.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>: Admiral Lord Collingwood, Hornblower's superior in <em>Hornblower and the Atropos</em>.

Hornblower simply expresses surprise at how high rats are going for compared to when he was a midshipman. (Midshipman Hornblower could never actually bring himself to eat rat, but he's familiar enough to feign it as a ploy to make himself more human in their eyes.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Atropos</em>, Hornblower scares away a Spanish ship bigger then his by sailing towards it to while signalling to his nonexistent backup.</li><li> Hornblower takes two Spanish ships in separate <em>Midshipman</em> stories by this method as well.

Hornblower arranges a series of perfectly harmless coincidences so that Doughty is unrestrained (because an official is coming aboard and the new steward can't handle it), unguarded (Hornblower has to deal with said official), and makes sure the watch's attention is directed forward. When Bush notices Doughty's absence, Hornblower puts him off until it's certain that Doughty is irretrievable and only then does he take himself to task for his "carelessness."

It's the kind of work that his little sloop seems made for, being smaller and nimbler so that the French ship can't shake him unless it turns and fights, which its mission doesn't allow.

The boat is later set adrift somehow during the fight, meaning that even if he wasn't killed by the hit, he would have certainly died at sea.</li><li> Other instances of this, such as sandbagging the dock sentries in <em>Hotspur</em> during the attack on the semaphore, strongly imply fatality rather than a nap for however long the plot dictates.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a>: Near the end of "Midshipman", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hornblower attends a banquet where a toast is made to the hope of the Spanish fleet leaving Cadiz.

Later, when he has escaped and faces the prospect of a mandatory court-martial for losing his ship, he decides to "fly his colours to the last" and responds to an English ship's inquiry in an entirely routine, yet fantastically unbelievable, manner.

However, narration <em>during</em> battles tends to be clear and only harried about dealing with tactical and shiphandling problems; it's usually in hindsight or anticipation that Hornblower thinks about the danger. This is particularly true with the howitzer shell in <em>Hotspur</em> when his narration explicitly points out that there's no time to think before he dives for it without a mention of the "bloody rags" he envisioned once he'd dealt with it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>: In "The Spanish Galleys", Hornblower's success is due in large part to how morally outraged he and his men are by witnessing the hellish condition that the galley-slaves are kept in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>: Marie (not Maria) points out that he is a very easy man for women to love but a man who finds it hard to love in return. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's mostly right.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedSpouse">Unwanted Spouse</a>: Horatio essentially marries Maria out of guilt because he can't bear to hurt her feelings when she throws herself at him.

They pay his winnings while saying they're still indebted to him for his skillful playing, and then place him in command of a sloop by sunrise.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>: In <em>Hornblower in the West Indies</em>, Hornblower meets a colleague he not seen since the defense of Riga in 1812, chronicled in <em>Commodore</em>, which the narration states occurred twenty years prior. <em>West Indies</em> takes place in 1821-23 and crucially involves Napoleon's death in 1821, only a decade after Napoleon's invasion of Russia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontWantToCatchThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontWantToCatchThis">You Don't Want to Catch This</a>: The turncoat privateer in <em>Commodore</em> poses as the captain of the ship he's just captured and claims that they're infected with smallpox to keep <em>Nonsuch</em> away. It almost works, but Hornblower calls his bluff since the yells from belowdecks sound more like shouting for help than overloud fever rambling.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">Your Costume Needs Work</a>: Admiral Hornblower (Ret.) privately concludes that the man claiming to be Napoleon is a fraud and/or madman because the man is too tall, has the wrong accent, and dresses like a (wet) dandy rather than in any way to call to mind the tyrant, who Hornblower knew died two and a half decades earlier. The man turns out to be Napoleon III, Napoleon's nephew.</li></ul><hr>
