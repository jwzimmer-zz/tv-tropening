He finds her repulsive for no other reason than that she has hairy wrists; ignoring her mother's advice to just buy her a razor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: <em>The Wilderness Years</em> raises the possibility that Glenn's real father might be someone other than Adrian (quite possibly Barry Kent.) Later books never raise this issue again and from <em>The Cappuccino Years</em> on Glenn is permanently a big part of Adrian's life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdPhobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdPhobia">Absurd Phobia</a>: In <em>Cappuccino Years</em>, Adrian reveals his fear of netting, which stems from his babyhood, when his parents used netting to imprison him in his cot at night. He says that he has never been able to enjoy watching tennis for this reason.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Adrian's parents border on neglectful, although it is played for laughs.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics">Antiquated Linguistics</a>: Adrian sometimes uses slightly old-fashioned expressions. For example, he nearly always says "lavatory" rather than "toilet", even in the later books. When speaking on Radio 4 in <em>True Confessions</em>, he tells listeners that he will make particular reference to his "toilet habits", meaning his washing routine, which probably caused some listeners to chuckle. Another expression is "postmistress".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: Everyone around Adrian seems to get success in something he wishes he could have, almost to the point of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>:<ul><li> Pandora. Beautiful, witty, Head Girl of her school, doctorate from Oxford, fluent in at least five languages, MP and published author, to list just a few of her achievements.</li><li> Brett Mole is a widely acclaimed author, filmmaker, ladies' man, millionaire stock trader, wit and almost everything Adrian would like to be ... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Brett loses his money during the 2008 recession.</span></li><li> Barry Kent could be considered this as well, since he becomes a widely admired poet...much to Adrian's consternation, as he believes Barry cannot read and Adrian desperately wants to be recognized as a genius poet (or recognized as being ANYTHING wonderful, for that matter). To twist the knife further, one of Barry's books is based heavily on Adrian.</li><li> After having been a housewife and mother to a large family for many years, Barry's mother Edna graduates with <em>two</em> first-class degrees, begins a successful career in middle age, and wins awards for her academic papers while Adrian's own life is falling apart. He's stunned.</li><li> Inverted by Brain Box Henderson. He should be this, having been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> in the early books, but ends up working in a fairly mundane job at an electronics shop. Hilariously, he's jealous of <em>Adrian</em>, because Adrian is more successful with women than he is (though, Adrian notes that he can count the number of women he's slept with on one hand). Adrian uses this to his advantage to pawn Marigold off on him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingYourIntellectualAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingYourIntellectualAge">Acting Your Intellectual Age</a>: Adrian, in believing himself to be an intellectual, often comes across as older than he really is. His mother notes that he "came out of the womb at 35", he tends to get along best with the elderly, and is diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively young age. However, in <em>Cappuccino Years</em>, he wishes "that everyone over the age of fifty would commit mass suicide, and give the rest of us a break".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: Bert Baxter, Martin Muffet, Pamela Pigg, Wayne Wong.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is that someone else always ends up succeeding at something that Adrian would like to be. Pandora and Barry Kent are notable examples; Pandora becomes a celebrated academic, who gets elected as a member of Parliament, while Barry is a successful poet and author. Inverted with Brain Box Henderson, who is jealous of Adrian's apparent success with women.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">Ambiguous Gender</a>:<ul><li> In order to go to see his current crush, who works at a creche, Adrian borrows one of the neighbours' young children. He doesn't know the child's name and is not sure of their gender, so books them into the creche under the name Emily. He's banned from the creche when the staff had to change the child's nappy and discovered they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">certainly aren't an Emily.</a></li><li> Adrian is unable to determine the genders of his landlord's three children in <em>The Wilderness Years</em>. Tamsin is a girl's name, but Griffith is usually a surname and the third kid is named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">Alpha</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>: The famous Airfix glue incident. Adrian tried sniffing glue from a model aeroplane and it stuck to his nose.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">And Now for Someone Completely Different</a>: <em>True Confessions</em> starts off with Adrian, before jumping to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Sue</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Townsend</a> herself around the halfway mark and the tail end of the book is the diary of a young girl named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Hilda Roberts</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsPlot">April Fools' Plot</a>: Adrian is constantly hit with April Fool's gags, mostly involving someone making him believe that a publisher wants to pick up one of his works. Adding to this, April Fool's Day happens to be the day before Adrian's birthday.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>: At one point, Adrian goes to see a psychotherapist who engages him in an exercise to pretend that a chair is his father and tell "him" why he has disappointed Adrian. The therapist encourages Adrian to be angrier, but he's already said everything he could think of to say, and continues with "... you didn't buy me an anglepoise lamp when I was revising for my GCSEs, and I hate your Country 'n' Western cassettes"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>: <em>The Lost Diaries of Adrian Mole</em> features Sue Townsend as an actual character, whom Adrian believes is stalking him and trying to pass off his diaries as her own works of fiction. She also appears in <em>True Confessions</em>, where the opening blurb explains that Adrian sued her for this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a>: In universe, when Adrian's mother writes Adrian's cookbook, she includes a bizarre and completely irrelevant chapter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">on gender politics</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>: Brown, Adrian's boss at the Department Of The Environment, is a petty bureaucrat who makes hell for Adrian (and, to a lesser extent, everyone else). He's obsessed with nailing Adrian for stealing postage stamps and doesn't even give him his statutory rights when Adrian's resignation letter (which he wasn't going to submit, having got cold feet) somehow finds its way to him. Adrian suspects that he cares more about the Newport Pagnell newts than he does about his subordinates.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomStallGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomStallGraffiti">Bathroom Stall Graffiti</a>: In <em>Growing Pains</em>, Adrian gets sent to the headmaster's office for writing a poem in the boys' toilet. When Adrian asks the headmaster how he knows he's the culprit, he replies, "You signed it, idiot boy."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardnessProtectionProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardnessProtectionProgram">Beardness Protection Program</a>: In the second book, Adrian runs away from home and tries to grow a beard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow">Beard of Sorrow</a>: Adrian has a beard during <em>The Wilderness Years</em>, a notable emotional low point for him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Benevolent Boss</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Mr. Carlton-Hayes</a>, Adrian's employer in the last two books, is the only person Adrian ever worked for who wasn't a pen-pushing bureaucrat or a total nutter. When Adrian finds himself in financial trouble in <em>The Weapons Of Mass Destruction</em>, Mr. Carlton-Hayes gives Adrian a payrise to help him cope and any time Adrian needs time off for personal matters, always gives him the time he needs. When the bookshop is forced to close in <em>The Prostrate Years</em>, Adrian is devastated at the thought of not seeing him every day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a>: The Flowers sisters, Marigold and Daisy, during the events of <em>The Weapons Of Mass Destruction</em> occupy the roles respectively; Marigold is meek and weird, while Daisy is more confident about her sexuality, owing to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpicyLatina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpicyLatina">Mexican heritage</a>. Before Daisy comes along, Pandora could also be considered the Veronica, as she and Adrian almost get together after their school reunion until Marigold messes it up for Adrian.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a>: When Rosie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> falls pregnant</span>, Adrian notes that he wants to beat the guy who was responsible. As it stands, he's the one who helps her out when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she gets an abortion</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition">Birth/Death Juxtaposition</a>: In <em>The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole</em>, elderly Queenie dies shortly after Adrian's sister is born, and he reflects at her funeral that she had to die in order to "make way" for the baby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: Most of the books tend to end this way, most notably <em>The Wilderness Years</em> where Adrian has lost Bianca and his flat is burgled, but starts a new relationship with Jo Jo and a possible career as a chef and <em>The Prostrate Years</em> where Daisy leaves him, but he may have gotten back with Pandora.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>: There are some elements of this in the books, such as the deaths of Ivan Braithwaite and the Moles' dog.

This doll cries at unpredictable hours, has to be fed every four hours with an electronic bottle, and may sound an alarm if roughly handled. Said doll is unsettlingly realistic, and looks like a prettier William Hague. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when the following happens:<ul><li> When the doll arrives, they discover it is of indeterminate sex.

He sent a character on a day trip to China (...from England) who walked around on the Great Wall because that's all he knew about the place. In addition, Adrian's perpetually mixing up names of all branches of the arts (claiming Rupert Blake wrote "The Tyger", for example)<ul><li> Also, in the first book, he thinks that the Sistine Chapel was painted by Rembrandt in Venice. He finds <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> old-fashioned and thinks that Austen "should write something a bit more modern". He also does not know why someone named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">"Pandora" would have the nickname "Box".</a> In the second book, he thinks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvelynWaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvelynWaugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> was a woman and confuses Kingsley Amis with Kingsley Martin.</li><li> The author herself does this sometimes, too. In one book, Adrian's younger sister becomes a Goth. Townsend seems to have this idea that Goth is some sort of cult rather than a subculture, since Rosie does not wash after this and prays to a callous "Goth god". (Or maybe the joke here is that Rosie, not Townsend, has no clue what a Goth really is.) In <em>The Cappuccino Years</em>, Adrian is described as being almost knocked off his feet by "Sarah Brightman's opening shrieks" when he plays a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em> CD too loudly - but Christine, the character played by Brightman, doesn't sing in the opening of the show.</li><li> A newspaper proclaims Barry Kent's 45 year old father as a burly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> veteran.

However, as someone who grew up in Leicester, this could be a poke at the local newspaper which has a habit of getting these things wrong. In the second book, a newspaper gives Adrian's age as 5, her mother's age as 58, and mispells their surname as "Vole".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>: Eleanor Flood tells Adrian that her father died when a small dog fell off a balcony and hit him on the head.

However, as the series goes on, his friends and family lose their patience with and tolerance of him; admittedly he brings some of it on himself, but at times they're quite openly hostile or nasty towards him, which is a bit jarring compared to earlier books. Additionally, while some of his complaining still comes off as immature <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Six years later when <em>The Cappuccino Years</em> starts he's gone through a bitter divorce, been left a struggling single parent, is back to be hopelessly in awe of Pandora, is a notoriously poor chef, and his writing career is no closer to getting anywhere.<ul><li> This happens again between <em>The Weapons of Mass Destruction</em> and <em>The Prostrate Years</em>: at the end of the former, Adrian is married to Daisy, they have a baby daughter and he seemingly gives up diary-writing because 'happy people don't keep a diary'.

Instead of realising how incredibly self-absorbed he is, though, he simply wonders if Jack the Ripper's wife was similarly naive about her husband's activities.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSequel">Immediate Sequel</a>: <em>Growing Pains</em> begins the day after <em>Secret Diary</em> ends.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInaccurate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInaccurate">Innocent Inaccurate</a>: Played for laughs in the first book; Adrian completely fails to pick up the obvious signs of his mother's affair with Mr. Lucas.

She is noted to be attractive in the second book, but just a couple of years later has put on weight. In <em>The Cappuccino Years</em>, Adrian notes that she had nice breasts at eighteen, but at thirty, his description of them is a lot less flattering. In the tv series, he is visibly shocked at the change.</li><li> Daisy gains quite a bit of weight between the last two books, though she starts to shed it before she leaves Adrian.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>: Several characters, including Adrian himself. He comes off as rather jerky when we read his inside thoughts, but he'd pretty much stick up for anyone he cares about. Adrian's parents are basically neglectful but do actually love Adrian.<ul><li> Daisy comes off as being very brash and hedonistic, but she's easily the least self-centered of the Flowers family. She shows interest in Adrian's life rather than making everything about herself, and asks him about his son in the army. She's also very friendly towards Adrian's parents.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">Kafka Komedy</a>: There's a distinct element of this.

Another list appears in <em>Prostrate Years</em>, from Daisy.</li><li> At the beginning of <em>Cappuccino Years</em>, all the characters are listed, including those who only appear briefly, for the benefit of the reader.</li><li> In <em>Cappuccino Years</em>, his employer Savage displays a long list of what is banned from the restaurant, including (to name but a few):<div class="indent"> No Welsh</div><div class="indent"> No mobile phones</div><div class="indent"> No comedians</div><div class="indent"> No lesbians</div><div class="indent"> No handbags with bamboo handles</div><div class="indent"> No children</div></li><li> In <em>Weapons of Mass Destruction</em>, a staggeringly long list of his financial outgoings, and his creditors.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">Love Makes You Crazy</a>: Eleanor Flood, who resorts to stalking Adrian and eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">burns his (non-insured) house down.</span> Adrian has bordered on this himself with some of his own love interests.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">Lower-Class Lout</a>: Barry and all the Kent family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision">Ludicrous Precision</a>: Adrian occasionally quotes his age in full, such as "I had my first proper hangover aged fourteen years, five months and nine days". The full title of the first book, <em>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged Thirteen and Three-Quarters</em> reflects this. He usually quotes prices in full, including pence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeInCountryX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeInCountryX">Made in Country X</a>: Adrian says in <em>Secret Diary</em> that his birthday presents were the usual Japanese rubbish, although he did get a model aeroplane that was made in West Germany. Note also this scene from the great Teletubby toy shortage:<div class="indent"> I asked where the Teletubbies were to be found. The shop assistant said "in China, sir, where they make 'em". He said they'd had a few Laa-Laas on Monday, but they'd gone within minutes. I asked why we couldn't manufacture Teletubbies in this country.

Adrian notes that none of those people come out again, and his mother remarks that they probably have gas chambers out there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a>: Adrian's classmate "Brain-Box" Henderson, who reappears as an adult in <em>Weapons of Mass Destruction</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Teen Pregnancy</a>: Rosie is pregnant in <em>The Cappuccino Years</em>, and confides this to Adrian, who makes her care for a role-playing electronic doll (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll">Creepy Doll</a> above).<div class="indent"> I did all the traditional things: hand to forehead, said "Oh my God".

Adrian's section of <em>True Confessions</em> starts off while he's still in school and has sporadic entries over a number of years, noting Adrian's post O Level schooling and the beginning of his subsequent employment at the Department Of The Environment. <em>Weapons Of Mass Destruction</em> features a time skip of a year after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Robbie's death</span> during which Adrian has sold his Rat Wharf flat, gotten back with Daisy, moved into the spare converted pigsty that his parents have bought, and had a daughter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap">The Baby Trap</a>: Marigold tries this on Adrian, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but turns out to have been faking it.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTopicOfCancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTopicOfCancer">The Topic of Cancer</a>: Adrian suffers from prostate cancer in <em>The Prostrate Years</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: Daisy, Marigold and Poppy Flowers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed">There Is Only One Bed</a>: Many years after they had ended their sexual relationship, Adrian and Sharon Bott are forced to sleep in the same bed for a night.

Pandora, Daisy and Pamela Pigg are all from wealthy upper-middle-class families (with Adrian writing to an agony aunt at one point because he fears class will keep him and Pandora apart.) Adrian's first wife, Jo Jo, is a titled aristocrat in her native Nigeria. Interestingly Adrian is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">himself</a></em> one of these for Sharon Bott (in Adrian's words he is "upper-working/lower-middle class", she is "lower-working/underclass".)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode">Villain Episode</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Margaret Thatcher</a> is given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> in the third book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a>: Adrian laughs on hearing that William has changed his name to Wole in honour of his Nigerian stepfather and become "Wole Mole."

When he covets a grey zip-up cardigan from Marks and Spencer's (Adrian's preferred clothes shop, along with charity shop Oxfam), his mother accuses him of looking like a sixteen-year-old Frank Bough (veteran TV presenter). In <em>Wilderness Years</em>, Adrian wears a Royal British Legion blazer, to much ridicule. In <em>True Confessions</em>, he describes his outfit to Radio 4 listeners, detailing his balaclava helmet, lucky cravat, purposely odd socks, and training shoes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: A key theme in <em>Weapons of Mass Destruction</em>, as seen through Glenn's experiences in Iraq, involving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of his best friend Robbie.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenIWasYourAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenIWasYourAge">When I Was Your Age...</a>: When Adrian buys himself new pyjamas for hospital because the old ones are too childish, his father says that when he was a kid, he slept in a nightshirt made out of two coal sacks stitched together.<div class="indent">I phoned my grandma to check this suspicious statement and my father was forced to repeat it down the phone.

In the following book, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool">is working at a roadside burger van</a> before finally settling into working at a bookshop.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenDrivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenDrivers">Women Drivers</a>: Tania Braithwaite is a mild example in that she refuses to drive above 30 mph.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a>: Bianca Dartington is a qualified hydraulic engineer, albeit reduced to working in a newsagents and then as a waitress.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow">Write Who You Know</a>: In universe, "Aiden Vole" from Barry Kent's highly successful novel, <em>Dork's Diary</em>, is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of Adrian.<ul><li> Which also makes Barry Kent into something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>. The books actually exist in universe, written by Sue Townsend, whom Adrian thinks is stalking him, stealing his journals, and passing them off as her own work. (His memory is bad enough for him to really think this, even if events are only vaguely similar.)</li><li> Adrian tries this with his own novel, basing characters on people he knows and puts his protagonist into similar situations to the ones he's just witnessed. For example, when he hears that Barry Kent has written a character based on him, he adds a character named Kent Barry to <em>Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland</em> purely out of spite, who is stated to be a failed writer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>: Eleanor Flood develops an obsession with Adrian, believing them to be in a relationship when they're not.
