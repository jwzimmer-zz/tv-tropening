It started in 1994 with the publishing of <em>Wizard's First Rule</em> and ended in 2007 with the eleventh in the series and final book of the <em>Chainfire</em> trilogy, <em>Confessor</em>. There is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> novella, originally published in the <em>Legends</em> compilation of short stories and now available on its own, called <em>Debt of Bones</em>.

After coming upon an "odd-looking vine", he spots a mysterious and beautiful woman who appears to be chased by four armed men. Offering to help her, he finds she is being trailed by assassins.<p>She explains that she has come in search of a great wizard, who supposedly came to Westland years ago, to help defend the Midlands against a man named Darken Rahl, who hopes to bring all the world under his dominion. Richard knows that what she says is impossible; nothing can get through the boundaries, and Westland doesn't have any magic. Yet he has never seen a woman like her, nor men like those hunting her. He decides he should take her to Zedd, a slightly crazy old man who is like a grandfather to him, and who always seems to know everything that goes on...</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>As you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist">might have guessed</a>, Zedd does, indeed, turn out to be the wizard, and the three characters team up to stop Darken Rahl before all is lost. Richard is given the titular Sword of Truth, which uses the power of its user's personal anger to strike down enemies.</p><p>The two first books, <em>Wizard's First Rule</em> and <em>Stone of Tears</em>, are fairly standard fantasy fare, complete with dragons, an evil wizard out to rule the world, the discovery that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">wasn't working for his own sake</a>, a potentially world-ending plot, a magic sword, a wise old wizard, a mysterious woman with strange powers, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">gratuitous S&amp;M sequence</a>. For a long time some people thought Goodkind was ripping off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Robert Jordan</a>, as his stories contained many things that had exact counterparts in Jordan's novels. From the third book on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerivativeDifferentiation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerivativeDifferentiation">things get slightly less derivative</a>, with the introduction of a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and increasing focus on Richard's struggles as a leader. By the fourth book the plot is still pretty standard but at least going under its own power.</p><p>Around the fifth book, Goodkind began introducing overtly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism">Objectivist</a> themes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">aesops</a> inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a> in the Sword of Truth. Things went overboard in the eighth book, <em>Naked Empire</em>, which contains the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">evil pacifist</a> plot. The last three books, collectively called the Chainfire Trilogy, brought back plenty of the early themes and events of the series, and <em>Confessor</em>, the last book, was specifically one huge throw-back to <em>Wizard's First Rule</em>.</p><p>Goodkind has stated a distaste for cliffhangers and other ways of forcing people to buy future books, which is why, aside from the Chainfire trilogy, the books have mostly self-contained plots; some new danger is introduced, the characters wonder about its meaning, and it is defeated. However, all of these book-plots are tied by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the Imperial Order</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Keeper of the Underworld</a>.</p><p>There's also a spin-off book, <em>The Law of Nines</em>, which follows a completely different cast of characters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">shifts genres</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">a contemporary thriller with fantasy elements</a>. It takes place in the magic-free world created at the end of "Confessor", the inhabitants of which developed technology to replace the magic they had lost. The story follows the exploits of Alex Rahl, a distant descendant of Richard's half-sister Jennsen, whose life is changed forever when he meets a woman named Jax who claims to be from a parallel universe where magic still works.</p><p>Now has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SwordOfTruth">character sheet</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This series provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceOfEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceOfEvidence">Absence of Evidence</a>: In <em>Chainfire</em>, after the eponymous spell has made everyone forget that Kahlan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">ever existed</a>, Richard tries to use this to convince everyone else that she has. He points to where he says he, Kahlan, and Cara had been walking, and notes that there were no footprints between his and Cara's, which were several feet apart. He tells his companions that this means someone erased Kahlan's footprints. Nobody believes him since, as mentioned, everyone is sure that she never existed in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Three examples occur in the series. Darken Rahl <em>kills</em> all of his children who he knew about, since none had magic (he wanted a gifted heir). Oba's mother does nothing but belittle him that we see, and this may be why he has an utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> (though his birth father Darken Rahl displays the same trait). Nicci's mother was entirely unsympathetic to her daughter's needs, and even hit her when Nicci came for comfort over being frightened by a beggar, saying she should accept this. She demanded utter self-denial and service to others from Nicci, which left her a self-loathing mess for years to come. This explains why she served the Keeper and then the Imperial Order, since both fed into this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAthlete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAthlete">Accidental Athlete</a>: Richard gets conscripted into a Ja'La team after he slaughters his way through a considerable number of soldiers in an almost-successful attempt to free himself.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>: The Bandakar initially, who fall under the rule of the Imperial Order due to this. Most of them later abandon pacifism and kill fight with Richard's guidance.

How the real-world names (with histories and etymologies that are incompatible at best with the fictional languages and cultures of the setting) ended up in this world is never addressed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: The D'Haran guards at the People's Palace during the first book. While they're there to guard Darken Rahl and, ostensibly, Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and Chase are the enemy, Darken Rahl believes they're no longer a threat to him, so the guards are just polite and friendly, even going so far as offering Richard a horse and giving him directions and advice on what road to take when he leaves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance">Age-Gap Romance</a>: Warren and Verna are actually both the same age, but due to Warren spending more time in a spell that slows aging, he looks much younger.

It's broken even before that, since Richard's explicit superpower is that things come to him without any effort (most obviously magic, but it's implied that everything from his skill with a bow to sculpture are just handed to him for free by the universe with no training, practice, etc. required).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherhoodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherhoodOfEvil">Brotherhood of Evil</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">gender flipped</a> example: the Sisters of the Dark in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth">The Sword of Truth</a></em>, an organization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">evil sorcerers</a> within the Sisters of the Light secretly serving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">the Keeper</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Brother&#150;Sister Incest</a>: Tobias and Lunetta Brogan apparently have an incestuous relationship, giving her saying she cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">glamours</a> for him in private.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Richard</span> in the last few books of the series... not that he ever really did much with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his magic</span> in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a>: This occurs in the books as well as the series, whenever Kahlan uses her power and in many of Richard's fights, accompanied by the recurring phrases "Time was hers" and "Bringer of death" respectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourDisabled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourDisabled">Bury Your Disabled</a>: When the Imperial Order conquers a city, it's shown they kill a mentally disabled man as he's deemed "useless" (they only keep citizens with useful skills alive as slaves).

They take "mates" from among men to reproduce. Yet this is never called rape, even though after that's done their mates can't refuse to consent. This is particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy">hypocritical</a> as the Confessors are in the "good" camp, while rape is ubiquitously used as a mark of their evil enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeSciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeSciFi">Double Standard: Rape, Sci-Fi</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged">Zigzagged</a> in the series.<ul><li> The glamour spell, the series' equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">love potions</a>, is seen by characters as tantamount to rape.

While that's all problematic enough, it crosses into rape territory because having sex causes them to lose control of their power, Confessing whoever they do it with. This means that there were only two recorded cases of a Confessor able to have a mate who <em>isn't</em> forced to consent with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind control</a>, and these cases were <em>3,000 years apart</em>. Bear in mind that Confessors are on the <em>good</em> side, and this isn't treated as rape.

However it was explicitly said to be a one-way change if the user only has additive magic. Though in theory, Richard could do it.

In their native Nicobarese and then beyond they seek to hunt down all the magic users they can find.

The Imperial Order believes this too, though in their case it's due to some people being gifted while others aren't offending their communist principles.

Many of his friends ask him why he needs a sword when he's a hilariously-powerful wizard. Then the Pristinely Ungifted show up. The Pristinely Ungifted aren't even immune to magic, <em>they have no connection to it whatsoever</em>. To them, magic might as well not exist except when it does something like hold someone off the ground (where they see the person in the air even if they don't understand) and some poorly-defined subset of Subtractive Magic, which they have some connection to because they're mortal.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">The Magocracy</a>:<ul><li> Aidandril is a city ruled by the Mother Confessor, a woman whose touch can make anyone fall so in love with them they'll do whatever they desire.</li><li> D'Hara has been ruled by the House of Rahl for centuries, with all of them being powerful wizards.

They gather over a million troops for an invasion, and later the number swells with reinforcements to 2-3 million.

Zedd deserves special mention, because he's a kindly old man alternating between wise advisor and perky side-quest assistant in the early books, to the point that if you haven't thought too much about the backstory or read Debt of Bones, it can seem like a complete 180 when he suddenly resorts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapons Of Mass Destruction</a>, bio-weapons, and straight-up unapologetic genocide later in the series, as well as being shockingly casual about murder on little provocation even compared to Richard.

"Pristinely Ungifted" offspring of the House of Rahl are historically killed at birth, because of the inherent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> quality they possess, and the fact that any children <em>they</em> have will also be Pristinely Ungifted, meaning that they could potentially wipe out magic entirely.

Male Confessors are much, much stronger than female ones to the point where it becomes impossible to control them; according to the backstory, every one was a complete monster, using their powers to get whatever they wanted, and sparking off decades of war before they were wiped out.

A religious group, the Sisters are worshippers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGood">the Creator</a>, though some within their ranks have now secretly sworn themselves to his mortal enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">the Keeper</a>. They live in the Palace of the Prophets on Halsband Island, a place in the Old World, which is under a spell which slows their aging significantly, so they can live centuries.</li><li> The Mord Sith, a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">female warriors</a> who serve as bodyguards and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">torturers</a> to D'Hara's Lords Rahl, wielding the agiel, a magical weapon capable of causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam">intense pain</a>.

Due to this, they oppose magic as some people have the gift while others don't. In spite of this, their leader and many members are themselves magic users (they justify this as using magic to destroy it). They create an empire under Jagang, a Dreamwalker with the ability to control people's minds, later invading the New World which causes a huge war.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderedToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderedToDie">Ordered to Die</a>:<ul><li> Confessor magic enslaves a person's mind completely, to the extent that powerful ones can order a person to drop dead, and he will.

She and Jedediah, a wizard training in the Palace of the Prophets, had a daughter together (wizards and sorceresses are encouraged to have relationships in hopes that they will produce more gifted people). However, their daughter was ungifted, and thus given to a family outside the Palace to raise. Verna kept in contact with her, but as she was affected with the Palace's anti-aging spell, it means her daughter died from old age as she went on to live many years more.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide">Patricide</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Richard</span> kills his father, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darken Rahl</span>.

The deconstruction comes when the heroes find out that their strict pacifist philosophy extends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalPacifism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalPacifism">even to self-defense in any form</a>. Deviant criminals who've committed murder are attempted to be rehabilitated several times beyond the point of common sense. As a last measure, they subdue the offender and dump him down a cliff that leads outside the boundary as a form of exile. They won't attack or drive off the predatory birds that occasionally fly away with young children. And when the Imperial Order comes to call, the most they offer is a meek protest when its soldiers proceed to kidnap and rape women of all ages in a program of systematic breeding to cultivate their ungifted trait. Even when the heroes attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingThePeacefulVillagers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingThePeacefulVillagers">train them to fight back</a>, the Bandakarans mostly refuse, saying that they have no right to judge the men of the Order as they don't know the circumstances under which they're acting, and try to stop the heroes from fighting with them. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

We then cut to the next chapter, which starts with Nicci telling a child to look into her eyes while cupping her chin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest">Villainous Incest</a>: This is heavily implied to be the case between Tobias and Lunetta Brogan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainessesWantHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainessesWantHeroes">Villainesses Want Heroes</a>: Denna, Nicci, most of the Sisters of the Dark... every evil female character at least attempts to throw themselves at Richard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceReallyIsTheAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceReallyIsTheAnswer">Violence Really Is the Answer</a>: The theme of <em>Naked Empire</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>: The mriswith and sliph were once human, turned into this by ancient wizards to use in war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a>: At one point, Zedd detonates what amounts to a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">magical nuclear bomb</a></em> in the middle of the Imperial Order's ranks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Richard's bodyguards Ulic and Egan disappear entirely without mention after <em>Temple Of The Winds</em>, and their sudden and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">conspicuous reappearance</a> in <em>Confessor</em> seems to suggest Goodkind realized he'd forgotten all about them.

Whenever they face <em>real</em> magic users (as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">muggles</a> they've accused, or sympathizers) they're naturally screwed unless their leader hypocritically uses his sister (a sorceress) to even the odds.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">The Witch Hunter</a>: The Blood of the Fold are an organization of these, who firmly believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsEvil">Magic Is Evil</a> and all magic users are banelings (i.e. serve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Keeper</a>). Similarly the Imperial Order loathes magic because of the inequality it entails, though in the short term both use this out of necessity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a>: While they only actively try to kill the villains, Richard eventually comes to believe that if a person is unwilling to take responsibility for their life into their own hands (read: not an Objectivist), then the life of that person is expendable when it means ensuring the safety of his own people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardBeard">Wizard Beard</a>:<ul><li> Averted/parodied in the first book where First Wizard Zedd has no beard. Midway through the first book, Richard calls him out on this, saying that wizards are supposed to have beards, and <em>everyone knows that</em>. Zedd plays along, and magically grows out a long white beard... then immediately shaves it off, saying he doesn't wear a beard because they're <em>itchy</em>. He can't just remove it himself, because he only has Additive magic.</li><li> Later, it's a plot point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Richard</span> can both grow and remove his own beard &#151; signifying that he can use both Additive and Subtractive magic.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a>: The Palace of the Prophets. Bonus points for being built as a spell-form, preventing the Sorceresses, Wizards, and especially the Prophets from aging, allowing them to accrue truly terrifying amounts of knowledge. Similarly, the Wizards' Keep used to be this, but slowly ran out of Wizards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a>: Brophy is literally a man-sized wolf.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Woman Scorned</a>: Con Dar (see also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>: Every character of plot significance is more than capable of and willing to take out numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, although detractors see it as a World Of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> due to villains tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> and the heroes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">Wouldn't Hit a Girl</a>: Deliberately averted, and for good reason. Richard notes he is quite aware that women can be just as dangerous as men.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: The series began as pretty typical high fantasy, but increasingly became a vessel for the author to express his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism">Objectivist</a> beliefs. For example, the central struggle in <em>Faith of the Fallen</em> is between free market capitalism and socialism. The main character Richard delivers a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">author tracts</a> in which he states Goodkind's Objectivist opinions, which often contradict views the character expressed earlier in the series&#151;or even the story's reality itself, such as claiming that belief in the afterlife is unfounded, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">when Richard has been there and back himself</a>. The afterlife thing is particularly noteworthy, since Goodkind's attempt to justify it is more baffling than any Retcon could be. It is revealed in a later book that since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">the world was devoid of magic for a time</a> the afterlife, magical in nature, has ceased to exist. So now belief in the afterlife is unfounded, even though it could be proven to exist before. This overwhelming change in the world and its profound impact on the human condition is mentioned exactly once, and after that all the characters behave as if they had always lived in a world where there was no life after death... and this <em>still</em> doesn't account for the fact Richard goes to said afterlife years <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">after</a></em> the Chimes deprived the world of magic briefly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongInsultOffence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongInsultOffence">Wrong Insult Offence</a>: In the first book, a mob comes to Zedd's house intending to lynch him because he's a witch. He starts his dialogue with them by asking to clarify whether they want to kill him for sorcery, or simply demean him by calling him a girl.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction">Xenofiction</a>: At one point in <em>Soul of the Fire</em>, the narrative briefly takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfView">Point of View</a> of a horse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate">You Are What You Hate</a>: Tobias Brogan, who not only hates magic and its users, but leads the Blood of the Fold, a group intent on killing them all, himself has the gift. It's a secret his mother and sister kept hidden from him all of his life. The protagonist Richard Rahl is clearly able to recognize Brogan has the gift, confusing Brogan greatly during a discussion on defeating insidious evil, and telling him "Be careful the shadow you chase is not the one you cast." Brogan explicitly does not understand what Richard is hinting at. After he finds out, it drives him mad.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanSeeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanSeeMe">You Can See Me?</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe">You Just Told Me</a>:<ul><li> Used a few times in the first book.</li><li> Also inverted once. A man entreats Richard and Kahlan to follow them, saying it was sent by their friend, the wizard. Richard instinctively asks "Zedd?" and the man responds in the affirmative. But while they're following him, Richard notices something's off, and demands the man tell them their friend's name. The man repeats that it's Zedd, at which point Richard points out he'd know that because Richard told him, and demands the wizard's <em>full</em> name. The man is then revealed as a shapeshifting creature.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillKnowWhatToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillKnowWhatToDo">You Will Know What to Do</a>: Richard often knows instinctively what to do to solve problems or use his powers. It's subverted in the second book, however. Prophecy was counting on Richard grabbing a certain item from Adie's house in the first book because he would have a feeling about it. Instead, the feeling just made Richard uneasy about the item, and he left it right where it was.</li></ul><p></p><hr>
