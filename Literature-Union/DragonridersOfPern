Rather than permanently resort to technological measures, the colonists used genetic engineering to create dragons, a solution compatible with their principles since, like the spaceships that had brought them to Pern, it was technology they could use once, then discard. Using planes to fight Thread would mean living in an industrial society capable of supporting them; dragons could be supported by the idealised medieval society the settlers had wanted. There's also the matter that they'd been warned the planet's resources were "negligible". There's insufficient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalPoorPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalPoorPlanet">metal</a> and fuel for such an industrial society, whether or not they want one.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>, the first Pern novella, "Weyr Search", was published in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Analog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Analog">Analog</a></em>, an adult science fiction magazine edited by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWCampbell">John W. Campbell</a>, in October 1967. She kept writing them for another forty years, though later in collaboration with her son, Todd, who eventually took over the series. She was the first woman writer in history to win the Hugo and Nebula Awards, for "Weyr Search" and the original "Dragonflight" (<em>Analog</em>, December 1967/January 1968).</p><p>Most of the books take place over two thousand years after Pern was first settled, beginning when Thread has been absent for 400 years, ever since most of the dragonriders mysteriously disappeared. Only a handful of people still believe Thread was ever real, and there aren't enough dragons left to fight it if it should return, which it does. Fortunately, it turns out that dragons aren't just fire-breathing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">telepathic teleporters</a>; they can also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>.

There are also several prequels, describing how various aspects of Pern society came to be. Some of the books overlap with each other, covering the same events but following different characters.</p><p>The series initially had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantasy">fantasy</a> feel, with a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> trappings,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0joku');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0joku" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0joku');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If John W.

Not actively vicious, but cold and harshly critical of Robinton to the point where it's hard to tell the difference.</li><li> In <em>Dragonsong</em>, Menolly's father beats her for composing music, and her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">may have deliberately attempted to cripple her hand</a> so she can't play an instrument. She rises above every other hardship in her life, but she <em>never</em> forgives her parents. However, the canon text is explicitly contradictory on whether Menolly's mother did her best and was sad that she couldn't help more, or deliberately let her be crippled.</li><li> Aramina has a very 'my way or the highway' viewpoint, and refuses to try to compromise or understand things from her son's point of view. Eventually he leaves the Hold after they fight and she demands that he make a promise he doesn't want to make.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>: McCaffrey based her dragon riders' personalities and physical characteristics on real-life fighter pilots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Prior to the Ninth Pass, female dragonriders are entirely normal and accepted. During the last Long Interval, however, Benden Weyr devolves to a male-dominated society until Lessa proves beyond any doubt her ability to both command the Weyr and ride her dragon into combat. Later, Mirrim undergoes a similar ordeal as a green dragonrider.<ul><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">background material</a>, Pern society became more patriarchal after the Plague in Moreta's time, as the population reduction forced women to focus more on making and raising babies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot">Adam and Eve Plot</a>: In the short story "Rescue Run", Steve Kimmer and his family are discovered by Pern's would-be rescuers on the Southern Continent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Rather than "repopulate the planet"</a>, they've become an insular clan with strong implications of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">Parental Incest</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">Agony of the Feet</a>: Menolly gets caught out during Threadfall and runs the skin off the bottoms of her feet (after wearing through the soles of her shoes) trying to reach shelter.

Plus, Pern is far enough away from Earth that the night sky would look very different, with none of the familiar constellations. A few references in <em>The Skies of Pern</em> do make it clear that at least some of the same stars are visible, though naturally from a completely different perspective.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensMadeThemDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensMadeThemDoIt">Aliens Made Them Do It</a>:<ul><li> Dragon mating has a profound psychic effect on nearby humans, particularly their bondmates, making a sexual union between their riders near-compulsory. And in the early pages of <em>Dragonquest</em> it's clear that if those two riders are both men, it's still going to happen. Weyr culture has adapted to this situation, so permanent relationships among dragonriders are rare, and even non-Dragonrider Weyrfolk are pretty free sexually. However, a rider's preference can influence their dragon's choice of partner &mdash; witness the fact that Mnementh and Ramoth always mate despite the competition from dozens of other bronzes.</li><li> It's noted in <em>Dragonseye</em> that the riders don't necessarily pair off as the dragons do, but all that needs to happen is that the rider stays near their preferred partner during a mating flight. One character in the book notes that "there are plenty of people interested" in participating when a mating flight is in progress.</li><li> Fire lizards have a similar effect on their humans, although not as compelling. Still, if you own a gold and someone near you owns the only bronzes in the vicinity, and she decides to have a mating flight...you'd better like each other pretty well. In several cases, such as Menolly and Sebell, this leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphabeticalThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphabeticalThemeNaming">Alphabetical Theme Naming</a>: Dragons name themselves at Impression, always with a name that ends in -th: Faranth, Ruth, Mnementh, etc. Why they all seem to hatch instinctively knowing to do this is not explained or even brought up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMasterMakesTheirOwnTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMasterMakesTheirOwnTools">A Master Makes Their Own Tools</a>: AIVAS has each member of the team dissecting Thread make their own tools, despite the presence of a craft guild that could have easily provided enough tools for the team.<ul><li> The Harpers also make their own instruments.

The phosphorus in the firestone reacts with the dragon's stomach acid to produce phosphine (chemical formula PH3), a poison gas that ignites spontaneously upon contact with air. The egg-laying gold dragons aren't allowed to chew firestone because it has the side effect of sterilizing females. In <em>Dragonsdawn</em>, it's revealed that this is a misinterpretation of the actual reason: Greens were genetically tweaked to be sterile regardless of firestone, and queens who try to eat firestone vomit it back up, making it necessary for their riders to use flamethrowers. This tweaking was to match the conservative gender views of the geneticist who did the work: on finding out after her death, the queen riders were <em>not</em> pleased.<ul><li> Though it also protects the only viable females. The greens were meant to be sterile because green firelizards were neglectful mothers at best, with clutches forgotten or destroyed by predators. Golds were much more successful, but this meant they were the ONLY thing keeping the dragon species going (all males could sire clutches of all colors, upping the odds of having a fertile male around.) Risking them in any way meant risking everyone's survival, as Benden Weyr found out by the start of the Ninth Pass when the survival of the entire species hinged on one egg (Ramoth's, luckily.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">Bring My Brown Pants</a>: Discussed by riders in <em>Dragonseye</em> who are about to face the first Threadfall in two hundred years.<ul><li> Invoked by the riders in <em>Dragonsdawn</em>, after their first (unplanned) flight <em>between.</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a>:<ul><li> Lessa.

While he never gets over the pain of losing his dragon, he presses on through life by engaging in other pursuits. First by being a Weaver, then by dedicating himself to making Ruatha Hold prosperous again for his ward Jaxom, whom he treats as a son (albeit in a distant fashion).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyToAllLivingThings">Enemy to All Living Things</a>: Thread eats its way through anything organic &mdash; being tied out during threadfall is the single most dire punishment that a criminal can be sentenced to. <em>Drowned</em> Thread OTOH (Thread can't survive in water) is a rich food source for marine life. While the rest of Pern suffers due to Thread, fish and other sea animals thrive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> later on, when it is discovered that Thread is actually only a small part of an extremely complex ecology of space-born lifeforms in Pern's Oort cloud. Presumably, its effects on Pern are an accidental side effect rather than its normal life cycle, since thread on Pern is stranded with no way to get back or reproduce. There's even a brief discussion of the ethics of causing the extinction of Thread, since this will disrupt the oort cloud ecology, but they quickly decide to go through with it anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Epigraph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Epigraph">Epigraph</a>: The early Pern books have snippets of Harper songs at the start of each chapter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEnglish">Eternal English</a>: Over 2500 years on Pern have introduced a lingual shift despite the best efforts of the Harpers. However, the shift is not so severe that, allowing for the loss of context, they cannot understand the language of their ancestors. Documents and recordings from the colonists are still understandable to modern characters (though some of the context has been lost). After being unburied, AIVAS is able to rapidly adjust its language to make itself understood. The dolphins underwent a similar linguistic shift, mostly becoming simpler and filled with abbreviations (for instance, the "blood fish" that attach themselves to the dolphins' undersides like leeches became "bluufis").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLuddite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLuddite">Evil Luddite</a>: The Abominators, a group of people who distrusted the rediscovered technology that was introduced into Pern society by AIVAS during the Ninth Pass and considered AIVAS itself an abomination that was threatening their way of life. The first group successfully kidnapped MasterHarper Robinton, intending to use him as a hostage and only releasing him if AIVAS was destroyed, but they were ultimately captured and exiled (and their actions hastened Robinton's own death). A second group appeared several years later during <em>The Skies of Pern</em>, trying to destroy the new Crafthalls that had come into being as a result of the reintroduced technologies, but they were rendered mostly defunct when their leader tried to invade AIVAS' main chamber (again, as he'd been part of the first group) and was killed by the still active defenses.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary">Evil Reactionary</a>: The Abominators in <em>The Skies of Pern</em>, while primarily Evil Luddites, also qualify for this trope as their efforts to destroy Aivas and anything he restored to Pern are motivated by their desire to keep things as they were before, feeling that any changes will destroy their traditional values and way of life, and that permanently destroying Thread was a bad idea because the threat it posed kept Pern's people working together. As such, they resort to the Evil Luddite method, trying to destroy or prevent the use of anything Aivas shared, in order to turn society back to the way it was before Aivas was discovered. This includes attacking the new Crafthalls founded more recently, since they're based on Aivas' teachings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNamingConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNamingConvention">Fantastic Naming Convention</a>:<ul><li> A common naming convention among Weyrborn is to have the first half of one parent's name combined with the second half of the other's (modifying the end to the appropriate gender, adding '-n' or '-a'). In this way, you have Falloner and Lorana giving Falarnon, and Falloner and Manora giving Famanoran.</li><li> When a male rider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider">Impresses</a>, they shorten their name and contract the first syllable. The first dragonriders noticed their dragons clipped their riders' names, so adopted the practice, first as the equivalent to a pilot call sign, then more formally to aid communication during combat; later it became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticHonorifics">honorific</a>. One conversation notes that mothers in the weyr plan for this, choosing names for boys that are easily contracted.<ul><li> Falloner becomes F'lon, Falarnon becomes F'lar, and Famanoran becomes F'nor.</li><li> One of the things that distinguishes Jaxom of Rutha Hold as <em>not</em> a Dragonrider is that he does not receive the honorific. Although before that decision was made, Lessa amuses herself by wondering his name might be shortened to since&mdash;not being weyr-born&mdash;his name was never designed with contraction in mind.</li></ul></li><li> For the dragons themselves, each one has a single personal name, which always ends in "th".</li><li> In Todd McCaffrey's books from the 3rd Pass, it is revealed that watchwher have their own naming convention. Their names end in '-sk', with the first part taken from the name of the person or bloodline they are linked to. The closer the bond, the more of their name taken.<ul><li> The watchwher for Fort Hold is Forsk.</li><li> Nuella's first, green, watchwher renames herself to Nuelsk when she transfers her bond from Kindan.

Several characters learn to survive holdless simply by hiding in caves. Menolly notes that most of the time very little Thread actually gets to the surface thanks to the dragonriders.<ul><li> Losing their bondmates is this for dragons/dragonriders.

This might be a problem exclusive to dragonriders - being the result of their telepathic bond with their dragon effectively becoming duplicated - as a number of non-dragonriders in Todd McCaffrey's books avoid this trauma when travelling through time, and Masterharper Zist even talks to his past self outright with no issue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">New Powers as the Plot Demands</a>: In <em>The Skies of Pern</em>, the dragons "discover" their powers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a>.

She's from the ruling Ruathan family, and they're supposed to have such gifts. Several great Weyrleaders down through history, male and female, have been Ruathan.

There's also a mention in <em>Dragonsinger</em>, which parallels <em>Dragonquest</em> in the Harper Hall trilogy: Menolly's fire lizards, while shut inside the Harper Hall refectory during Threadfall, get very excited and are described as making the motions of "licking Thread from the air."</li><li> In <em>Sky Dragons</em>, Green Dragons produce eggs, as they never consumed firestone, and one of them lays a gold. Prior to this, green fire-lizard clutches only ever produced lower-ranked colors.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies</a>: Todd McCaffrey's books tend to end with the antagonist (and/or most of his cohorts) getting slaughtered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">Samus Is a Girl</a>: When Petiron submitted Menolly's songs to the Harperhall, he neglected to mention that they were written by a girl. When Petiron died, the Hall scrambled, attempting to find the boy who wrote those lovely songs. When they find Menolly, the general reaction is exasperation that Petiron thought Robinton would be reluctant to let a girl become a Harper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientCetaceans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientCetaceans">Sapient Cetaceans</a>: The original settlers brought intellectually enhanced dolphins with them, but lost contact after the exodus to the Northern Continent. In the aptly titled <em>Dolphins of Pern</em>, Jayge and Aramina's son Readis becomes the first to reestablish contact with the "shipfish".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareDare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareDare">Scare Dare</a>: Robinton has to spend the night in an abandoned Weyr as an unofficial rite of passage among Harpers. Due to his previous experiences with Benden Weyr, he's unimpressed: they actually have to run around shouting to find him, since he's comfortably asleep in one of the heated caves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFantasy">Science Fantasy</a>: One of the classic unclassifiables. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">McCaffrey</a> has always contended that her books are Science Fiction, not Fantasy. Her reasoning is that everything in the books is (in her estimation, at least), scientifically backed.<ul><li> <em>Weyr Search</em>, the first story, and the two-part <em>Dragonflight</em>, were initially published in 1967 and 1968 in <em>Analog</em>, a prestigious science fiction magazine. Editor John W. Campbell had extremely strict standards, so Anne's belief that the stories are Sci Fi has confirmation from what was then the highest authority.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">Science Is Bad</a>: The Pern colony was founded on the principle of rejecting reliance on high technology to solve problems. Millennia later, this sentiment bestirs itself in the form of a violently Luddite group that attempts to sabotage anything related to AIVAS. AIVAS' discovery, however, is what eventually leads to the final end of Thread on Pern.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense of Scale</a>: Distances seem to change at the plot's convenience, and either dragons in the Ninth Pass are ludicrously huge (bronzes and golds being much bigger than <em>blue whales</em>) or someone said "meters" when they meant "feet."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">Selective Obliviousness</a>: Petiron completely ignored his son when Robinton was growing up, and expected him to be skilled with music despite never paying any attention or trying to help Robinton develop his skills. When he finally realised that Robinton was a musical genius whose compositions were being widely played, he was furious that everyone had 'kept' this knowledge from him, only for several people- including his wife- to point out that literally everyone else had seen it from the start, he was the only one who never bothered paying his son enough attention to realise it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">Series Continuity Error</a>: Quite a few;<ul><li> The year number got muddled when <em>The White Dragon</em> was published (15PP when it should really have been 13PP), and subsequent prequel books made this problem impossible to fix without messing up the chronology of the stories. The two main side-effects of this is that it means F'lessan somehow became a Candidate while two years underage, and Mirrim's Path took <em>four years</em> instead of two to become fully mature.</li><li> Character names - both major and minor - frequently end up changing between books. The worst example of this happening is probably that Lord Larad's wife's name strangely changes from Dulsay to Janissary in <em>All the Weyrs of Pern</em> and back to Dulsay again in <em>The Skies of Pern</em>.</li><li> In a few instances, a dead character has ended up appearing in a book that takes place after their death. Lord Oterel offers his support to young Readis in <em>The Dolphins of Pern</em>, despite a major part of the previous book dealing with people choosing his successor after his death.</li><li> In <em>Dragonquest</em>, Fandarel claims to have no sons. In <em>Renegades of Pern</em>, which takes place only a few years later, he apparently not only has four off-screen sons, but Piemur ends up in a relationship with his adult <em>granddaughter</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexByProxy">Sex by Proxy</a>: Thanks to the mental link between dragons and riders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderSizedDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderSizedDragon">Shoulder-Sized Dragon</a>: The fire-lizards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish">Space Amish</a>: The original colonists wanted to get away from a spacefaring society that had just been through an interstellar war, but they didn't plan on losing as much technology as they did.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster">The Spymaster</a>: MasterHarpers seem to be relatively benign examples. In addition to their teaching duties, almost all harpers sent abroad to teach also report on the general mood of the holds they're assigned to. In addition the Hall seems to produce one or two overly curious and quick-witted apprentices each generation. They eventually become one step below active spies, sent wherever their particular talents can be used and reporting directly to the MasterHarper. As of the Ninth Pass their chief agents seem to be Nip, Tuck<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/Traller, Sebell, and Piemur</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>: All time travel in the series either results in one of these, or is the result of one of these. There's even a case or two where someone travels in time because they see something that makes them realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">they already had</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">Starving Artist</a>: Iantine, in <em>Dragonseye</em>, is reduced to this on account of the bad weather and political corruption he encounters in Bitra.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>: A few of them:<ul><li> A minor one in <em>Dragonflight</em>, where Lessa, Fax and F'lar are all intriguing over who has the right to rule Ruatha Hold. Lessa is the (unknown) dispossessed rightful heir to Ruatha, Fax is the usurper, and F'lar unseats Fax, but in favor of Fax's son Jaxom rather than in Lessa's favor. In F'lar's defense, he didn't know at the time that Lessa was farther up the line of succession. No one except Lessa did.</li><li> In the Harper Hall trilogy, Meron deliberately avoids naming a successor as he's dying (he wants a bloody succession fight to spite everyone), until Robinton uses reverse psychology to get him to select the relative he <em>thinks</em> nobody wants.</li><li> In <em>All The Weyrs Of Pern</em>, Oterel's death requires the other lords to vote on his successor. Thanks to petty political bickering, they have a lot of trouble getting consensus on the one son who isn't blatantly an idiot or wastrel.</li><li> The manner of resolving these changes across the books. In <em>Dragonflight</em> F'lar resolves the matter of Fax's succession by himself. In <em>Dragondrums</em> the matter of the Nabol succession requires an explicitly named successor. <em>All the Weyrs</em> has a Council of the combined Lords and Craftmasters electing a new Lord when there is no named successor, with the chosen Lord being appointed after the meeting is over. <em>Skies</em> has another Council-appointed Lord Holder, only this one is appointed moments after being elected by the Council, and is invited to sit on the Council as a full participant for the remainder of the session.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">Synchronization</a>: Riders and their dragons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague">Synthetic Plague</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> How thread is ultimately made extinct, as a fail-safe in addition to altering the course of the Red Star. Using rediscovered technology, they learn that thread is just one part of a complex space-borne ecology in the Pernese Oort Cloud and that it has natural parasites. They then genetically engineer one of these parasites into a lethal and virulent form, and seed the parasites such that the oort cloud will be infected by it.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">Teacher/Student Romance</a>: Robinton and Menolly, but an unusual example. They know they're fond of each other, and after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his heart attack</span> they both admit that said feelings are not 100% platonic. However, she's involved with someone else, and he is very much in favor of that relationship. So other than that brief recognition and pang, his relationship to her remains teacher / surrogate family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer">Technician vs. Performer</a>: Petiron vs. Robinton/Menolly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">Tele-Frag</a>: One of the risks of going <em>between</em> with a poorly visualized destination.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">Teleportation</a>: Dragons and fire lizards are innate teleporters, and can bring passengers with them. This is accomplished by making use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a>, colloquially termed <em>between</em>, which lacks all sensation and is killingly cold. It is later discovered that they can teleport across interplanetary distances as well as through time, but the amount of time spent <em>between</em> increases with distance travelled (temporally and spacially). There's no oxygen <em>between,</em> which puts a very definite limit on hops through space and/or time (until the Pernese rediscover their ancestors' technology and gain access to space suits allowing them to carry an air supply <em>between</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportationMisfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportationMisfire">Teleportation Misfire</a>: One of the obvious risks of a poorly visualized trip <em>between</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>: An innate, if rarely used, ability of dragons and fire lizards. When travelling <em>between</em>, one must visualize one's destination accurately; apparently, this also includes time references. For example, if you visualize your destination in the morning, that's when you'll get there. It's even got a colloquial term in the story: "timing it".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a>: Most notably with T'ton/T'ron and Mardra between <em>Dragonflight</em> and <em>Dragonquest</em>. Toric arguably qualifies as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncoffee">Uncoffee</a>: <em>Klah</em>, which is made from tree bark, started out as the colonists' ersatz coffee, and ended up filling the same cultural niche. It's explicitly stated to contain stimulants and taste exactly like hazelnut coffee. <em>Dragonsdawn</em> explains that coffee can't flourish on Pernese soil, and the tea plants were lost in the first threadfall, so the colonists looked elsewhere for their caffeine needs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a>: "Shards", "Shells", "Scorch it", and various other oaths are employed by Weyrfolk, mostly relating to dragons or Thread. Makes sense, as there's no religion on Pern, but respect for the dragonriders as saviors from Thread kind of fills a similar cultural role. "Fardling" is their variant of the "F" word. There's an index specifically for these in the early novels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCouldHaveAvoidedAllThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCouldHaveAvoidedAllThis">We Could Have Avoided All This</a>: Silvina's reaction in <em>Dragonsong</em> when she finds out Menolly is Petiron's secret prodigy. She becomes rather angry at all the trouble they all could've avoided had Petiron trusted in Robinton not to dismiss such a talent simply because of her gender.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>: Robinton grew up as one; his father ignored him in favour of his work and never gave him any approval despite how accomplished he was even as a young child. Even when Robinton proved his abilities beyond what anyone expected of him, Petiron wouldn't praise him, he'd just act as though it was the bare minimum required and criticise his son for faults nobody else cared about.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> Mardra abruptly vanishes halfway through <em>The Renegades of Pern</em> and is never mentioned again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">What Measure Is a Non-Cute?</a>: Dragons? Gaze up in awe and go "whoa, cool!" Fire lizards? Gather round and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squee">Squee!</a> over the pretties. Watch-whers? Chained to a wall as barely tolerated "watchdogs". Although they are shown as capable of friendship and loyalty, and their distant kinship to dragons is mentioned from book one, it is not until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequels</a> that their origin is revealed &mdash; partially failed experiments in creating a second type of dragon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>: Toric of Southern, in particular, seems to go back and forth between grudging ally and scheming antagonist. For the most part he's an over-ambitious control freak who, for various reasons, dislikes most of the series' protagonists and enjoys inconveniencing them, but doesn't really cross the line into actual villainy; he can even be occasionally helpful. In the later books, however, he becomes more and more obsessive and secretive, and his agenda more overtly sinister.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>: Several of the Ninth Pass books are a bit inconsistent with their events and what year they took place in. For example, <em>The White Dragon</em> is repeatedly said to take place five years after <em>Dragonquest</em>, yet the date given - 15PP - is actually seven years afterwards. In one particularly jarring example, Readis is said to be seven at the beginning of <em>The Dolphins of Pern</em>, despite the fact that his parents only met each other five years prior.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">You Already Changed the Past</a>: There are no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradoxes</a> in this universe. If you use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> to go backwards, you had already been there and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble">had done what you did</a>. In fact, several characters use this type of foreknowledge specifically to plan their trips, setting up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.</li></ul><hr>
