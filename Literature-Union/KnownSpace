The fictional universe also includes things that are found outside of "Known Space" proper (that is, the space that is regularly travelled by humans and the aliens around them), such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a>, the Puppeteer Fleet of Worlds (by way of which the Pierson's Puppeteers are fleeing the Milky Way), and the homeworld of the Pak, found somewhere close to the galactic core. The stories span approximately one thousand years of future history, from the first human explorations and colonizations of the Solar System (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack">in the 1970s and 1980s</a>) to the year 3122 (the year the chronologically last Known Space story, <em>Safe At Any Speed</em>, takes place).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Originally, the stories set in Known Space were set in two separate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">universes</a>. The first, composed mainly of Niven's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidMiners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidMiners">Belter</a> stories, the Gil "The Arm" Hamilton mysteries, and the novels <em>World Of Ptavvs</em>, <em>A Gift From Earth</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Protector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Protector">Protector</a></em>, were about the initial colonization of the solar system, and the use of slower-than-light travel to colonize planets in other solar systems. The second universe was set much farther into the future and was composed of the Beowulf Shaeffer and Louis Wu stories, as well as a handful of other short stories. The two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">universes</a> were combined in Niven's short story <em>A Relic Of The Empire</em>, which featured elements of the Thrintun Empire (from the novel <em>World Of Ptavvs</em>, one of the Belter stories) being dealt with by people from his faster-than-light setting.</p><p>Roughly 300 years separates the timeline of the last stories of the Belter setting (which are set roughly between the years 2000 and 2350), from the earliest stories in the later Neutron Star/Ringworld setting (which are set in 2651 (Neutron Star) to 3100). In the late 1980s, Niven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding">opened up this gap in the known space timeline</a>, and the stories of the Man-Kzin Wars volumes fill in that history, joining the two settings.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhabitants of Known Space&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">Known Space features several well-realized alien species, many of whom are from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">planets of hats</a>.<ul><li> Kzinti: Agressive cat-like aliens who fight several brutal (and ultimately unsuccessful) interstellar wars with humanity.</li><li> Pierson's Puppeteers: A technologically advanced race of three-legged herbivores who consider courage a type of insanity. The name "Puppeteer" is derived from their twin heads, which a Puppeteer uses as both mouths and hands (their brain is located inside their "torso"), that greatly resemble sock puppets.</li><li> Kdatlyno: A reptilian species that "see" by way of sonar. A race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">warrior poets</a> who were enslaved by the Kzinti until humanity freed them.</li><li> Grogs: Sessile, eyeless telepaths who resemble fur-covered cones. Thought to be descendants of the Thrintun. Generally friendly, but a human ship in orbit around the Grog homeworld's star stands ready to trigger an immense solar flare if they try anything.</li><li> Bandersnatchi: Slug-like creatures the size of city busses, named for a line in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jabberwocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a>". They were originally genetically engineered by the Tnuctipun to be used as a food animal by the Thrintun. The Thrintun thought them to be unintelligent, but they are, in fact, just as intelligent as the average human being.</li><li> Trinocs: Trilaterally symmetrical aliens who breathe methane instead of oxygen. They are culturally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">paranoid</a> by human standards (in return, they find humans to be far too trusting and naive).</li><li> The Outsiders: Fragile aliens shaped like cats o' nine tails that don't need to breathe air and live on huge, slow-moving starships and trade information and technology with other species in return for refueling rights. The Outsiders are the most technologically advanced of all the species in Known Space (and considering the Puppeteers, that's saying something). It was the Outsiders that sold humans the secret to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> (and sold the technology necessary to turn an entire planet into a starship to the Puppeteers), although they do not appear to use it themselves. Consummate capitalists, any technology they have access to is available, for a price.</li><li> The Pak.

Breeder-stage Pak are also known as <em>Homo habilis</em>, and descendants of abandoned breeders are fairly common across Known Space and beyond, and will all transform into protectors when exposed to the virus.

They wanted a race of warriors to fight in case it was a threat to them, specifically.

The reason is due to the perfection of organ transplant technology. Once the government adopted "involuntary organ donation" as its official means of execution, all state executions are done in hospitals, and people started voting to make more and more crimes capital crimes to keep up with the demand for transplant material. This results in a massive, irreversible change in Earth's culture, as in Niven's universe, psychology is more nature than nurture; violence, deception and greed have a genetic basis that organ harvesting weeded out of the population, along with a great deal of humanity's self-preservation, self-motivation and self-interest. After a few generations of this, "flatlanders" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">pacifistic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">completely obedient to authority</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiIntellectualism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiIntellectualism">rather stupid</a>. This system collapses when artificial organs become cheap and effective, and by the year 3000, the organ-based death penalty laws have vanished, but the cultural impact was pretty much permanent.</li><li> In the novel <em>A Gift From Earth</em>, the government of the planet Plateau is propped up by the fact that the Crew (the "noble" class) control all the medical technology on the planet, including the organ banks (which are not only used to punish regular criminals, but also "punish" dissidents, "political" offenders, and the merely inconvenient as well), and thus have ultimate power over the Colonists (the "peasantry").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPlanetsAreEarthlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPlanetsAreEarthlike">All Planets Are Earthlike</a>: Way, way averted. With the exception of Home (which was so named <em>because</em> it was so Earthlike), all of the alien worlds in Known Space have at least one significant environmental difference (and in some cases, <em>several</em> significant environmental differences) from Earth.<ul><li> It's particularly significant with the pre-hyperdrive colony planets. While the colony probes did indeed follow their programming, humans hadn't gotten the programming <em>quite</em> right. Instead of finding Earth-like worlds, they had a tendency to find an Earthlike <em>point</em> on the worlds they were sent to, even if the rest of the planet was not at all Earthlike. Since the "slowboat" colony ships that followed the probes were one-way trips, there was nothing the colonists could do upon arrival except make the most of the situation.</li><li> Even after the hypderdrive became available, Earth's draconian government would make a North Korean leader blush and even marginally habitable worlds are fairly rare, meaning population pressure drives humans to take whatever they can get.<ul><li> Plateau, which has a crushing, corrosive atmosphere not unlike Venus, except for one 40-mile high mountain that rises above the majority of the hellish atmosphere, making the plateau at the top habitable. A planet 95% the size of Earth with habitable area roughly the size of Southern California. When the probe found the Plateau it sent a message back to Earth saying "Come on over!" The mountain itself is called Mt. Lookitthat, after what one of the slowboat crew said when they finally spotted it after cruising around for hours looking for somewhere to set down.</li><li> Jinx has a gravity 1.7x Earth and is shaped like an egg. The ends rise entirely out of the atmosphere and the equatorial zone's atmospheric pressure is unbearable except by Bandersnatch or specially-armored vehicles. The probe noticed that there is a band between the ends and the middle where humans can breathe.</li><li> We Made It (natives &mdash; called "Crashlanders" &mdash; are some of the best starship pilots in Known Space) has hyper-hurricane-like winds scouring the surface for most of the year due to the fact it orbits with its axis of rotation parallel to the plane of orbit. The probe landed during the calm season...</li><li> Home (the planet named so) is the exception that proves the rule. It was named "Home" because its size, gravity, atmospheric makeup, axial tilt, and ocean coverage are within a couple percentage points of Earth's. It's the same size as Earth to within a few dozen miles and thus has a gravity statistically the same as Earth's. An axial tilt only .3 degrees greater than Earth's and a division of the dry land into a half dozen continents produce basically the same weather effects as Earth. For the <em>disadvantage</em> of Home, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">Depopulation Bomb</a>.</li><li> A particularly notable one was once named "Warhead" &mdash; a Mars-like rock used by the Kzin as a military outpost during the Third Man-Kzin War. Humans used a not-quite-Death Star-level disintegrator beam to wipe out the bases &mdash; which were in a line on the equator &mdash; in the process digging a <em>twelve mile deep trench the length and breadth of the Baja peninsula</em>. The attack ended the Third Man-Kzin War, nicknaming the beam the "Wunderland Treatymaker". The planet was renamed "Canyon", as it turns out a Mars-like world's atmosphere is an Earth-like atmosphere if it all falls into a Baja-sized canyon. Oh, and there was enough water vapor in the atmosphere to create a fairly deep ocean at the bottom, so the cities had to be built into the cliff-faces.</li><li> Fafnir was similarly a planet taken from the Kzin and therefore can't be blamed on a stupid probe, but its surface is almost entirely covered by water except for one small continent and a bunch of islands. Most people do live on the single continent, but there are settlements on the islands and at least one domed underwater city.</li></ul></li><li> Could be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Zigzagged Trope</a> example, as planets which, judging by their hostile baseline environment, shouldn't have <strong>any</strong> locations that are Earth-like still manage to have isolated sub-regions or seasons that humans can handle just fine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: Details about several human colony planets, aliens and Ringworld species are found only in the <em>Ringworld</em> RPG rulebooks.

Millions of years of constant struggle between themselves has made them the perfect fighting machine. Problem is, humanity evolved from the Pak. When a Pak breeder (which starts out about as smart as a chimpanzee) makes the change to the protector stage, the ensuing being's intelligence is increased by a certain ratio; human breeders, on the other hand, are much smarter than chimpanzees, and when they make the change to protector, their intelligence increases proportionately. In short, its simply impossible for a Pak protector to out-think a human protector, which is why human protectors Brennan and Truesdale run roughshod over every protector they come up against.<ul><li> It also explains how a Protector-stage Louis Wu could think rings around Proserpina and Hanuman (both of whom were non-sentient before their change to protector-stage), but couldn't out-think Tunesmith, who was not only already sentient before his change, but was smarter than Luis was on an individual basis, and thus continued to be smarter after the change.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">Ambadassador</a>: Speaker-to-Animals was an embassy legate of the Kzinti ambassador to Earth before being recruited for the First Ringworld Expedition.

While he was not an ambassador as such, Puppeteers insane enough to travel by starship are so rare that any Puppeteer a human is likely to meet who is in good standing back home (unlike Hindmost during the Second Ringworld Expedition) will have plenary consular powers as well as negotiating authority with the General Products Corporation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding">Ambiguous Ending</a>: <em>Fate of Worlds</em> says right on the cover that it is "The explosive finale to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> <strong>and</strong> the Fleet of Worlds series.

(In <em>Ringworld</em>, Luis Wu mentions a creature called a Reacher tearing a strip of flesh off him and dying when it ate it.)

After the Slaver War destroyed all other sentients in the galaxy, they slouched around, eating food yeast &mdash; the only thing they <em>can</em> eat and practically the only thing they can <em>do</em> without hands &mdash; and waited for someone other than Bandersnatchi to show up. <em>For two billion years</em>.

Or anything more than a rapidly dispersing cloud of ionized gas, for that matter. But it's <em>not a weapon</em>, honest!<ul><li> Acknowleged and poked fun of in the same book: all these not-weapons and Nessus's insistance on their ship being unarmed inspires Louis Wu to name the ship <em>"Lying Bastard"</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift">Technology Uplift</a>: The Kzin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s universe were bootstrapped by another species to serve as mercenaries.

One reason for this seems to be to give kzinti a legal basis for hunting particular sentient beings as prey. No other author has tried using the term "LE" in their Known Space stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TidallyLockedPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TidallyLockedPlanet">Tidally Locked Planet</a>: Jinx. The colonists live along a narrow band encompassing the prime meridian and have completely black skin from the radiation. It also has very high gravity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: The Kzinti. Between their room temperature I.Q.s and their uncontrollable hair-trigger tempers they lose every single fight they get into with anyone. The Man-Kzin Wars books are especially full of this trope; by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> we get a main character kzin who is only somewhat stupid and inept.<ul><li> They get smarter as time goes on due to natural selection. The dumbest ones get killed by humans the quickest, so after several hundred years of wars...</li><li> The Kzinti aren't so much dumb as it took them three or four losses in the Man-Kzin wars to learn the "think" step before "scream and then leap"...<ul><li> Again, they didn't so much "learn not to do it" as "every Kzin with violent instincts strong enough to inhibit forethought died before they could breed". Natural selection in action!</li><li> In <em>Destiny's Forge</em>, the Patriarch makes the point that the expansion of the Patriarchy is an important safety valve to direct the aggression of the Prides outward, rather than focused on each other, and that he cannot dictate that the continued raids against humans stop without giving the Prides something of equivalent value that the humans are conceding.</li><li> It should be noted the Kzinti were enslaved in their early bronze age by another species who valued their martial abilities. The Kzin of course rebelled and used their former masters to uplift their species. They also tinkered with their genetic code. Essentially they wanted an army of Bronze Age heroes and their women to not be so Naggy. So the Real Men now rage and leap before they think, valuing bravery and strength over intelligence. The women were tinkered with enough to become near non-sentient over time. Although there appears to be a strong feedback, cultural bias at work, not simply the tinkered genetic one. Ringworld Kzin are noticeably less gender dimorphic (almost just as prone to going off pop, but also arguably more intelligent overall and with less of a bias against their tendency to produce lukewarm psychics). They've had longer to adapt to wider environments with more ape-like things willing to fight back. Also... getting the odd Protector maybe getting uppity in their general direction early on during relocation might've helped a bit.</li></ul></li><li> Literally so with the Thrintun. Once they developed their psychic mind-control powers they lost most of the selection pressure to evolve intelligence any further. Once other intelligent life discovered their world they lost the rest of that pressure, as they could get smarter slaves to think <em>for</em> them.</li><li> Humans from Earth, AKA "Flatlanders" have so little survival instinct the only reason they haven't gone extinct is because Earth itself is all but wrapped in rubber foam and its ecosystem has been scrubbed of every threat right down to the common cold. The richest flatlander alive goes on a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatlander_%28short_story%29">joyride<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to an unknown world simply because it's "distinctive", refuses to pay to learn exactly <em>why</em> it's "distinctive", and once in orbit, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">Made of Indestructium</a> General Products hull of his space yacht disintegrates. <em>He still wants to land and look around.</em> Rich boy's friend Beowulf Shaeffer puts his foot down, says, "We have no hull" and turns the boat around. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out the planet is made of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">antimatter</a></strong>.</span><ul><li> And at the end of the story, the guy is thinking of going back and throwing a <em>flag</em> at it.

It fires bowling-ball-sized pellets of pure neutronium.</li><li> In "Madness Has Its Place", the Terran solar system is defended from invaders by the Mercury Laser Array (a ring of solar-powered lasers all around the equator of Mercury), which was originally built as launching lasers for light-sail powered spacecraft. Of course, they are powerful enough to destroy ships as far out as the orbit of Neptune. There are also an array of magnetically powered mass-drivers that can fling metallic ore mined from asteroids across the solar system, spreading molten metal across the ships' paths. All of these tools were key in humanity's overwhelming victory over the Kzinti warfleet in the first Man-Kzin War, since Kzinti telepaths had reported that "humans have no weapons at all." "Madness Has Its Place" makes it clear that at least the paranoids of ARM have been fully aware of the dual-purpose nature of these devices for some time.</li><li> "The Warriors" brings us the <em>Angel's Pencil</em>, a human slower than light starship, with a main drive that doubles as an interstellar comunication laser. At maximum thrust, it pulls 1/6th of a g. It slices a Kzinti warship in two before the crew could react, and they'd figured out what was about to happen as it was being targeted.</li><li> The apex is the Ringworld Defense System. It functions via a superconducting mesh built into the Ringworld flooring material. After causing its sun to flare, it then magnetically excites the flare to lase in x-ray. It uses <em>a goddamn star</em> as an x-ray laser. Since Pak protectors built the Ringworld: a) it's supposed to be able to destroy rogue asteroids, planets or alien fleets that may threaten the Ringworld and b) protectors are not known for being subtle.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust">Weaponized Exhaust</a>: The warlike Kzinti stumble upon a completely demilitarised humanity.

It came as a great shock to the Kzinti, because their telepathic spies kept telling them that human spaceships were unarmed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">We Are as Mayflies</a>: The Pierson's Puppeteers have medical technology so advanced that they are functionally immortal as long as they can stay within easy access of an autodoc.
