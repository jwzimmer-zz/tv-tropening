<p>The novels <em>I, Claudius</em> and <em>Claudius the God</em> by Robert Graves, published in 1934 and 1935 follow the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">the Roman Empire</a>, from the latter reign of Emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a> (starting around 24/23 B.C.) to the death of the eponymous character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Claudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Claudius">Claudius</a>, through whose eyes all of the action is seen.</p><p>In 1976, the books were adapted into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> TV series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekJacobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekJacobi">Derek Jacobi</a> in the title role.</p><p></p><hr><h2>These books provide examples of:</h2><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes 0 to C&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>: Sejanus, Tiberius, and Caligula after he shows his true colors. Claudius himself, despite being a benign ruler, becomes unpopular during a food shortage in Rome.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating">100% Adoration Rating</a>: Germanicus is a very popular general and politician. Also Caligula during the first few months of his reign.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>:<ul><li> Claudius' mother Antonia was disgusted by him because of his disabilities, and always considered him to be an idiot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even when she decides to kill herself and says goodbye to Claudius, she still doesn't have a kind word for him.</span></li><li> Livia is very abusive towards her stepdaughter Julia.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyYouthfulMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyYouthfulMother">Absurdly Youthful Mother</a>: Livia, Julia, Agrippina and several other women from the imperial family. This is due to the fact that Roman noble women were married at a very young age.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Livia</span> acts like this towards Claudius when she invites him to have dinner. They have a polite and friendly conversation during which she confesses all of her crimes, knowing full well Claudius can't and won't seek vengeance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi">All Jews Are Ashkenazi</a>: Averted, since the story takes place some decades before the First Jewish&#150;Roman War and the Diaspora.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofLeaderAffableSubordinate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofLeaderAffableSubordinate">Aloof Leader, Affable Subordinate</a>: Tiberius is cold and bitter due to his mother's machinations to make him Emperor. When he does become Emperor, he spends much of his time at the pleasure island of Capri as opposed to ruling in Rome. His nephew and heir Germanicus is much more friendly and approachable. When some Roman legions start to mutiny, Germanicus takes care of the situation by talking to them and winning them over. He's so popular with the troops that Tiberius starts to worry he might pose a threat to his rule.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> in-universe by Claudius himself. As he states at the beginning of <em>Claudius the God</em>, he is worried that he might be "branded by posterity as a clever opportunist who pretended to be a fool, lying low and biding his time until he got wind of a Palace intrigue against his Emperor, and then came boldly forward as a candidate for the succession"; among other reasons, he wrote the history of his life to assure the readers that this was not the case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi">Ambiguously Bi</a>:<ul><li> Urgulanilla, Claudius' first wife, appears to have been infatuated with her sister-in-law Numantina, and is greatly upset when her brother divorces her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She takes as a lover a male slave named Boter, who is said to look very much like Numantina</span>.</li><li> Claudius suspects Caligula has a male lover, his cousin, known as Ganymede, but never confirms it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>: Many, many characters aim for the imperial throne, and end up getting killed. Unfortunately, many others who have no such ambitions also lose their lives in the endless struggle for power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicablyDivorced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicablyDivorced">Amicably Divorced</a>: Played with. Claudius' grandfather isn't angry when he finds out his wife Livia and his friend Augustus have fallen in love, and not only he divorces her, but also attends their wedding ceremony; and while their sons are raised in his house, he allows them to visit their mother every day. Livia, however, is still resentful of her ex-husband, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and when she finds out he's trying to give their sons a republican education, she poisons him</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a>: Several Roman lawyers are portrayed like this. Claudius greatly dislikes them, and when he becomes Emperor he tries to favor those few honest lawyers that work in the Forum.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">And There Was Much Rejoicing</a>: Tiberius' death is not mourned but celebrated in Rome, where he was very unpopular.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticOffspring">Antagonistic Offspring</a>: Tiberius comes to see his son Castor as this, due to Sejanus' manipulation and Castor's own rash behaviour. Because of that, Tiberius <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shows no grief when Castor dies</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApparentlyPowerlessPuppetmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApparentlyPowerlessPuppetmaster">Apparently Powerless Puppetmaster</a>: Claudius.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Aristocrats Are Evil</a>: Played with. Claudius himself and many other characters belong to the Roman nobility and are very decent people. On the other hand we have Macro, who is a man of very humble birth (the son of a slave) and is completely ruthless and amoral. Many other noble character play it straight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>:<ul><li> It's hard to feel sorry when characters like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Piso, Plancina, Sejanus, Livilla, Tiberius, Macro or Caligula</span> end up getting killed.</li><li> Most of the victims of Herod Agrippa's scams are described as this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">Awful Wedded Life</a>: All of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Claudius</span>' marriages end up like this, one way or another.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen">Bald Women</a>: Julia loses her hair when she's very young, and has to wear a wig for the rest of her life. However, the hair of the wig is prettier than her own natural hair, so it enhances her beauty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandOfBrothels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandOfBrothels">Band of Brothels</a>: The Roman prostitutes have their own union, and during Claudius' reign they sue one of their clients for mistreating some of the working girls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">Based on a True Story</a>: Yes and no. Most everything in the books, including the really outrageous stuff like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Livia poisoning half her family or Messalina having a sexathon</span>, comes from ancient sources. However, modern scholars consider much of that to be ancient rumormongering and/or propaganda. Graves also wasn't above using fiction as a platform for historical theories he thought were likely but was unable to prove.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathSuicide">Bath Suicide</a>: Several characters choose to die this way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a>: Claudius' daughter Antonia is implied to be this to her first husband, Pompey, who has male lovers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Claudius finds out of his son-in-law's sexual orientation, he has him killed and finds Antonia a new husband</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow">Beard of Sorrow</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Julia's exile</span>, Augustus refuses to shave for four days as a sign of grief.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a>: During Tiberius' reign, a rich man falls in love with a married woman who rejects his advances. Knowing she's a devoted worshiper of the goddess Isis, he manages to bed her by pretending to be the god Anubis. This scandal ends up leading to the banishment of the cult from Rome.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByInaction">Betrayal by Inaction</a>: Several people find out about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cassius Chaerea</span>'s plot to murder <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caligula</span>, but choose not to do anything about it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: Arguably, Livia is this during the first half of <em>I, Claudius</em>. Later it becomes clear that there are <strong>way</strong> worst people than her in power and that evil is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem">Inherent in the System</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship">Big Brother Worship</a>: Claudius adores his older brother Germanicus (as does almost everyone else).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBackfire">Bilingual Backfire</a>: The young Claudius overhears Augustus and Athenodorus talking about him in Greek. When Athenodorus jokingly asks his opinion, Claudius replies in Greek: "My mother Antonia does not pamper me, but she has let me learn Greek from someone who learned it directly from Apollo."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>:<ul><li> Livia pretends to be a traditional, virtuous Roman matron, who merely manages her household, takes care of her husband and stays out of politics.

Nevertheless, he is quite proud of his works. He also claims his official autobiography, written after he becomes emperor, is this.

While their union is clearly incestuous, the marriage is merely a political alliance and is never phisically consumated.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsOutShopping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsOutShopping">Villains Out Shopping</a>: <em>I, Claudius</em> has a scene where Tiberius takes a break from depravities and ordering executions to compose a verse-dialogue between the hare and the pheasant, in which they argue which one of them makes for a better meal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, he is then surprised by a fisherman who decided to visit him on Capri and present him a large barbel he had caught; Tiberius has the poor man brutally maimed and then killed, due to a misunderstanding. Livia had given him a false warning to beware of barbel, knowing that it was a favorite dish of his, in order to both feed his paranoia and torment him with the idea that his favorite foods might be tainted. When the hapless fisherman appeared, fish in hand, to offer it to Tiberius, the emperor thought it was an assassination attempt and ordered his guards to protect him from an assailant.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>: Livia manages to have a relatively good public image during Augustus' reign, although she's correctly blamed for many of her evil deeds. Later Caligula becomes this, during the first months of his reign.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>: The historians Livy and Pollio. For example, when they first meet the young Claudius in a library, Livy asks what is he reading. Pollio comments that it's probably some romantic rubbish, since today's youth reads nothing but trash. Livy makes a bet with him that it isn't. When Claudius reveals that he's reading a historical work by Pollio, Livy insists that Pollio won the bet: today's youth reads nothing but trash.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">Warrior Prince</a>: Augustus and, especially, Tiberius had distinguished military careers before becoming emperors. Caligula tries to become this, but fails both due to his madness and cowardice. Claudius manages to do it successfully in his conquest of Britain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: Livia. She acts as she does to prevent the restoration of the Republic, which in her view will lead to a return to civil war and instability. Even Claudius is forced to admit that she is a very capable administrator who genuinely cares about running the empire well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">Wicked Cultured</a>: Tiberius is well versed in astrology, poetry and mythology. Livia knows enough history to point out an erroneous reference during a conversation with Claudius (who's a professional historian).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a>: Livia is a textbook example of this in her treatment of Julia (Augustus' daughter from a previous marriage). Tiberius, who marries Julia, is very antagonistic towards her children from a previous marriage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding">Widowed at the Wedding</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Camilla</span>'s death counts as this, although she dies just before her bethrotal ceremony, instead of the wedding itself.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Silius and Messalina</span> are both killed (separately) on their wedding day.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Livia orders the death of her teenage great-grandson to prevent him from marrying the daughter of a political rival. Macro has Sejanus' underaged son and daughter executed (and the girl is raped before her death because it's bad luck to kill a virgin). Caligula orders the death of his young cousin Gemellus. In turn, Caligula's infant daughter is murdered by the same conspirators who killed the Emperor. Messalina tries to murder Nero when he is a child, but the attempt is thwarted.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>: During the reigns of Tiberius and Caligula, <strong>everyone</strong> in Rome has to become this in order to survive being near the Emperor. By the time Claudius takes the throne, people are treating him this way in spite of him not being a tyrant and encouraging them to disagree with his ideas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Livia poisons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Agrippa</span> when he is no longer needed to ensure the stability of Augustus' rule.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">Your Days Are Numbered</a>: Claudius is told by Thrasyllus exactly how long his life will be, down to the months and days he has left.</li></ul></div><p></p><hr>
