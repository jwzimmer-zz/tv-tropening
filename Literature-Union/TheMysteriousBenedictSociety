Mr. Benedict doesn't like risking the lives of a bunch of children but realizes that his tasks can only be done by kids. The main characters are constantly in danger. A day after deciding to join Mr. Benedict and his friends they nearly get violently kidnapped in their own home. Constance, who is an incredibly precocious <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>two</em>-year-old</span>, gets electrocuted and stuffed in a bag. As if that wasn't enough, there's a man out there who is kidnapping children and taking away people's memories, while broadcasting secret messages designed to prevent anyone from searching from them.

A secondary one seems to be that while one can sometimes take comfort in a lie, one would do better to seek out the truth, as it is better to know it in the long-run, even if it may cause pain in the short-term. Another ongoing theme is that it's okay for friendships to change.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">Agony of the Feet</a>:<ul><li> This happens to S.Q. Pedalian in <em>Perilous Journey</em> when he drops a metal box on his foot after being insulted by McCracken, leader of the Ten Men. Poor guy also closes his huge feet in doors a lot.</li><li> It also happens to Sticky in the first book, after he kicks a door. This isn't his fault, though&mdash; most of the secret doors in the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened are designed to be opened this way, as Mr. Curtain is fond of slamming through doors with his wheelchair. It's just that this particular door led to a very secret office of Mr. Curtain's and was protected by a numeric keypad.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a>: Strongly averted in <em>The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict</em>, in which the first adult that is truly helpful and kind to Nicholas Benedict is a prosecuting attorney.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusinglyShortList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusinglyShortList">Amusingly Short List</a>: Number Two reads off the list of children who passed the test in the session taken by Reynie.<div class="indent"><em>"Very well, if there are no other questions, I shall read the list." The room became very quiet. "Reynard Muldoon!" the woman called. Reynie's heart leaped. There was a grumble of discontent from the seat behind him, but as soon as it passed, the room again grew quiet, and the children waited with bated breath for the other names to be called. The woman glanced up from the sheet. "That is all," she said matter-of-factly, folding the paper and tucking it away. "The rest of you are dismissed."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo">And Your Little Dog, Too!</a>: In the first book, Reynie has a nightmare in which he is caught writing letters to his tutor Miss Perumal and Mr. Curtain tells him "Don't worry, you won't be punished! It's the Waiting Room for you &mdash; what <em>fun</em> you'll have there. And when you've disappeared beneath the stinking mud for good, we'll get your beloved Miss Perumal too!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnxietyDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnxietyDreams">Anxiety Dreams</a>: Reynie is sometimes prone to these in response to his worries about the Society's missions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgumentumAdNauseam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgumentumAdNauseam">Argumentum Ad Nauseam</a><ul><li> This is a favorite of Constance's; if she can't get what she want, then, if possible, she'll just argue and argue until she wears the other side down. It's actually instrumental in the first book in her part in defeating Mr. Curtain's Whisperer. As she starts to grow up, however, she begins to realize the problems with it, such as when she uses her powerful mental abilities to "convince" Sticky to give her his ice cream, but suffers intense flu-like symptoms as a result.</li><li> Similarly, Mr. Curtain's messages broadcasts from the Whisperer are this on a subconscious level. He broadcasts the same set of messages over and over, repeated in children's voices in a subconscious part of the mind, until people are brainwashed into believing that things are out of control, but that they must obey the Institute and that Mr. Curtain will protect them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepInClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepInClass">Asleep in Class</a>: The plot of the first book of the series revolves around the members of the titular society acting as spies for Mr. Benedict at the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened. The pressures of this take their toll until one day Sticky, who has been doing very well otherwise, ends up falling asleep in class. For this, he gets teased by the Messenger student Martina Crowe, causing the entire class to laugh at him. In retaliation, Kate uses her feet to tie Martina's shoelaces to her desk, causing her to fall when she tries to get up. Constance also regularly falls asleep in class, though nobody teases her about it because she's not a good student. Also, though nobody knows it at the time, the only reason she does it is because she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">two years old</a> and therefore of course takes regular naps.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad">Bad is Good and Good is Bad</a>: In <em>Extraordinary Education</em>, the Spiders have grown so desperate to get at Nicholas Benedict that they decide that if push comes to shove, they'll humiliate him out in the open, even if it means getting punished for it. One of them comments that if they're going to get punished, then they had better make it good, and another says "By good you mean bad, right?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>: The main plot of <em>The Riddle of Ages</em> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">basically one massive Batman gambit. The Ten Men are lured to the KEEP (Key Enclosure for Enemies of the Public) on the premise that they can break out their boss, Mr. Curtain, and possibly capture Constance in the process. They are also led to believe that both Mr. Benedict and Mr. Curtain have been poisoned by a serum of Mr. Curtain's invention and that the members of the Mysterious Benedict Society are there to deliver the antidote. In fact, the KEEP is secretly a trap to imprison them and neither Mr. Benedict nor Mr. Curtain has been poisoned, instead working together to trap the Ten Men after Curtain felt sure they would try to betray him. Complicating things are the Ten Men's use of a telepath known as the Listener, and a telepath child tagging along with the Society after Constance intercepted him, requiring the older members of the Society to guard their thoughts from all three telepaths and keep them from knowing what's really going on.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill">Bavarian Fire Drill</a>: In <em>Perilous Journey</em>, Reynie tricks an unpleasant guard into letting him and the other members of the Society exit the house by stating that they were ordered to get some packages from the car, and then asking in a worried tone if he'll let them back in once they've got the packages. "After all, we do have permission."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseISaidSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseISaidSo">Because I Said So</a>: In <em>Perilous Journey</em>, when one of the Ten Men asks Martina Crowe why they shouldn't take Reynie and the others to Mr. Curtain in the cave, she snaps "Because I said so!", though Reynie suspects her unstated reason is because this would mean that they were no longer under her direct control.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>:<ul><li> Each of the members of the Mysterious Benedict Society are chosen for their own particular talents and though they may at times wish to be more like each other or doubt themselves, ultimately they can only succeed by being themselves. Used humorously when Constance is lamenting a hastily devised plan that even narration describes as being "bold, ill-formed and likely to fail."</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"How are we supposed to do that?" Constance asked, launching into a tirade about how ill-prepared they were, how little time they had, and how this plan was giving her a worse headache than the hidden message broadcasts did. "So I ask you again," she concluded, "exactly how are we supposed to distract the Helpers?" "Just be yourself," Kate said with a sigh.</em></div><ul><li> Later in the first book, the Society are given a clue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">advising the opposite</a>, telling them that success requires them to become something they are not to keep on top of things. The group eventually realizes that the answer is "cheaters", and they devise ways to cheat in their exams so that they can be promoted and learn more about what Mr. Curtain is doing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout">Big Blackout</a>: In <em>The Prisoner's Dilemma</em>, one of these hits the city of Stonetown, along with a complete radio communications breakdown. It's all thanks to Mr. Curtain, who took back control of his tidal turbines and used his specially developed signal disruption technology to kill the radios. All of this was used as cover to seize the Whisperer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm">Book Worm</a>: Reynie, Sticky and Mr. Benedict. Reynie is just as much a voracious reader as the other two, but doesn't possess their eidetic memory, and thus, while being a reasonably fast and studious reader, can't process books nearly as fast as the other two, much to his disappointment. As a child, Mr. Benedict loved reading, but had access to few books, and was mostly left to scrounging for newspapers. Simply reading a dictionary was for him a real treat. When he moved to a new orphanage, his delight at discovering it had a massive library was matched only by his bitterness and disappointment that only a very limited amount of free time was allowed each day for reading and that he couldn't get permission to borrow books to take up to his room. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He eventually discovered that the library was the treasure of the wife of the former owner of the manor that became the orphanage, and managed to negotiate a deal to be allowed to read as much as he wanted.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Brainwashed</a>: The Whisperer "brainsweeps" people by burying their memories and identities, and can broadcast thoughts to influence the public.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingParentsByTheirName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingParentsByTheirName">Calling Parents by Their Name</a>: Even after Kate learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Milligan</span> is her father, she still refers to him as "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Milligan</span>."

In <em>The Perilous Journey</em>, it's revealed that his spells of sleeping caused by his narcolepsy are also often accompanied by frightening hallucinations, such as the Old Hag, a terrifying woman who appears before him. Unfortunately, <em>this</em> particular hallucination is also often accompanied by cataplexy, a form of paralysis.

In the original <em>The Mysterious Benedict Society</em> book, he discovers the traps on Nomansan Island thanks to them being hidden by drapeweed, a rare shade loving type of ivy. Later, it's Sticky's having spotted a patch of "wild chuck-root" (Euphorbia upchucuanhae) that helps the group in their plans, when they use it to give a bellyache to pretty much everyone in the Institute so that Reynie and Sticky can get their turns in the Whisperer sooner. The second book is itself focused largely around Mr. Benedict and his evil twin's attempts to acquire another rare plant, duskwort, which has the potential to cure their narcolepsy when mixed when other substances. In its normal form, however, it's an extremely potent plant that, when burned, releases smoke that can put entire villages to sleep, but it only thrives under very specific conditions.

Sticky's horror that even something so dear as one's children could be buried foreshadows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the enigmatic Milligan is under the same circumstances- having forgotten his daughter, Kate after being briefly captured by Curtain's men years ago.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTickleTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTickleTorture">Friendly Tickle Torture</a>: Reynie and Miss Perumal sometimes use this to wake up Miss Perumal's mother.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>: In the first book, the Society muse on this idea upon realizing the Executives were likely brainswept "special recruits".

Additionally, he made up pamphlets describing a supposed "Sudden Amnesia Disease," with sufferers known as "S.A.D. cases."

He arranges a secret password - the answer to a question that the man previously failed on a test. Constance uses her telepathic powers to steal the question from his mind, and Sticky provides the answer, which Constance then uses to transmit to Mr. Benedict, who is the one actually at the gate. When Mr. Benedict answers the question correctly, Mr. Curtain begins jerking his wheelchair, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability">he doesn't actually need to get around</a>, side-to-side.<div class="indent"><em>Then, half-closing his eyes, he began snapping his fingers and jerking his wheelchair side to side as if dancing.

At the beginning they're told to read every question before answering. Reynie takes the instructions literally and reads the whole test before answering any questions, and discovers that the answer to each question is hidden in another question in the same exam. Sticky passes by shocking the examiner by answering almost all of the questions correctly without figuring out the trick, missing the last few only because he ran out of time and got nervous. Kate neither figures out the trick nor is able to answer the questions, but is passed because she sticks around to assist the examiner out of a tight spot. Constance enters the exams never even trying to answer correctly, writing snide responses and poems instead, but is given a pass through by sheer virtue of the fact of <em>making it there</em> despite being only 2 years old.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>: In the original <em>The Mysterious Benedict Society</em> book, Mr. Curtain's Whisperer invention actually provides Reynie with the encouragement he needs to resist it. The Whisperer is designed to soothe fears by simply telling those in it soothing messages. Reynie's fear, however, is of being alone, and of being so because he's betrayed his friends. It tells him that he would never betray his friends, that he's strong enough, which is exactly what Reynie needs to hear to <em>not</em> betray them by holding out against the Whisperer until help can come.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatYouFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatYouFear">I Know What You Fear</a>: The Whisperer is able to detect an individual's worst fear when they're seated in it.

In actuality, she does sleep, but only a very small amount, like maybe two-three hours a night. She has to compensate for this by eating a lot of snacks, which sometimes leaves her irritable if her blood sugar gets low. In the second book, it becomes a key plot point. When she and Mr. Benedict are captured and handcuffed in place in a cave on an island, her near-constant wakefulness allows her to work away at the fastening pin on her handcuffs and free herself. Unfortunately, in order to do this, she has to keep hidden the fact that she requires extra food in order to properly maintain her mental state.

At one point, during a heated discussion, Constance refers to him as "George," it being an old habit of hers to try to needle him using his real name. Far from being insulted, he instead thanks her for remembering to use his real name, despite her obvious irritation with him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillPunishYourFriendForYourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillPunishYourFriendForYourFailure">I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure</a>: In <em>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma</em>, Reynie, Sticky, Kate and Constance are trapped by Mr. Curtain in a prison cell. Kate escapes through a window because she's the only one of them who can, but she gets caught. When she is brought back, Mr. Curtain brings out the shiny silver gloves that he uses to inflict pain by delivering a powerful electric shock and uses them on Reynie. When Kate complains that this isn't fair because Reynie wasn't the one who escaped, Mr. Curtain responds that he decides what is fair and warns that if anyone acts up again, the punishment will be extended to <em>all four of them</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop">Jaw Drop</a>:<ul><li> <em>The Mysterious Benedict Society</em>:<ul><li> The jaws of many of the students of the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened drop when Reynie approaches Mr. Curtain from the front while he's sitting in his favorite spot, something no student has ever done before.</li><li> Martina's jaw drops with disbelief after S.Q. asks Mr. Curtain if they should be asking permission to put things in people's minds.</li><li> Sticky's jaw drops when Reynie tells him that he should try to resist the Whisperer and stretch out the session to buy him time to signal Kate and Constance.</li><li> Mr. Curtain's jaw drops after, when having failed to open his secret door with the code-word "control," Reynie (correctly) suggests trying it in Dutch instead (you just add an "e" at the end.)</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Perilous Journey</em>:<ul><li> Risker nearly drowns after trying to retrieve what he thought was a diamond, but turns out to obviously be a fake because it's floating on the water.

He tells him that he doesn't understand her and therefore he doesn't trust her. Reynie replies that this is perfectly understandable, "but you know what they say about those you don't trust." Mr. Curtain replies that no, he <em>doesn't</em> know what it is that they say and Reynie says "If you don't trust them, keep them close." This amuses Mr. Curtain, but also makes sense to him, and it throws suspicion off Reynie, while also serving Reynie's purpose of allowing Constance to stay at the Institute.

The Society has adopted the gesture by the fourth book.<div class="indent"><em>"Do you think that's what happens to him, (Mr. Curtain) too?

Of course, it's technically true since the test was only about a minute away from beginning, though the real truth was that her very presence there was part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> and Reynie would have been automatically disqualified had he agreed to cheat by making use of her test answers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a>: Milligan was pretty introverted and reserved until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he remembered that Kate was his daughter.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability">Obfuscating Disability</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mr. Curtain uses a wheelchair and reflective sunglasses to cover up his narcolepsy.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>: Early on in the first book, Reynie decides when he gets to the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened to give the impression of knowing as little as possible because the less you know, the less people suspect you, and perhaps the more they tell you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Only Known by Their Nickname</a>:<ul><li> Sticky and Number Two.

More interesting is the case of the Executives Jackson and Jillson. As described in <em>The Perilous Journey</em>, "The children had never determined if the two Executives were brother and sister, boyfriend and girlfriend, or simply partners in crime. They didn't even know them by any names other than Jackson and Jillson &mdash; which could have been first names, last names, or nicknames." There's also Milligan, who is only ever known in the series as Milligan due to it being a codename he picked up from the last fragment of his pre-amnesia memory.

While the doorways leading to some of the secret, but not super-secret areas in the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened are <em>not</em> locked, they're actually designed in such a way that they're opened only by ramming or kicking, as Reynie discovers when he grows so frustrated in trying to open one of them that he kicks it. The reason for this is that Mr. Curtain enjoys ramming through doors in his souped-up wheelchair. The super-secret areas, however, are protected by numeric keypads, and no amount of kicking will get you through them. This is something that Sticky discovers to his chagrin before the keypad is spotted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a>: In <em>The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict</em>, the new orphanage that the titular protagonist is sent to isn't exactly awful in that nobody is starved, nor really abused, but it's certainly not a nice place to be either. Children that wake up screaming from a nightmare are forced to wear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DunceCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DunceCap">Dunce Cap</a> and most of the kids spend their days in fear of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gang of Bullies</a> called "The Spiders" whom the adults are too oblivious too do anything about.

This is the final straw that causes him to truly run away. At the end of the first book, he learns that in fact what his parents had said was that perhaps <em>he</em> was better off without them because of how badly they had messed things up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a>: In <em>The Perilous Journey</em>, Kate manages a spur-of-the-moment one by removing her hair from its ponytail, wearing Sticky's spectacles, <em>not</em> wearing her usual red bucket and moving in a shuffling gait that is completely at odds with her normal swiftness. While it ultimately doesn't fool Jillson, it does buy the Mysterious Benedict Society time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish">The Password Is Always "Swordfish"</a>: Early on in the first book, Mr. Curtain tells Reynie to "remember, control is always the key." Later, the group has to figure out the password for the keypad on Mr. Curtain's wheelchair and Mr. Curtain's maniacal ravings prompt Reynie to believe that it might be "control." As it turns out, it isn't, but Mr. Curtain's love of his home country of Holland leads him to believe that the password might be in Dutch. Since Sticky knows most languages, he asks him, and it turns out you just have to add an "e" to the end of "control." They do so, and it's correct.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">Phony Psychic</a>: In <em>The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict</em>, Nicholas Benedict uses his prodigious memory and talent for observing human behavior patterns to pass himself off as psychic at the orphanage at Rothschild's End. His tricks include quickly memorizing the names of everyone there, memorizing the entire layout of the building and seeming predict future events based on his observations of past behavior.

Mr. Benedict is only shown demonstrating it in the prequel book <em>The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict</em>, but it does bring to mind a scene from the original book. Reynie is in Mr. Benedict's study, admiring all the books there, and asks Mr. Benedict if he's read all the books. Mr. Benedict replies "My dear boy, what do you think?"</li><li> Rhonda also has this, though perhaps not as strong, as she directly quotes a message from Curtain in the second book to let the Society see if there is a clue in the wording of it.</li><li> Seeing as he's Mr. Benedict's identical twin, it's very likely that Mr. Curtain has one as well, though it's never stated.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitifulWorms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitifulWorms">Pitiful Worms</a>: In the first book, after realizing that the members of The Mysterious Benedict Society are spies, Mr. Curtain refers to them and children in general as gnats that are easy to crush.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionNotPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionNotPunishment">Promotion, Not Punishment</a>: Martina Crowe becomes an Executive after Reynie voices concerns about her to Mr. Curtain.

He tells them he'll be waiting for them at the bathroom the next day, with cookies. Of course, he makes enemies of them, since he most certainly does <em>not</em> arrive with cookies the next day, but as he explains to John, he felt it was worth it because he'd already been the butt of bullying at several past orphanages and wanted to take a stand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Kid</a>: Tai Li in the fourth book is a five-year-old boy who joins the group after Constance guides him to the Society, recognizing him as a fellow telepath, and one in danger from the Ten Men.

He just wants to control everyone so that they can be happy, at least he believes this to be so.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">Trilogy Creep</a>: The main series featuring Reynie, Sticky, Kate and Constance could be considered a trilogy, as the other two books were a prequel set well before their adventures and a supplementary book of puzzles and games and such. However, on September 24, 2019, a new title was released featuring more of the adventures of the Mysterious Benedict Society as well as a new member, <em>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Riddle of Ages</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">Unresolved Sexual Tension</a>: An unusual case in the fourth book. It's made explicit that part of the reason the older children are so stressed-out and awkward around each other is that they're experiencing some budding romantic feelings for each other now that they're older, as Constance has the burden of knowing through her telepathy that all three have harbored crushes on another member. However, it's never specified who has been attracted to whom, and so the tension exists but without a defined pairing in any direction.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing">Vagueness Is Coming</a>: This appears in the first book as "the thing to come." Mr. Benedict and his crew are already aware that "the Sender" is the cause of the phenomenon known as the Emergency and due to a number of factors have good reason to believe that something much worse is coming. Due to their limited ability to gather information up until the arrival of the main characters (the titular society), they don't know what this "thing to come" is, only that for them and those like them whose minds have a powerful love of truth, it is likely to be very bad indeed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater">Walk on Water</a>: Referenced in <em>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey</em>. When the kids follow Milligan despite his warning, Reynie uses the excuse that they figured the stairs were sound because they held his weight. Milligan replies that he walks lightly, so they should never let that be their guide. It is stated that Reynie isn't sure whether or not Milligan is teasing - "He wouldn't be entirely surprised to learn that Milligan could walk on water."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope">Well, This Is Not That Trope</a>: In <em>The Riddle of Ages</em>, Tai Li asks Crawlings if he's really going to drink the serum, knowing that Mr. Benedict needs a dose of it to cure himself. Crawlings gazes at him, seeing his eyes wide with innocent disbelief.<div class="indent"><em>There are times when even the worst of men&mdash;the most selfish, the most vindictive, the cruelest of men&mdash;need only to be confronted with the wisdom of small children to be reminded of the children they once were themselves; to be reminded, in short, of what is to imagine a world of magic and kindness rather than a world of wickedness and violence. This was not one of those times. Crawlings winked at Tai and drank the beaker down.</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: Mr. Curtain has one towards the end of the first book, revealing the extent of the improvements to his Whisperer machine: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it has recently been made capable of brainsweeping people even if they aren't seated in it.</span><div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Curtain</strong>:<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Obviously, Reynard, you were unaware of the extent of my improvements. You needn't be <em>seated</em> in my lovely Whisperer to experience its most powerful effect. In this room you are all quite within range.</span></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: Stonetown is apparently somewhere on the east coast of the United States, given that it borders the Atlantic Ocean. (It's definitely the United States, as Sticky's real name is said to be George Washington, the "same as the father of our country.") It also apparently it is at least somewhat to the north, given that it gets cold enough for snow not be unexpected in winter. Other than that, though, the details of the exact location are left a bit vague.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt">Worth It</a>: In <em>The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict</em>, this is Nicholas Benedict's reason for humiliating the orphanage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gang of Bullies</a> who try to subject him to an "initiation" likely involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Swirlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Swirlie">Swirlie</a> at the beginning of the book. He knows it's likely just going to make him their enemy for however long they all might remain at the orphanage, but after being the butt of bullies for so long his past orphanages, he decides that this one victory is worth it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Mr. Curtain, though he prefers to let his Executives and Recruiters / Ten Men do the dirty work.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetMeCoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetMeCoffee">You, Get Me Coffee</a>:<ul><li> When not having them do actual work, Mr. Curtain likes to have his various minions, including his Messengers, Executives, Recruiters and Ten Men do this sort of thing.<div class="indent"><em>Then S.Q. was removing their blindfolds and pressing the intercom button. "Reynard Muldoon and Stic . . . er, George Washington here for their sessions, Mr. Curtain!" Mr. Curtain&#146;s voice came through a speaker: "They must wait. Meanwhile, bring me more juice."</em></div></li><li> Reynie himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">exploits</a> this trope by bringing Mr. Curtain ribbons to use as bookmarks for his journal. Mr. Curtain is flattered, considering it to be "a proper attention that had been lacking."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">Wise Beyond Their Years</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Constance</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRemindMeOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRemindMeOfX">You Remind Me of X</a>: In the first book, Mr. Curtain tells Reynie that he reminds him of himself as a child, which can hardly be pleasing for Reynie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWontFeelAThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWontFeelAThing">You Won't Feel a Thing</a>: One of the Recruiters tells the children "If you children stay nice and still, I promise this won't hurt a bit." The other Recruiter that is with him suggests "Oh, come on, let's tell the truth for once. Just for kicks." The first Recruiter then admits "All right, the truth is that this will hurt. A <em>lot</em>. But if you hold still, I promise it won't hurt for <em>long</em>."</li></ul>
