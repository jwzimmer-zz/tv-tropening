Grace and Ghost Bird leave the tunnel and go past the remains of the Southern Reach. It's unknown whether there is a doorway out of Area X anymore and if the terraforming has extended to the rest of the Earth or if Control's death has made the Crawler realize that its mission was pointless.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Authority</em>, Control's point of view, while linear in general, tends to jump around the way his thoughts do. One scene would happen, followed by another, only for the narration to skip back and retell elements from the previous scene that had not been told yet, again and again, revealing new layers and information each time.</li><li> In <em>Acceptance</em>, several points in time are used to tell what is happening and what has happened in the past by way of the time and point of view changing each chapter. The lighthouse keeper serves as the point of view of pre-Area X times, the director's chapters reveal how the twelfth expedition came to be, and Ghost Bird and Control relate what is currently happening.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>:<ul><li> Both the biologist and the lighthouse keeper are heavily associated with birds. The biologist is nicknamed Ghost Bird by her late husband and the lighthouse keeper is an avid bird watcher, writing down what kind of birds he's seen on any given day.</li><li> There's also a lot of imagery relating to rabbits, as the Southern Reach's first attempts to breach the border involved sending hundreds of rabbits in, all of whom disappeared as soon as they touched the border. After Control sees the footage of this, he is haunted by images of rabbits turning into stars and vice versa, an image that comes up later with other characters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: The biologist is a thoroughly insular and withdrawn character who doesn't seem to care about other humans at all, and may be a sociopath. However, she's the closest thing the series has to a central protagonist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Log</a>:<ul><li> The lighthouse in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Area X</a> contains whole piles of apocalyptic logs: all expedition members keep a notebook of their experiences, and the notebooks of expeditions which never return always find their way to the lighthouse. By the time the biologist finds it, the pile has become alarmingly large.</li><li> In <em>Acceptance</em>, the lighthouse keeper's journal details odd jobs and animal sightings around the lighthouse but gradually degenerates into apocalyptic babbling and unintelligible scribbles.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol">Arc Symbol</a>: A spiral of light, first seen with the door to Area X and later revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> its original source</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>: While the series as a whole doesn't have an actively malicious antagonist &mdash; it's not entirely clear if Area X has some sort of will and even if it does its actual purpose remains unclear &mdash; other characters do fill a role in which they oppose or endanger the main characters for stretches of the story:<ul><li> The middle portion of <em>Annihilation</em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the psychologist</span> going rogue, and the potential threat she represents is the main issue at hand.</li><li> <em>Authority</em> has both Grace, an incredibly dense and tough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> who tramples on every attempt Control does at renovating the facilities or research as well as the Voice, Control's contact in Central. The latter ends up putting extreme pressure and stress on Control and also meddles with Grace, causing more more trouble. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's later revealed that the Voice is none other than Lowry, who had been hypnotizing Control all along</span>. Both Grace and the Voice are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeated by Control at the beginning of the third and last part of the book. The Voice is bested when Control figures out its hypnosis and breaks any hold it had on him, shattering Central's grasp on him. Grace in turn is placated when she and Control have a heart-to-heart in which both come to terms with each other and agree to cooperate peacefully.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>:<ul><li> The Crawler's writing, which reads like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays">warped, vaguely sinister version of a Bible passage</a> and is repeated throughout the trilogy.</li><li> "Terroir" is a word that comes up a lot in connection to the mystery of Area X, but ends up being used for any given environmental conditions that exist in a given area, with Control thinking how the Southern Reach and Central are terroirs in their own right. Since there's obviously something off with the environment in Area X, the word takes on a sinister connotation, and Control even mishears it as "terror" when Whitby first uses it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays">As the Good Book Says...</a>: The text lining the walls of the tower reads almost like a warped, vaguely sinister version of a Bible passage: <em>Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead...</em> It can be traced back to the lighthouse keeper due to semantic similarities, as he used to be a preacher.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a>: In the first book, the biologist rarely alludes to it in her point of view but she notices that she's significantly stronger than the surveyor, who is the team soldier. Later on, she reminisces about how the entire expedition was given extensive physical conditioning and weapons training before they went in. In the second book, where the physical descriptions of many of the characters are given, Control notes that the biologist is almost the same height as him and judging by the muscles between her neck and shoulders, looks very strong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Finally, the biologist survives 30 years in Area X before succumbing to it and turning into a monster that's alien even by Area X standards.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen">Bald Women</a>: The returning expedition members have the hair shaved as part of the decontamination procedure. As a result, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">the biologist</a> is bald at the beginning of the second novel, <em>Authority</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastWithAHumanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastWithAHumanFace">Beast with a Human Face</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The moaning creature</span> still has a recognizably human head. Disturbingly, its face seems to be in a permanent expression of agony.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">Big Bad Wannabe</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lowry views himself as Area X's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> and is obsessed with finding a way to "defeat" it, but he proves just as impotent in the face of the unknowable as everyone else, and may even be the unwitting catalyst for Area X's expansion over the whole planet</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: The biologist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is transformed into an enormous, near-immortal alien with a thousand eyes who can live on land or sea and travel between worlds. Grace and Control are horrified, but for an extreme loner and detail-oriented observer fascinated by new places and transitional ecosystems &mdash; is this such a terrible fate?</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>: Near the end of the first book the biologist muses that her unusual attitude towards society and humanity in general makes her react, both emotionally and practically, very differently than most people would to her findings in Area X.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>: Expedition members are warned to avoid contamination by Area X as it's not know what happened to those who did not return. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though most became part of Area X by turning into animals, some turned into grotesque monsters that are neither animal nor human. The psychologist of the last 11th expedition became the moaning creature, a monster with patchy white skin, too many extremities, a human face and a bone-slicing moan it cannot contain come evening.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">Break Out the Museum Piece</a>: Expedition members get outdated and antique equipment &mdash; even down to their clothes &mdash; to bring to Area X. They're not allowed contemporary equipment like cellphones or laptops. The surveyor freaks out when she finds out that the one concession to their group, her assault rifle, is nothing more than 30 year old parts cobbled together. The reason for using old equipment is that whatever created Area X can sense the more advanced tech and attack the items along with whoever is using them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">But Not Too Foreign</a>: The psychologist is half-Native American, Control is half Latino, and the biologist is about quarter Asian.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>:<ul><li> Area X creates doppelgangers of the people who die in it, but they tend to be... off, with only superficial memories of the original and all with the same docile personality.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ghost Bird is off compared to the other clones. Normally the clones are indistinguishable from each other in what they know and how they act. Ghost Bird retains significantly more of the biologist's personality and memories of Area X.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">An Area X clone of the Director/Psychologist shows up back at the Southern Reach at the end of <em>Authority</em>. Despite looking exactly like her original self, the clone is so <em>off</em> that Control completely flips upon seeing it, and even the ever-loyal Grace is ready to shoot it down mere moments after its arrival.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>: The immortal plant and the cell phone that Control finds in the former director's office, which eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> allow Area X to expand past the old border</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">Clingy MacGuffin</a>: An otherwise ordinary broken cellphone brought back from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a> Area X, which always somehow returns after being thrown away. Control is stymied by his inability to get rid of it in <em>Authority</em>, and flashbacks in <em>Acceptance</em> reveal that it had previously behaved in a similarly clingy fashion towards the psychologist..</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Cloning Blues</a>:<ul><li> Features in <em>Authority</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The returned copy of the biologist realizes that she's not the original, and is depressed by it.

Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the psychologist</span> dies surprisingly early into the trilogy, at roughly 2/3s into <em>Annihilation</em>, but she remains a extremely important character over the entire series due to the fact she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was Southern Reach's director</span>, and a key figure to many Southern Reach employees, who are mayor characters in <em>Authority</em> and <em>Acceptance</em>.

The unknown is a source of horror and danger rather than discovery and possibility; the "pristine" nature of Area X compares favourably with the toxic pollution and social decay of the normal world; the narrative focus is on the characters' emotions and subjective perceptions; science and logical reasoning are of little to no use; and ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there are few to no real answers as to what has been going on the whole time</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy">Room Full of Crazy</a>:<ul><li> When Control is appointed director of the Southern Reach, he finds that the previous director's office includes a door that opens onto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a wall covered in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladHorror">scrawled writing</a> seen in the Area X tower as written by the Crawler</span>.

We never get to learn what happened to Whitby's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pet mouse</span>, either, although it can be inferred from his reaction to seeing it that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it is the dead mouse found in the locked drawer of the director's desk with the plant and cell phone.</span></li><li> It's never mentioned what happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Whitby, Lowry, Jackie Severance, Central, or the rest of the Earth and the human population</span> for that matter, though it's implied to not be very good.</li><li> In <em>Acceptance</em>, it's also left unclear as to whether or not <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlie</span> was able to escape the formation of Area X.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: While the series takes place in the United States, we never get firm details on where Area X, or for that matter anywhere else, is located.
