As a reward, Jim is granted a modest Barony, where he plans to contentedly live out his days &mdash; until the magical energy his deeds had earned overflows, forcing him to undertake the study of magic to control it.

When the possibility of doing a transfusion is brought up by James, one of the first hurdles is to figure out who gets to donate the blood, so that Daffyd didn't accidentally get the wrong blood type. With a bit of thinking, James is able to overcome this hurdle with some magic, and it is found that his own blood is safe for Daffyd, and again, using magic, is able to slowly transfer some of his own blood into the archer, saving his life.</li><li> Likewise, in <em>The Dragon and the Gnarly King</em>, Brian is injured due to a lance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> somewhat accidentally put through him by James himself</span>. While not as serious as Daffyd's earlier injury, Brian was still short of blood. Remembering his prior experience, James is able to figure out whose blood was good &mdash; once again, that blood was his own.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>:<ul><li> Brian is considered to possibly be the single best fighter in all of England,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wt3j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0wt3j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wt3j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">John Chandos actually makes a statement pretty close to a legal declaration of this</span> something he seriously needs because winning tournament prizes and ransoming horses and armor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">is the only way he can keep himself and his lands financially afloat</a> for most of the series. Unfortunately this also makes him a target of envy by other knights like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Sir Harrimore</a>.</li><li> Daffyd also shows signs of this, being an exceptional archer, and always competes against those who think themselves better with the bow, and on one occasion, wrestled two men in his father-in-law's outlaw band at the same time, breaking his arm in the attempt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Danielle in her first appearance, down to the cocky attitude.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: Pretty much all of the humans since alcohol is safer to drink than water. The king of England, especially. Dragons also have an intense love of wine and drink it by the keg.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: Medieval England but with magic, dragons, and fairies. And thanks to Jim, some 20th century technology that will no doubt make it even more different.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingPants">Dancing Pants</a>: The nature of the Hollow Men is along these lines, in that they are spirits that inhabit armor, or clothes, in order to have a body, with the upper ranks having full-plate armor of the current era, on down to those who wear basically the equivalent of a shirt and pants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">Archer Archetype</a>: Daffyd, a stoic, slightly-aloof loner with an unacknowledged heritage, who is as noted above, the greatest bowman in the current world, and justifiably proud of being such.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>: Averted, for the most part. James, Brian, and other knights, as well as men-at-arms, wear armor in order to protect themselves, and it usually keeps them alive. In fact, one scene in <em>The Dragon on the Border</em> has James, Brian, and Giles having to make sure that unarmored Daffyd stays between the three of them while fighting a group of Hollow Men.<ul><li> Played straight where anyone on the wrong end of Daffyd's arrows are concerned, as his arrows can go through plate armor. Justified in that he uses a bow that has a 200+ pound draw strength, and he crafts arrows that can penetrate armor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAssKickingChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAssKickingChristmas">An Ass-Kicking Christmas</a>: <em>The Dragon, the Earl, and the Troll</em> is set during the Christmas season, and includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTourney">a Tournament and a Joust</a>, which everyone loves to see, even the Bishop himself (although he's not supposed to approve of it).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>: Lyonesse and the Drowned Lands, both of which have been under the ocean for centuries, and both lands have people living in them. They are also neighbors, sharing a common border, but have issues with each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>: James has more than a few, usually when warning foes that it's a bad idea to mess with a magician. Of course, even the villains have their own, such as the case of Lord Eshen, leader of the Hallow Men, who warns a disguised James that, if killed, he'd be back to life in 48 hours.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>: Among the Companions, who are more often involved in fighting, Brian, an exceptional knight, and Daffyd, an exceptional archer, are just men who are very good with their weapons, who, alongside of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonKnight">Dragon Knight</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>, a powerful mage, a Talking Wolf (who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor">Canis Major</a> as far as most wolves are concerned), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals">selkie</a>, as well as a regular dragon, fight off a lot of supernatural creatures.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher">Badass Preacher</a>: The Bishop of Bath and Wells (Richard de Bisby), shows plenty of signs of this, and is rather eager to prove it, even willing to attack what he thought was a demonic wolf (Aragh actually), until James identified the wolf in question as a friend. He called out a lower ranked priest that had tried to "help" James under false pretenses (by blessing him, thus stripping him of his magic, not that he had any at the moment), forcing the priest to return back to their area, on foot, and begging his way back. He would later hold his own against deep-earth goblins, who had attacked him and James, and their guards, on their way to London.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>: Selkies can come back from the dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">twice.</a> However, they can only come back in human form once; if killed again, they will be modelocked in seal form.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>: James seems to become this with those who are his Companions, and they with each other. Should one of them be in danger, the rest will go and help out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneficialDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneficialDisease">Beneficial Disease</a>: In <em>The Dragon and The Fair Maid of Kent</em>, James comes down with both the Bubonic plague and a magician's-only condition from when he used up a lot of magic in a short period of time. For whatever reason, despite both of them making James incredibly weak, the two conditions also fought each other, which allowed James to have an easier time compared to someone with just the plague. Of course, opium was useful with the pain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Benevolent Boss</a>: As far as the people of the castle are concerned, James is seen as this, even in spite of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">bunny-eared</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">occasionally unusual tendencies</a>, in so far as Medieval England is concerned. In fact, they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">fight and die for him, if need be.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>: Never call a magician a sorcerer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Beware the Nice Ones</a>:<ul><li> Hobgoblins are cowardly and kindly goblins who have power over smoke and hide in chimneys. In one of the latter books, Jim's hob raises an army of hobgoblins who summarily wipe the floor with a much larger and more well-trained army of goblins.</li><li> James himself also qualifies; he's a peaceable, good-natured person who always prefers to solve disputes by diplomacy, and is very good at talking his way out of jams - but he's also a tall (a giant by the standards of the medieval era), powerfully-muscled, skilled athlete who's highly agile and is especially good at high jumps. He's a pretty rudimentary man of arms compared to Brian, but then, as noted above, Brian is probably the best swordfighter in England - and as the series progresses, James becomes a good enough fighter to defeat a belted knight in single combat (in his human form) and a sea serpent (in his dragon form), a creature bigger and more powerful than a dragon.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight">Black Knight</a>: In <em>The Dragon, The Earl, And The Troll</em>, James helps Mnrogar, a troll, become one of these, so that he could locate a disguised troll hidden in the Earl's castle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass">Bodyguarding a Badass</a>: James might be a magician, and have the ability to turn into a dragon, but when he travels around, he tends to have his Companions, or about half a dozen men-at-arms, near him. This is justified because there's times that James gets attacked by foes, and lacks the ability, or time, to utilize magic, or it's not practical to turn into a dragon at the moment, and he's only just good enough to utilize his mundane weapons to protect himself in a fight. In such cases, even having half a dozen men-at-arms tends to come in handy, to say nothing about his Companions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass">Brought Down to Badass</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>: When he runs out of his magic, or is unable to use it, or is unable to turn into a dragon, James is only good enough to use his weapons to just protect himself. That being said, he's still pretty smart, can talk himself out of trouble, and, oh, odds are that his Companions are either nearby, with him, or are just about to show up with extra help.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>: Most everyone else sees James, and Angie to a certain extent, as one of these. To begin with, James isn't real good with weapons, and, unlike most knights, dislikes going into battle, and seemed to be, according to Sir Harimore, nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedKnight">a jumped-up squire</a>, although that knight asked for forgiveness upon learning what James could really do. Likewise, even local magicians wonder about him. However, due to the fact that he can use magic, and can think up plans, to say nothing about his other-world experience, he is able to accomplish things thought impossible, such as being able to best superior Magicians, convince conflicting groups to work together, fight off difficult foes using simple tricks, and save England.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">Cheaters Never Prosper</a>: Zig-Zagged in the same scene even in <em>The Dragon and the Djinn</em>, during the dice game between Brian and Sir Mortimor.<ul><li> Sir Mortimor uses two pairs of dice, which are shaved in a certain way, one that causes the user to win, and one that causes the user to lose. In this way, Sir Mortimor stole a lot of the money that Brina was planning to use to help find Geronde's missing father.</li><li> James, while watching the rematch game, figures out how Sir Mortimor did this, and secretly begins to control the wins and losses himself, at least until the game is forced to stop, thankfully due to outside forces, because at this point, Sir Mortimor had figured that something was up, and had rudely called for the game to be halted, at which point James called out that he could smell smoke - Sir Mortimor had the sense to use this as the excuse as to why he halted the game. By this time, Brian had won most of his money back. That being said, James doesn't tell him that it was due to his magic, due to the fact that Brian wouldn't want to win by cheating.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder">Cloudcuckoolander's Minder</a>: In some situations, Brain and Daffyd, and their other companions, are this to James, mainly to keep him from making mistakes that might be embarrassing and potentially damaging to James' reputation. Justified in James' lack of knowledge of the way some things are, and they also justify it with the fact James being a Magician is a little out of touch with the common folk, along with the fact that he's not English.<ul><li> James himself is occasionally this to Brian, especially when Brian is gambling, or it looks like someone is trying to goad the knight into a fight that might cause trouble to James' plans.</li><li> A downplayed example occurs in <em>The Dragon Knight</em> when James takes his squire aside, telling him to keep an eye on Brian's relatively inexperienced squire, who will be leading the men while James and Brian are away, due to being of Rank, unlike James' squire, a former Chief Man-at-Arms. James' squire understands, promising to keep things on course. As it is, Brian has also given the same orders to his Chief Man-at-Arms. The two manage to do this, all without letting Brian's squire know that they were doing this.<ul><li> Oddly enough, it is while reflecting on this that James realizes that Brian and Giles had made a similar silent agreement where he was concerned, although he doesn't bring it up to them, and is touched that they care enough about him to keep an eye on him.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>: While a lot of people show this, James takes it up a notch, or two, from using his magic to hide his forces, letting archers thin out the ranks of the opposing forces a bit, faking magic to get his fighters to stay together in a charge, punching an enemy sorcerer in the guts before he can use his own magic, using makeup to disguise himself as a demon, to say nothing about running around and jumping and jump-kicking, among other things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfrontingYourImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfrontingYourImposter">Confronting Your Imposter</a>: Occurs twice in the series, where James and company encounter impostors of their allies.<ul><li> In <em>The Dragon Knight</em>, James finds out about an impostor of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prince Edward, who is giving life to the lie that he's joined the French</span>. In fact, the real one wishes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">confront this impostor himself.</a> While he, himself doesn't get the chance to do anything, he does find himself face-to-face with his fake. However, James, upon remembering a story he'd been told prior, manages to deal with the situation by splashing both the real one and the fake with water, causing the fake, who'd been made from enchanted snow, to melt. As it is, James felt like he'd murdered the fake.</li><li> In <em>The Dragon in Lyonnesse</em>, James and company encounter a fake of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dafydd</span>, standing before a rift. Once again, the real one wishes to confront the impostor, only for James to use the fact that he'd been previously warded to allow him to walk up to the fake, and cause it to distort and collapse, as it was little more than a magic illusion, along with the rift.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GogglesDoSomethingUnusual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GogglesDoSomethingUnusual">Goggles Do Something Unusual</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecsOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecsOfAwesome">Specs of Awesome</a>: During <em>The Dragon in Lyonesse</em> James creates a pair of glasses that serve multiple functions while in that mystical land. In a style similar to bifocals, the upper half reacts to bright light, and functions similar to tinted glasses, while the bottom half reacts to color, increasing its brightness, especially since Lyonesse is only safe if the scene is black-and-white to mortal eyes.<ul><li> James utilizes these glasses as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a> when trying to free Brian from the Bright Knight, and to beat said knight in a joust.</li><li> Later, when James starts seeing the color red, he knew that it was time for him and Brian to leave the land.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">Covers Always Lie</a>: While the covers do depict scenes in the books, in a number of cases, James was actually in his human form, not the dragon form shown on the cover. Then there's the fact that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">depending on the publisher, and even the artist</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou">James' dragon form is always different on the cover.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VertebrateWithExtraLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VertebrateWithExtraLimbs">Sometimes he has legs, arms and wings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatherFingers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatherFingers">sometimes one pair of legs and a pair of wings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDrawnToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDrawnToScale">and then there's times</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSizeMayVary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSizeMayVary">he's bigger than he's supposed to be</a>. Poor guy is all over the place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedWarrior">Cultured Warrior</a>: Due to the fact that he's from another land and that he's a magician, James will occasionally act as if he is one, defusing potential conflicts by speaking in mystical-sounding words and phrases that leave come people puzzled.<ul><li> Upon first meeting Brian in <em>The Dragon and The George</em>, after the knight decided to be one of James' Companions, there was some awkward silence, until James decided to ask about the knight's Social Security Number, saying that knowing the other's would be a good way to know if the other could be trusted, even coming up with one for the knight when the knight said that he didn't have one.</li><li> In <em>The Dragon and The Djinn</em>, James finds himself in the sights of an upset Sir Mortimor, who was previously having an argument with Brian, until James talks about weather pressure systems, whereupon Brian explained that James was a magician.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a>: Daffyd, an archer with no equal, kills foes from a distance, before the rest move in. James uses his magic to heal his companions and other allies as needed, along with other tricks. Brian, an exceptional knight, and gifted with his swordsmanship, tends to do the duty of going after those that are a serious danger to those who lack heavier armor, although James also does this at times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass">Dare to Be Badass</a>: Smrgol to Secoh. Secoh was rather cowardly, until Smrgol, who at the time had been crippled by a stroke, reminded the smaller dragon that he was a Dragon! And a Dragon is a Dragon!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>: Given the setting of the book, this sort of thing does happen. James and Angie, being from the late 20th century, often have to learn how to deal with things that others just take for granted.<ul><li> One instance is James' tendency to invite others, regardless of rank, to sit down with him. Servants and man-at-arms however, don't sit down with their lord and master, and thus feel uncomfortable when he makes the invitation. Angie basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">gives them an order to disobey said invitation</a>, much to their relief.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>:<ul><li> Danielle is not seen much after the second book, merely mentioned in passing, although she does reappear in person in the final book.</li><li> Angie swings back and forth between this and being a third protagonist. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the setting, since the Middle Ages were very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay In The Castle</a>. In some books like <em>The Dragon and The Djinn</em> or <em>The Dragon and The Fair Maid of Kent</em>, which are domestic, Angie plays a far greater role.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">Doing In the Wizard</a>: The laws of reality follow this. Magic that becomes too common stops being magic and starts being science. Consequently the Collegiate prizes the ability to create new magic above all others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonKnight">Dragon Knight</a>: If the name of the series hasn't given it away, James is a knight (or so he claimed to be) who can turn from a human into a dragon, and back again. He even has a dragon on his shield, as given to him by the King of England.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a>: Zig-Zagged quite a lot. Worthies are treated with dignity, while the lower classes get tossed into a ditch.<ul><li> This is why James and the Earl of Cumberland tend to square off. The Earl had wanted to bury the knights that had fallen in the big battle in <em>The Dragon Knight</em> in one grave, but James had promised <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Giles</span> that he'd bury that knight at sea, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which in fact restored that knight to life.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">The Dung Ages</a>: The reality of the medieval world, rammed home quite quickly to Jim. He uses magic to try to at least bring a little sanitation to his personal spaces, but has to deal with the rest of the world on its terms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>: The Dark Powers in general. Unlike most examples, they are helpless to do anything directly to the world; they instead hire, seduce or subvert others to do their bidding. Some major classes of demons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Such as Ahriman from <em>The Dragon and the Djinn</em></span>, also qualify.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Embarrassing Nickname</a>: The evil magician Jim fights in <em>The Dragon Knight</em> was known as "Stinky" to Carolinus from their time in school together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>: Happens a few times in the series &mdash; sometimes even the villains pull this off as well.<ul><li> Daffyd, a Welshman, has a chip on his shoulders where English bowmen are concerned, joined James and Brian in <em>The Dragon and the George</em> because he wanted to prove himself to Danielle that he was just as good as them. They became friends afterwards.</li><li> Sir Raoul, a French knight in <em>The Dragon Knight</em>, would rather see the English driven into the sea and fight them, as opposed to work with them, but the Mage Malvinne has corrupted the French court, and killed his family, and thus doesn't want him in power over his beloved France.</li><li> Sir Lachlan, a Scottish knight in <em>The Dragon on the Border</em>, wouldn't mind a war with England, if Scotland could win. However, while fighting on the defense against English aggression is one thing, invading England is another, and is foolish, which is why he's against fighting England. Then there's the issue with the French, who'd probably betray them.</li><li> Likewise, in <em>The Dragon on the Border</em>, James has to convince the Border Men and the Little Men to work together in order to fight the Hollow Men.</li><li> In <em>The Dragon At War</em> James has to convince the English Dragons and the French Dragons to, at the very least, make it look like they are working together against the Sea Serpents trying to invade England.</li><li> James attempted this between the titular Earl and Troll in <em>The Dragon, The Earl, and The Troll</em> in order to find a "hidden troll", but to say that negotiations fell through is an understatement.</li><li> In <em>The Dragon and the Djinn</em>, James and Brian have to work with Baiju, an Mongol, in the Middle East, along with a few others, in order to foil the Real Mastermind's plot.</li><li> Likewise, in <em>The Dragon and the Djinn</em>, James and Brian have to work with Sir Mortimor, in order to survive against an attack of Sallee Rovers, that is, Moroccan Pirates.</li><li> James forms one with Hill a Gnarly in "The Dragon and the Gnarly King".</li><li> In <em>The Dragon in Lyonesse</em>, the men of the Drowned Lands cooperate with King Arthur's knights, against an invading force commanded by the Earl of Cumberland.</li><li> Among the villains, most seem to work with the others, but they generally don't like each other, alongside the Dark Powers. In fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hugh de Bois</span> has worked alongside of the evil mage Malvinne, and later, worked alongside the Earl of Cumberland, Agatha Falon, Queen Morgan, and the Earl and Agatha had worked with the Gnarly King prior.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEnglish">Eternal English</a>: Discussed in the first book by Angie and Jim, the former of whom notices that their speech patterns are different than they're used to in the present day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsArmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsArmed">Everyone Is Armed</a>: Given the setting, most everyone is indeed armed, either with obvious weapons, hidden weapons, things that can be used as weapons, or there are weapons/things that can be used as weapons nearby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a>:<ul><li> The Earl of Cumberland is this to Prince Edward, as he is always trying to get the young prince in one sort of trouble or another.</li><li> Agatha Falon is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Evil Aunt</a> version where Robert Falon is concerned.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a>: After Jim regains his own body, Gorbash, the dragon whose body he inhabited, frequently takes the credit for Jim's first adventure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>: The Drowned Lands are elf-like, especially given the fact that a lot of the inhabitants are archers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanOfThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanOfThePast">Fan of the Past</a>: Jim was studying for his Medieval European studies doctorate before being tossed there. Even with his training he's still not aware of much of the day to day life of being a knight or running a castle, though, and before he arrived he <em>definitely</em> didn't realize that its politics and social expectations were at least as difficult and as serious as modern day America's.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Fish out of Temporal Water</a>: James, and Angie, are, at least initially, this.

Daffyd is an exceptional archer, although he is decent with a sword when he must use one, and is able to sneak around unnoticed, making him the Thief of the trio. James knows magic, can turn into a dragon, and is okay with a sword, making him the Mage of the trio.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingYourFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingYourFriend">Fighting Your Friend</a>: In <em>The Dragon and the Gnarly King</em>, Brian supports a tax-protest, and joins a group causing small troubles in order to get the taxes changed to something more favorable. James is under orders to support the side trying to stop the protest. When their respective groups meet in combat, James and Brian both try to avoid harming the other, but the closeness of their respective cavalry charges still result in James putting a lance into Brian.

He also tells Brian he's a baron from America. Later, Carolinus tells Jim there's no such thing as an evil Magician, but he later admits that he only said that because evil Magicians are technically called "Sorcerers". However, in <em>The Dragon At War</em>, Carolinus explains that sorcerers work alone, and have sold themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The Dark Powers</a> in return for learning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">more offensive and evil "counter-magic"</a> (as opposed to normal magic, which cannot be used for personal gain or any sort of evil).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault">Full-Frontal Assault</a>:<ul><li> In <em>The Dragon on The Border</em>, the Scottsman, Lachlan, fights naked when James' group attacks the party lead by the Frenchified-Scottsman, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacDougall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacDougall">Mac Dougall</a>.</li><li> Downplayed a bit, but early on, James would have to take his clothes off in order to turn into a dragon, or else he'd ruin them.

Embarrassing enough, the guy wore less armor than him, making James overconfident, until getting kicked forced him to his knees, with a sword to his throat, being forced to chose between surrendering or dying. Luckily, the outlaw Giles and his men were nearby, one of which put an arrow into that raider, saving James' life. Afterwards, Brian noticed that James was in a bit of pain, and upon learning of the injury, tells James that at least he won't die from it, and tells a man-at-arms to fetch some wine for James.

James is able to best him due to the differences in their respective armors, given that the armor worn by James was that of Medieval technology, while that of the other man was the sort worn by warriors a thousand years earlier. This is even mentioned during a conversation between James and Brian as part of a concern when the Dark Powers' forces, most of them being outlawed knights and the like, are about to face off against the Knights of the Round Table. Luckily, King Arthur's knights manage to prove victorious, with the outlaws fleeing, but this is mainly because they believed that God was on the side of the locals, especially since there was a lion and James, in dragon form, near King Arthur, as if the figures on the king's shield had came to life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a>:<ul><li> Possibly because of Jim, the history of medieval England is all off. Bits of the Renaissance have leaked in prematurely, such as early aqueducts/sewer systems, some medicine, blood transfusions, paned windows, more efficient indoor heating, and theatrical special effects. (It's all either managed or chalked up to magic, though.) Plague is ahead of schedule and noted events don't match the times they historically occurred. Carolinus dismisses this as the history books being wrong.</li><li> Jim is explicitly responsible for several changes, however. He may have blunted the Black Plague substantially, by explaining how the disease is transmitted by fleas, found on rats, even going so far as to suggest bringing in more cats in order to deal with them. He also taught his fellow knights a lot of songs they shouldn't quite have known.</li><li> The series implies, however, that these changes and discrepancies are all to the good; if History grows too strong and these chaotic elements are not introduced, the world lapses into Stasis.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToWinWithoutFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToWinWithoutFighting">To Win Without Fighting</a>: In, <em>The Dragon Knight</em>, James and Brian are staying at an inn.

The other knight challenges James to a fight, and James goes to meet him in the street. Knowing that the other knight was, most likely, better with a sword than himself, James claims that he <em>cannot</em> draw his sword, unless it's to first cross blades with that of a French knight. The other, so impressed by the sort of bravery that must be necessary to make such an oath, expresses his admiration. James even puts an end to any conflict by inviting the other knight, Sir Giles, to share the room with him and Brian, due to another oath he made that restricts him to the floor.

It also acts as some sort of magical bank that slightly increases the supply of magic via investment. It typically bosses Jim around, though Carolinus and later (once he graduates) Jim can intimidate it by threatening to pull their supply of magic from its management.

Then there's other instances, such as when he had a bunch of attacking sea serpents first doused in oil, and has a burning torch tossed upon them, causing them to roast, James feels sick to his stomach at having done so, despite it being necessary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">Who Wants to Live Forever?</a>: At the end of <em>The Dragon on the Border</em>, after defeating the Hollow Men, and their worm, James walks up to a dying Lord Eshan, who mentions that it has indeed been a long time, and that he's glad that he, and the other Hollow Men, can finally rest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">Worf Had the Flu</a>: There's been a few times where Brian and/or Daffyd have received an injury that prevents them from assisting James and the rest in any fighting. James often has to figure out how to make do without them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">Worst Aid</a>: Due to their relative lack of medical knowledge, even compared to that of the average person from the 20th century, James as a natural reluctance to let native "doctors" treat him or his friends, for this very reason. As it is, in <em>The Dragon at War</em>, Carolinus has a bad encounter with a couple of "so-called healers", who are excessively rough on him, especially given his age, and he probably would have died from their "so-called treatment", had James, Angie, and some of his men-at-arms not arrived to take him to their place, and even they wouldn't have saved him, had John Chandos and Sir Giles not shown up just then to scatter the group of vagabonds preventing them from leaving with the mage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Brian seems to see Sir Harimore as this, as they are both equally skilled with their weapons, and have had more than one encounter, wherein they've bested each other, something few others have been able to do.</li><li> Dragons also see humans as this, especially after the battle of St. George against a dragon. Initially, dragons were upset at not only being the loser, but also being the villain. After a century of indignation, most came around to the idea that George was a formidable opponent, and would talk about what they themselves would have done. As a result, dragons started to call humans "Georges".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHurtAChild">Wouldn't Hurt a Child</a>: Among the vows that Brian took, they were to not to harm women, children, members of the church, and to help them if they were in need of aid.</li></ul><hr>
