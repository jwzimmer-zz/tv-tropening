On the one hand, as the Warden of Demonreach, he's safe on the island, and Demonreach is helping him by suppressing the pain the parasite is causing him. On the other hand, as a result, Harry can't leave the island, and none of his messages to Molly are getting through. Then, of course, things get worse: Mab shows up, and she's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse">an offer he can't refuse</a> for him.</p><p>The offer?

Naturally, Harry's not exactly jumping to accept, but if he refuses, Mab will do nothing... and the Parasite will not only kill him, but once it's free, it'll go after everyone he cares about, starting with his daughter. But there's a twist: Mab doesn't just want Harry to go help Nicodemus rob the vault. She wants him to help Nicodemus rob the vault... and then screw him over in any and every way possible.

For example, a place being altered by fire or natural events would change the physical aspects. On the metaphysical level, if the location was altered in a certain way, like being the site of a murder or like opening a previously-secret area to the public, this would probably cause that secret area it connected to in the Nevernever to then be unreachable from that location on Earth. In this case, the problem is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in order to create a Way into the secure vault of the Lord of the Underworld, the crew has to first break into a secure vault of a lord of the underworld in the physical realm (being Chicago, they go with the vault of a criminal lord, aka Marcone), without compromising the integrity of the vault in anyway that would make it <em>in</em>secure.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">Spot the Imposter</a>: Deirdre notes that while her mother may buy Grey's disguise as Nicodemus for a few minutes, her Fallen companion, Imariel, will notice Anduriel's lack of presence far more easily.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster">The Spymaster</a>: It is noted that Nicodemus is very good at gathering information. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Any shadow cast by a living being can be possessed by his Fallen and used to listen to everything being said.

Michael notes that the last time someone tried to hurt her, Harry destroyed the entire Red Court, one of the most powerful organizations in the supernatural world, so no one is going to be stupid enough to do that again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, after Nicodemus kills his own daughter, he is in a damaged enough mental state to think that this is a good idea. It doesn't work, though.</span></li><li> Played with. Initially, it seems like Nicodemus is going to ignore everything Harry says, even when he brings up good points about the problems with the operation. He decides to take them seriously after all, and even mentions that it would be foolish to hire experts and not take their advice into consideration.</li><li> Upon discovering that Harvey's office is in the same building as a bank, Deirdre tries to continue with the original smash-and-grab plan. Harry and Grey both stop her, noting that it would cause far too much trouble, and opt for a stakeout instead.

Note that Ascher had Lasciel riding shotgun in her head and Lasciel knew everything Lash said and did to tempt Harry and knew what that Lash learned about Harry.

Giving him a new vessel for Bob to <em>repay a debt, <strong>exactly like a fae</strong></em>, which Butters also calls him out on. Though Butters' objections are somewhat blunted by the fact that the first thing Harry <em>actually</em> does is ask him about his relationship with Andi, it's still perfectly understandable that he would forget that from all the stress he's been experiencing recently and virtually every other point he raises is completely valid.</li><li> At least one person brings up the point that Harry took out most of the Fellowship of St. Giles along with the Red Court.
