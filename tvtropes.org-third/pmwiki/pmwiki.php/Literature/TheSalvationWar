By late 2019, he appears to have changed his mind, with the third story being published one part at a time on an uncertain schedule. Though this story cannot be monetized either, the author is writing it anyway, albeit at a slower pace, out of a desire to finally continue the story.

Harpies also have acidic, flammable blood. The coloration is likely a result of secondary pigments in the blood, since judging by their genetics they are almost certainly an evolutionary offshoot of the hominid family from Earth; they should have hemoglobin in their blood. Angels' blood isn't immune to the trope either. Sometimes it's red, more often it's white or silver. It seems that daemon and angelic blood pigment is also a type of blood group.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a>: Some of the physical laws, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapAround">especially relating to direction</a> are... different in Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>: Turns out there's nothing supernatural about demons or angels: they're flesh-and-blood organisms from parallel dimensions to ours, ultimately making what would be a story about the biblical apocalypse this instead, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyThwartedAlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyThwartedAlienInvasion">easily dealt-with one at that</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">head mason of Yahweh's palace</span> ends up being in charge of Heaven by the end of the second book. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned">Just as Planned</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: The Message came around in early 2008, so everything since then.

That was why sub-munitions made in South Africa were delivered to China for installation in 227mm rockets that were shipped in Greek freighters to Hell where they were issued to American MLRS batteries that gained their mobility from oil that had been drilled in Saudi Arabia and refined in Singapore before being carried by Norwegian tankers to Dutch-built storage facilities on the shores of Hell. Early in the war, at least three economists were reputed to have committed suicide after trying to work out how to pay for everything.</em></div></li><li> America also ends up being more or less in charge of the entire H.E.A., with General Petraeus being its Supreme Commmander.

Two hundred years ago, smoothbore line-of-sight cannons were the most powerful weapon that mankind could field.

Mildly subverted within the story, as the difference was cultural, though this is huge.
