The three books are:</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>The Paradise Snare</em> (1997)</li><li> <em>The Hutt Gambit</em> (1997)</li><li> <em>Rebel Dawn</em> (1998)</li></ul><p>As the title might suggest, the stories focus on Han Solo, and specifically on his adventures in the ten or so years leading up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, as he goes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchin</a> and petty thief, to Imperial pilot, to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue">Loveable Rogue</a> we all know and love. Along the way, he gathers friends and allies both new and familiar; Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> all appear for the first time in <em>The Hutt Gambit</em>, for example, and Han doesn't acquire the <em>Falcon</em> until <em>Rebel Dawn</em>.</p><p>Confusingly, this is the <em>second</em> trilogy of books to focus on Han Solo's early life. Nearly twenty years earlier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDaley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDaley">Brian Daley</a> wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloAdventures">The Han Solo Adventures</a></em>, three stand-alone stories about Han's escapades as a smuggler. Crispin retroactively fitted Daley's books into her series so that they now canonically take place during three chapters in the middle of <em>Rebel Dawn</em>. So the chronology goes:</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="indent"><em>The Paradise Snare</em> &rarr; <em>The Hutt Gambit</em> &rarr; The beginning of <em>Rebel Dawn</em> &rarr; <em>The Han Solo Adventures</em> &rarr; The rest of <em>Rebel Dawn</em>.</div><p>Similarly, Crispin set <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLandoCalrissianAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLandoCalrissianAdventures">The Lando Calrissian Adventures</a></em> during and after <em>The Hutt Gambit</em>; Han meets Lando just before those stories begin.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>The Han Solo Trilogy</em> provides examples of:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: All of Han's girlfriends over the course of the series. Salla Zend is a gunrunning smuggler, and Xaverri has a day job as an illusionist but also runs cons against Imperials with Han's help. When Han first meets Bria Tharen, she is a slave addicted to the Ylesian priests' Exultation emanations, but in the course of breaking her addiction she discovers the cause of the Rebellion and becomes a high-ranking commando and spy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: In regards to Durga, as previously seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallistaTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallistaTrilogy">Darksaber</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em>. Much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronAllston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronAllston">Aaron Allston</a> did for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCourtshipOfPrincessLeia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCourtshipOfPrincessLeia">Warlord Zsinj</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a>, Crispin takes a one-dimensional villain created by another author and turns him into a more complex character.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement">Addiction Displacement</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed">Discussed</a>.

However, it might been felt her zeal as an anti-slavery Rebel is itself kind of an addiction itself, and she admits finding a cause was what most helped in her recovery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Crispin does the impossible and makes Jabba the Hutt somewhat <em>likable</em>. Jabba seems to have a genuine soft spot for Han, he's better than most of his fellow Hutts at least, and they consider him deranged due to his fetish for humanoid females. Perhaps this is because Jabba is indeed ruthless, but also <em>fair</em> in his dealings with his underlings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">Analogy Backfire</a>: Imperial governor Sarn Shild gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> calling for a crackdown on the Hutts, culminating in a pledge that they will be <em>brought to their knees!</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller">"Um... figuratively speaking, of course."</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">And Now You Must Marry Me</a>: Ganar Tos, Teroenza's servant, has a creepy desire for Bria. While at first she's not bothered too much by it, since he doesn't do anything, before she knows it he's bringing her before Teroenza to get married. At no point is she asked for consent, and it's clear neither one cares. Bria only manages to delay this by insisting on following Corellian custom, which requires the bride to wear a green dress. In the time it takes them to procure one, she's able to escape with Han.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>:<ul><li> Han is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who is always claiming that he sticks his neck out for no one and is only interested in profit, but does the right thing when the chips are down regardless. He gathers friends and allies because of his hidden altruism&mdash;rescuing Chewie from slavery and taking in Jarik, a Nar Shaddaa street urchin, for example.</li><li> Bria is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero">Classical Anti-Hero</a> in <em>The Paradise Snare</em> (held in slavery by addiction and only able to escape because of Han) and progresses to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero">Unscrupulous Hero</a> in the early Rebellion, where even by the standards of an insurgent group her methods are harsh.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">Arc Welding</a>: These books followed on quite a bit of previous lore on Han's past from various other sources, and tried to incorporate and integrate much of it, sometimes requiring minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcons</a> in the process. Some of this reaches into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a> at times, referencing incredibly obscure things such as the very earliest licensed comic books, while others concern quite major events in the history of the setting. At the same time, the trilogy still leaves many things unexplored, presumably to leave it open for other authors in the future (or George Lucas himself, if he wanted to do anything with it), or else due to the writer's own preferences. There is almost nothing on Han's years at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">Military Academy</a>, for example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuysDoTheDirtyWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuysDoTheDirtyWork">Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work</a>: How <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Garris Shrike</span> meets his end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Han can't bring himself to shoot Shrike in cold blood, even though he knows that Shrike is a danger to him and he's trying to make himself pull the trigger. The problem is solved for him when another bounty hunter shoots and kills Shrike, so that <em>he</em> can collect the bounty on Han.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a>: As part of her work with the Corellian Resistance, Bria serves as this to Moff Sarn Shild (under a false name), since his sexual tastes aren't for human females. It is implied he likes members of other species of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>, which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">speciesist</a> Empire he serves wouldn't tolerate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory">Been There, Shaped History</a>: Bria is part of the Rebel unit that steals the plans for the first Death Star, before transmitting them to Princess Leia's ship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The unit swallows poison pills to prevent imminent capture and interrogation by the Empire.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">Better to Die than Be Killed</a>:<ul><li> Moff Sarn Shild kills himself after his failed attack on Nar Shaddaa. Having received word that the Emperor has summoned him back to Coruscant and made it clear he is <em>most</em> displeased, Sarn figures that anything would be better than facing Palpatine's wrath&mdash;and almost certainly a slow and agonizing death. Given just how sadistic Palpatine famously is and that he <em>knew</em> the Moff was planning to rebel against him,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xgu1');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0xgu1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xgu1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though Shild doesn't know this, Palpatine intentionally set him up to fail.</span> it's very likely that Shild was right.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After transmitting the plans to Princess Leia's ship, the surviving members of Bria's unit (including Bria herself) all kill themselves by taking poison pills rather than to risk being later captured and tortured into giving up the information by the Empire, then no doubt being killed.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualDialogue">Bilingual Dialogue</a>: Han is incapable of speaking shyriiwook, Chewbacca's language. Chewie can't speak Basic. Both can understand the other just fine however so they get along with no problem (a surprisingly large number of other people also appear to know shryiiwook too). Han also had this earlier with Jalus Nebl, a Sullustan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>: Hutts, like slugs (their closest real-world equivalent, which is also used as an insult for them), are <a class="urllink" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Slug#Reproduction">hermaphrodites<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with both male and female sex organs. After reproducing they identify as female, but apparently can go back to identifying as male later (as Durga's parent Aruk and Jabba's parent Zorba do).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>: The Rebels aren't nearly the paragons of virtue they are in the films, but several key members who canonically steer it in a more honorable direction haven't joined the movement yet, and they don't even become the Rebel <em>Alliance</em> until the last book (with the unification of three major groups), so for most of the series, there's lots of different "rebel" groups that are largely disconnected from each other, and no one to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> speech if any of them go too far. In particular, the Corellian Resistance's Red Hand Squadron only gives no quarter to slavers, so it's more sympathetic than it might otherwise be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a>: For <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bria Tharen and her Red Hand Squadron</span>. Boba Fett later confirms <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her death</span> when he brings news of it to Han.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a>: A number of them are sent after Han over stealing from the Besadii clan, including Boba Fett, who becomes his nemesis. Bria is also hunted for freeing many Besadii slaves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Brainwashed</a>: Ylesian Pilgrims undergo brainwashing into the scam One and the All cult through them combining Exultation (a highly addictive sensation they receive from the priests that is claimed to have a divine source) with a diet which leaves them always malnourished, thus more malleable than usual.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">Call-Forward</a>:<ul><li> In the first book, Han Solo's accounts are flagged by Corellian Security Force Agent Hal Horn, the father of Corran Horn from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a>.</li><li> Greedo is noted as being a terrible shot and an idiot who will most likely get himself killed.</li><li> A subtler one: Jabba is already well known to enjoy humanoid females, and after meeting with Bria to coordinate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the attack on Ylesia</span>, comments that he wouldn't mind having her as a dancer. Han replies that it might not be wise to try to force a trained and experienced Rebel commander into that situation.

She'd planned on being a museum curator and was engaged to a young man who came from a very wealthy family, but didn't feel happy with either of these. Her mother was furious when she had broken off their engagement after she caught her fiance cheating on her, and demanded Bria get back together with him because of the "great match" the pair had in her mind. Bria refused to do so though, and when she attended a service by some missionaries from Ylesia, experiencing Exultation, it felt right to her. She sold her jewelry to buy passage, left Corellia, and became a Pilgrim on Ylesia. However, it turned out the entire religion is a scam to get slaves, first processing illegal spice on the planet and then sold off elsewhere. Her addiction to the Exultation and devastation at learning that it was lies took Bria a long time to shed. Eventually she found another purpose however, joining the Corellian Resistance and helping liberate other Ylesian slaves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu?</a>: Not a supernatural example, but the fact that Han kills a Hutt lord in <em>The Paradise Snare</em> raises some impressed eyebrows among those who've heard of it.

His rival Jiliac hopes that he follows this advice, as she has no desire to be in competition with Black Sun.</li><li> Darth Vader is spoken of only in fearful, hushed tones. When he's coming to "speak" with Admiral Greelanx after his defeat, it's clearly terrifying (and for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">very good reasons</a>, of course).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>:<ul><li> Danalis, one of the other street urchins recruited by Garris Shrike, killed herself after finally realizing he would never have her face fixed in return for her work (she'd been horribly disfigured as a child).</li><li> Bria briefly contemplates suicide looking over the edge of a turbolift on Coruscant and realizing how easy it would be fall off, then she'd no longer have to suffer from her addiction, before Han pulled her back.</li><li> Moff Sarn Shild kills himself after his fleet is defeated at Nar Shaddaa and he's been summoned for an inquiry on Coruscant, knowing that he's just delaying the inevitable otherwise.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>: Durga challenges Jiliac after he learns she poisoned his parent.

He's distraught when Aruk is killed, and hunts down the murderers.

Admittedly they have no way of knowing that he's fallen in love with one of the pilgrims in the meantime, but it still says something about them that they can't imagine that anyone "strong minded" could be offended by the revelation.</li><li> In a minor example, the female slaver who Bria encounters during her raid on the <em>Helot's Shackle</em> just cannot fathom the idea that Red Hand Squadron want to <em>free</em> slaves, not steal them for sale later. This gives Bria a distraction as the woman attempts to comprehend the idea, and she shoots her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>:<ul><li> While playing a high-stakes card game, Lando offers Han a marker for "any ship on [his] lot" when he runs short of cash. As he doesn't specify that he means his <em>inventory</em>, Han uses the marker to claim Lando's personal ship, the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>, which Lando had left parked in said lot. Lando tries to object, but Han presses him on his literal statement, and Lando unhappily agrees.</li><li> When the Battle of Nar Shaddaa turns against the Imperials, Admiral Greelanx orders his capital ships to retreat and abandon their TIE fighters. One of his captains, Soontir Fel, objects and requests permission to wait and retrieve the fighters (being an ex-TIE pilot himself), but Greelanx angrily says his order stands. Fel complies and orders his helmsman to set course out of the system, but to fly as slow as possible so that the TIEs can catch up and dock with his dreadnaught.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression">Explosive Decompression</a>: In <em>The Paradise Snare</em>, Han remembers having to clean up after someone cycled the airlock to kill themselves, and it was apparently quite messy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedDisarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedDisarming">Extended Disarming</a>: In <em>The Hutt Gambit,</em> Boba Fett is forced to disarm, which takes several minutes and produces a large pile of weapons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFagin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFagin">The Fagin</a>: Garris Shrike doesn't have a whole gang of children (most of his underlings are older), but raises Han in this way, having him steal, con, and participate in illegal swoop races for him while becoming progressively more cruel and abusive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">Faking the Dead</a>: Han fakes his death by leaving the fake ID he'd used on a dead bounty hunter who came after him (he killed the man in self-defense) then erasing the guy's face with a blaster bolt. However, this only works for so long, and later Teroenza finds out he's alive, so more bounty hunters come after him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia">False Utopia</a>: Ylesia turns out to be one for Pilgrims who settle there. While they have hard work, the Exultation gives them a feeling of intense pleasure and makes them feel united to the One. Unbeknownst to them though, in actual fact the Exultation is not divine or spiritual at all, it's just a natural mating call t'landa Til males use which if done on other species will affect them in this way. Han sees through it right away, but he isn't a believer. Worse, in the end they're all sold as slaves, and sent to mines or the Imperials' military brothels. Since the Exultation is very addictive though, most of them don't want liberation (they're not aware of the rest until it's too late).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a>: Spice, which has various types and is highly restricted, thus very profitable for smuggling. There's the Exultation as well, which isn't an actual substance but in fact the mating call male t'landa Til use with a drug-like effect on members of other species. It is equally addictive though, and used to hook "pilgrims" in their fake religion on Ylesia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>: The Hutts consider themselves the superior species, and thus entitled to cheat and exploit the "lesser" ones. Xizor seems to share these sentiments, and uses this to flatter Hutts by noting that their species are cold-blooded and therefore rational, rather than hot-blooded and given to emotions as mammals like humans are. It goes both ways, of course, as the Empire bases its rule at least partly on the idea of human supremacy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fetish">Fetish</a>: Jabba's taste for scantily clad humanoid females is brought up several times. It turns out to be something viewed as perverse and bizarre by fellow Hutts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a>: Desilijic and Besadii, the two most powerful Hutt clans/crime families.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalAgeOfMajority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalAgeOfMajority">Fictional Age of Majority</a>: Alderaan and Corellia both have seventeen as the age of majority. Winter and Bria note this in conversation, while the former feels it's too young as she had no sense then. At that age, Bria ran away from home and joined a religion which turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion">a front for slavery</a>, nearly leading her into being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sex slave</a> for the rest of her life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromCamouflageToCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromCamouflageToCriminal">From Camouflage to Criminal</a>: The trilogy shows how Han was an officer in the Imperial Navy, and what happened to cause him to leave and begin a life of crime. Or rather <em>resume</em> it, since he had already worked as a con artist, drug smuggler and thief before. He was blacklisted from legal piloting with his dishonorable discharge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>: Bria Tharen is this, from the point of view of the t'landa Til and their Besadii overlords. At the beginning of the trilogy, she's just one humble and self-effacing pilgrim among thousands. By the end of the first book, she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">indirectly caused Han Solo, Muurgh, and Mrovv to escape with her, stealing a number of the high priest's precious valuables and killing the Hutt overseer of the colony</span>. By the third book, she's become a Rebel Commander whose squadron specializes in freeing slaves and gives no quarter to their owners, which is beginning to put a serious dent in Besadii's trade. And by the end of that book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she and an entire Rebel force come back to Ylesia and destroy the entire operation for good, along with Besadii's main source of income. Making matters even worse is that Durga had just had to indebt himself further and further to underworld kingpin Xizor by asking him for help and protection against her raids, and he was planning to pay off his debt by sharing Ylesian profits. With those profits gone, any hope of keeping his independence from Xizor disappears, and he becomes little more than another one of his underlings, as seen in his next appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em>.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheQuietOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheQuietOnes">Beware the Quiet Ones</a>, <em>indeed</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>: This is basically <em>the</em> driving force of Hutt culture, to the point that even valuing close family over profit is looked down upon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination">Half-Breed Discrimination</a>: Han surmises that Shug Nix has suffered from this due to his mixed background given Shug's wariness when they first meet, probably from Imperial officials mostly, as the Empire views anyone of such heritage as second-class citizens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a>: Shug Nix is the son of a Human father and mother who is from another species.

They're also initially unaware that it's even slavery, as they've been scammed into believing the religion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasAType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasAType">Has a Type</a>: Han with anti-Imperial revolutionaries. His first love Bria becomes one in the second book, while another lover, Xaverri, is already one when he meets her, and, of course, Leia in the movies and later Legends stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbrokenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbrokenBadass">Heartbroken Badass</a>: Han, after Bria leaves him at the end of the first book.

Of course, we know he ends up with Leia in the end, though it still holds up during the trilogy. Interestingly, all his other girlfriends are dark-haired.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>: Dewlanna gives her life to protect Han.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide">Heroic Suicide</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bria and Red Hand Squadron</span> take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyanidePill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyanidePill">suicide pills</a> to prevent the vital information they have being tortured out of them by the Imperials when facing imminent capture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>: Han and Chewbacca from the beginning of book 2 onward.

Since there's no honor working with a liar, the contract is voided, and he works with Han to go against them.

She was constantly pushing her to make a "good match", no matter what Bria thought about it. Even after Bria found out that her fiancee had cheated and broke up with him, her mother insisted on her getting back together with him, and wasn't happy with her life choices generally, always belittling them. All this led to Bria having very low self-esteem, contributing to her running away to become a pilgrim on Ylesia (which, it turns out, is a scam for enslaving people).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">My Girl Is Not a Slut</a>: Han is very upset when he finds Bria is the (apparent) concubine of a Moff, saying he never imagined she'd be so "cheap".

Most of the time, Hutts are just called by male pronouns. When either pregnant or afterward though, they're called by female ones. It seems this shifts back at some point, as Hutts like Aruk who have reproduced in the past use male pronouns currently. This isn't explored much, with Han just being baffled when a Hutt client's gender changes (he shifts pronouns/honorifics in tandem), though clearly presented as part of their alien nature since he thinks about how weird the entire thing is to him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>:<ul><li> During Han's painful memory of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsigniaRipOffRitual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsigniaRipOffRitual">Insignia Rip-Off Ritual</a>, he makes mention of his Corellian Bloodstripes (the red and yellow stripes that he wears down the seam of his pants). It's an honor given out by the government of Corellia, so it's the only one he gets to keep, but we're never told just <em>what</em> he did to earn it. Even in later novels we're never told what happened except that it was a very harrowing and painful experience that happened over several days. Furthermore, there are two classes of Bloodstripes (Red for First Class and Yellow for Second Class) and he's earned them both.</li><li> <em>Rebel Dawn</em> also provides an explanation for the Noodle Incident mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> (where Lando appears furious at Han when they meet again over "what you pulled"). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Corellian Resistance screws Han and his smuggler pals out of their share of the treasure owed to them in the raid on Ylesia, even turning their guns on them, because they need it to fund their search for the Death Star plans, along with the rebellion in general.

We never see or hear of a single one who isn't like this. "Kajidic" is the word for their guiding philosophy, loosely translated as "Somebody's got to have it, why not us?" and also used for both their clans or syndicates. Their entire <em>culture</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">literally revolved around engaging in organized crime</a>.

This gets the man killed as he's shot when stormtroopers try to stop Han escaping. Yes, he didn't intend it, but it's probably the worst thing Han does in the trilogy.

They go from planet to planet and recruit people. People who have experienced it and are not strong enough to resist it are drawn into it and become addicted. The pilgrims become slaves in the Ylesian spice factories. The "Exultation" is a major part of their day, when the pilgrims get their daily fix. These poor slaves are completely brainwashed and cannot live without their drug. The faux religion that the t'landa Til have established is just a ploy to get free slaves and spice.

Han runs away from his first job as a pilot for the Besadii Hutts when he discovers that their main business is slavery (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">freeing a slave he'd fallen in love with in the process</span>); later he's cashiered from the Imperial Navy after freeing another slave from his brutal Imperial taskmaster <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (Chewbacca, who escapes to pledge Han a life debt for it)</span>; and specifically only accepts a job smuggling for Jabba after he's made it clear that he will never transport slaves for him. Bria and Chewbacca, being former slaves themselves, naturally share this outlook <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is a big part of the reason Bria joins the Rebellion</span>, but contempt for slavery is widespread even beyond that&mdash;Lando's way of expressing contempt for bounty hunters, for instance, is that they're "on a level with slavers." Given that the protagonists and their friends are all drug smugglers, con artists, and other "scoundrels," this is arguably a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>. Even <em>Boba Fett</em> feels this way, though it didn't stop him working for slavers, or taking a bounty on Bria for freeing them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a>: Han calls Bria a lowest-level streetwalker in Rodian when he's mad at her, based on her past (fake) relationship with a Moff. She's so appalled at this that Bria's driven to tears and nearly draws down on him. Note too that she wasn't actually promiscuous at all&mdash;the accusation was enough.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoCalledCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoCalledCoward">The So-Called Coward</a>: Lando, being primarily a gambler, con man, and ladies' man, occasionally gets this treatment from those who don't know better. Boba Fett is genuinely shocked when Lando, offered a chance to escape him, refuses to take it unless his other prisoner, Bria Tharen, is also released.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath">Sound-Only Death</a>: Vader Force-choking Greelanx for taking a bribe and throwing the battle of Nar Shaddaa. Han listens to it while hidden in a nearby closet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>: Recurring throughout the trilogy. In <em>The Paradise Snare</em>, some of them are hired by Desilijic to attack Besadii spice shipments, with Han barely escaping one of the raids. In <em>The Hutt Gambit</em>, a pirate fleet commanded by Drea Renthal is hired by the Hutts to defend Nal Hutta from Imperial attack, siding with the smugglers fighting them near Nar Shaddaa. In <em>Rebel Dawn</em>, the same fleet attacks a star liner carrying Boba Fett and his captives, Lando and Bria: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because of her past relationship with Lando, she pressures Fett into releasing them</span>. Also most smugglers are basically pirates themselves according to Lando.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teroenza</span>, towards the Besadii clan. Not at first, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">being unappreciated by his superiors, having an idiot as his immediate boss, being frustrated in his desire for revenge against Han Solo</a>, and realizing that he can run the Ylesia operation perfectly well without oversight leads him to become this: when Desilijic offers him a chance to turn on Aruk, he jumps at the offer.</li><li> Sarn Shild, the Imperial governor of the sector including Hutt space, is this towards Emperor Palpatine, dreaming of breaking the Outer Rim off from the Empire to become an independent nation, and possibly even then going on to conquer the rest of the galaxy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, Palpatine is aware of his ambition (and may even be using the Force to encourage it) and sets him up for a fall.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarshipLuxurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarshipLuxurious">Starship Luxurious</a>: The <em>Queen of Empire,</em> a two-kilometer long cruise ship, is the epitome of luxury. It was raided by pirates.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mako Spince</span> is a pretty likable character here. In fact, he's one of the heroes of the story. In the third book, however, he gets captured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">tortured</a>, and crippled for life. When Han and Lando visit him, he refuses to speak to them and makes it clear by his body language that he wants them to leave. When he next encounters Han years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire">Dark Empire</a></em>, he sells his old friend out to the Empire. Not because he's under any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">pressure to do so</a> as Lando was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, but just for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">credits</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a>: The Empire during the events of the books as it becomes increasingly repressive. As Han reflects, tax people to death paying for your war machine, then massacre them just for peacefully protesting this, and naturally many will find armed revolt is the only option (plus Imperial officers that retain a conscience will defect).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">The Syndicate</a>: Black Sun is an interstellar criminal organization so powerful it even has entire mercenary companies in its employ. The Hutt kajidics are this on a smaller scale, and even they fear Black Sun (before Durga, none were dumb enough to get into bed with them however).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeetotaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeetotaler">The Teetotaler</a>: Bria is revealed to not drink as she's afraid she'll like it too much. Having been addicted to something before, she's afraid the same thing might happen again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Glitterstim</a> temporarily gives users this ability. Bria uses some to reveal that Teroenza, the High Priest of her religion, really is just a con artist who made the entire thing up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime">Their First Time</a>: It is heavily implied that Bria and Han have sex on the Togorian beach for the first time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesCant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesCant">Thieves' Cant</a>: "Trader talk." A sort of dialect that mixes multiple languages together and is very heavy on colloquialisms and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle">You No Take Candle</a>. Han uses it to speak with Jalus Nebl, a fellow pilot for the Ylesian operation, when he wants to make sure their bosses can't understand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">Third-Person Person</a>:<ul><li> Muuurgh refers to himself this way at first, before Han helps him learn the use of the personal pronoun. Mrrov, however, doesn't do this, so it's probably just that Muuurgh is still learning the finer points of Basic.</li><li> Jalus Nebl does this in his own language.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a>: Lando, Salla and one Alderaanian cop are the only black Humans in the books. Xaverri might be darker than white as well, though it's unclear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant">Three Laws-Compliant</a>: The R2 unit on the <em>Ylesian Dream</em> where Han stows away. It has to safeguard the life of a sentient being, and he shows the course will be too long for him to survive on the available oxygen. However, this conflicts with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">restraining bolt</a> it has preventing a course change, until he removes the device.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TribeOfPriests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TribeOfPriests">Tribe of Priests</a>: All clergy in the One and the All faith are males of the t'landa Til species. In fact, many Pilgrims don't even seem to know their species' name, and just call them "Priests". This is because only males of their kind are capable of the Exultation the faith is built around&mdash;it's really a mating call to t'landa Til females that also has a very pleasurable effect on other beings too, with the whole religion being a scam.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">Thrown Out the Airlock</a>: Someone used this method to kill themselves in Han's childhood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">Truly Single Parent</a>: Hutts, being hermaphrodites capable of asexual reproduction, often are this. Their children refer to them as simply "my parent" in this case, rather than "mother" or "father" (Hutts will also switch gender identities during pregnancy, so this makes sense).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalUniverseTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalUniverseTime">Universal Universe Time</a>: Coruscant provides "Galactic Standard Time" with other planets' days etc. given in its units. However, the local time is also provided. In any case, Han finds it difficult to adjust while on a planet whose day is only ten "standard hours" long (far less than his home world, apparently).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight">Played straight</a> with Bria's mother and brother. Once Han returns Bria to her family, as soon as they discover he hasn't been entirely honest about his past, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">report him to the police</span>. Subverted with Bria's father, who opposes this and actually gives Han a generous loan to help him on his way, and with Bria herself. It's implied that the father being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a> who also started out as a lowly pilot has a lot to do with his being sympathetic towards Han, and just generally less of an all-around snob. He also had a somewhat checkered past too, according to Bria, explaining his sympathy for Han.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">Utopia</a>: Alderaan has no pollution, little crime and no wars. Han is very dubious that it's true at first on being told this. However, after unsuccessfully trying to sell his glitterstim cargo there with no luck (as there isn't a market for narcotics on Alderaan) he admits it really is the case. Despite having little crime though, the police still exist though, as Han is discovered trying to sell his cargo by an Alderaanian undercover cop and warned off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VowOfCelibacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VowOfCelibacy">Vow of Celibacy</a>:<ul><li> Bria took such a vow as a Pilgrim on Ylesia, which means she's upset when Han kisses her and they have a mutual attraction. She also later tries to use this when Ganar Tos is having Teroenza marry them but the latter simply waves this aside by releasing her from it. After she's escaped with Han, having already learned that their religion was fake, Bria naturally no longer feels bound by this, and the pair have sex.</li><li> Soon after arriving on Nar Shaddaa for the first time in <em>The Hutt Gambit</em>, Han gets propositioned by an old Twi'lek woman and claims to have taken a vow of abstinence to get her off his back. She just looks amused.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss">Warm-Up Boss</a>: Bria Tharen intends the Ylesian operation to be this. She argues for her and her troops to be sent in to liberate it, partly for ideological reasons and partly in the hopes of recruiting some of the pilgrims, but also because many of her troops are still inexperienced and need to test themselves in real combat before taking on an enemy as deadly as the Empire. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, Durga had already anticipated this and buffed up Ylesia's defenses by getting Xizor to send a private military firm to secure the place. The Rebels still win the battle, but it's bloodier than expected</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>: According to these novels, blasters have an Overload setting, which allows them to destroy vehicles, but carries the risk of the weapon exploding. The same setting also allows them to be used as grenades in a pinch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Jabba, and not just any child, but his infant <em>cousin</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Par for the course in <em>Star Wars</em>. The one we see the most is Nar Shaddaa, the "smugglers' moon" orbiting the homeworld of the Hutts, where Han and most of the other smugglers employed by them make their home. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged">Zigzagged</a> as although there's only one government official on the planet (he does basically nothing) nearly all of its inhabitants are criminals and the lawless areas definitely do exist, there's also plenty of people who live or work on the planet fairly comfortably. It likely helps that the crime is mostly <em>organized</em>, and they wouldn't tolerate too many street crimes cutting into their profits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">You Are Number 6</a>: All Pilgrims have their names replaced with numbers (Bria's is 921). She says it's because they give their names up to serve the One and the All wholly, but no doubt it helps break them down further so they can be fully taken in by the cult's indoctrination.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">You Killed My Father</a>: After he finds out that Jiliac is the one who had Aruk (his parent) killed, Durga challenges her to a duel. He manages to kill her, narrowly.</li></ul><hr>
