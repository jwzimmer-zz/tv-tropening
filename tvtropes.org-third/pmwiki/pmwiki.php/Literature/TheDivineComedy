This change may be the result of because the Latin Bible, which Dante would be familiar with, describing the noose as a "crux." While other parts of the text would make it clear to Latin readers Haman was hanged, this version of Haman's death would be immortalized by Michelangelo on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/SistineChapel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/SistineChapel">Sistine Chapel</a> ceiling, only a few feet away from <em>The Creation of Adam</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeAntechamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeAntechamber">Afterlife Antechamber</a>: The second part of the poem details Dante's journey through Purgatory.

This pre-Heavenly state is represented with a mountain, which is hardest to climb at the bottom and easiest to climb at the top.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a>: Despite being a traitor while he was alive, Ugolino's death is rendered as a tragedy.

In that penitentiary for the wrathful, darkness reflects judgement blinded by passion and emotion which the sinner must recognize and move away from before moving closer to the Lord.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation">Dead Person Conversation</a>: All over the place.

This is a fairly uncommon punishment in <em>Inferno</em>, and is shown directly only a couple of times; sinners are tormented by fire, ice, storms, hounds, snakes, <em>etc</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAChild">Death of a Child</a>:<ul><li> Dante first encounters a child in the afterlife is in the First Circle of Hell, where the poet briefly mentions seeing unbaptised infants among the virtuous pagans. By placing them in this First Circle, the poem affirms the necessity of baptism while maintaining that children are not tortured for remaining unbaptised by anything other than sadness and boredom.</li><li> In the penultimate canto, Bernard points out all the infants who died and went to Heaven by no merit other than their parent's faith, their circumcision, or their baptism.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation">Decapitation Presentation</a>: In the ditch of the Sowers of Discord, one of the damned holds 'his own head' up, "in the manner of a lantern," and speaks to the narrator's horror.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter">Decomposite Character</a>: Cacus is a flame-breathing giant from Greek mythology, which the poet seems to have found just too ludicrous to implement as such in his <em>Comedy</em>. To provide a more sensible character, Cacus is now a damned centaur who doesn't breath fire, because the little dragon who sits on his shoulder takes the role of fire-breather for him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyPainfulClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyPainfulClothing">Deliberately Painful Clothing</a>: The punishment for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrites</a> in <em>Inferno</em> is to wear gilded lead cloaks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>:<ul><li> The poem begins with its hero trying to climb out of a dark valley one last time, before a terrifying she-wolf causes him to abandon all hope of leaving and turning back into the sun-muted valley.

That angel busts into Hell, blasts open the demons' gate, and leaves. The angel was not referred to before and he failed to be referenced after, only serving to get Dante out of a bind and to demonstrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virgil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virgil">Virgil</a>'s inferiority to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the divine</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevilIsALoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevilIsALoser">The Devil Is a Loser</a>: Lucifer is a whiny giant, trapped waist-deep in a frozen lake, beating his massive wings trying to fly away from heaven, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell">and while doing so creating cold gusts of wind which freeze the ice back up, and push him up into the broken shards of ice</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Loser Indeed</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu">Did We Just Have Tea with Cthulhu?</a>: Two of the central themes of <em>Paradiso</em> are that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> is both endlessly unknowable and infinitely loving. Dante learns the even most powerful of the seraphim physically cannot understand all of the Divine Mind, but Dante grows to know that everyone in Heaven, from the oath-breakers to the Virgin Mother, all find happiness beyond expression in accepting the selfless love presented by God.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu">Did You Just Flip Off Cthulhu?</a>: Only eight circles into Hell does Dante find a sinner so stupid and sinister as to insult the God in control of his eternal torment. This is one of two times one of the damned directly mentions God, and this is the only time a damned dares to blaspheme. Yes, even those damned for blasphemy are sensible enough not to flip off the architect of their eternal grave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingToChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingToChina">Digging to China</a>: When the Devil got chucked out of Heaven into the center of the Earth, his evil so disturbed nature itself that all the rocks and minerals from Jerusalem to the other side of the world emptied out into the Southern Hemisphere. Conveniently, this created a tunnel from Jerusalem to its antipode, Purgatory, a 24-hour journey that takes up most of <em>Inferno</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>: The Opportunists, who aren't allowed into Hell, but are still punished for it anyway. Unlike the rest of the damned, Virgil refuses to acknowledge them and insists they get to the First Circle to talk to some sinners with backbone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">Dissonant Serenity</a>: Even as low as the second planet of Paradise, Beatrice's smile is so brilliant that the narration says a man would feel serenity looking at it even if he were in a fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookBack">Don't Look Back</a>: The angel who guards the gate to Purgatory warns that anyone who looks backwards towards the entrance to Purgatory will be banished from it. When Dante hears the gate shutting behind him, he finds he has no interest in looking behind him and so begins his climb to Paradise.<div class="indent"><em>"[I]f I&#146;d turned toward it, how could my fault have found a fit excuse?"</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning">Downer Beginning</a>: Dante starts off as a middle-aged man lost in the woods with no place in life, unable to get anywhere due to the heinous beasts who block his way. Metaphorically, the beasts represents the sins that plague our hero and the dark forest he's in is suspiciously similar to the forest where suicides spend eternity. It's a good thing Virgil comes in to bring Dante to a better place: Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>: No man can pass the she-wolf, a beast with every hunger whose mere sight can strike all hope from the heart. No one has ever gotten past her and she can corner men on their journey through life so that they will cower until their death. She will remain alive to haunt the world until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">the Greyhound</a> hunts her into Hell at the end of time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome">Dreaming of Things to Come</a>: The protagonist has three dreams to mark his progression through different parts of Purgatory.<ul><li> Before entering the first terrace, Dante falls asleep and dreams a terrifying eagle grabbed him and flew him into the burning sun. Dante awakens having felt real pain from the sun's heat, now right in front of the gate to Purgatory. It turns out Dante was dreaming of what he was doing while asleep and what he will do in the future: undergoing pain to ascend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the Eternal Light</a>.</li><li> Dante's second dream shows him in images the struggle of those who were greedy, gluttonous, or lustful. Dante dreams a meeting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">the Siren</a>. She seems beautiful and promises to satisfy all of Dante's desires, but that goes to Hell when a saintly lady appears. She alerts Dante's mentor to the siren and he tears her clothing off while keeping his eyes trained on the saintly lady. Without her clothing, the Siren can no longer hide her hideous stench, which immediately awakens Dante from his nightmare.</li><li> After climbing through all seven of the terraces, the poet has a vision of Leah and Rachel, the wives of Jacob from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a>. Leah is working to collect garlands while Rachel contemplates herself in the mirror, an action which earns not scorn but praise from Leah. Generally, this dream is taken as a sign of the peace between thought and action that comes upon the purgation of sins and unity with God.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbAndDrummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbAndDrummer">Dumb and Drummer</a>: <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Musical_imagery_in_the_Mastro_Adamo_epis.html?id=mZ6XAQAACAAJ">Best identified by Amilcare Iannucci.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The dull counterfeiter Master Adam may have a disproportioned body that looks like a lute, but when hit, his dropsies make the sound of a drum that expose his lower class, brutish nature, and idiocy to all fooled by his self-excusing lies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: Exceptionally for an epic, the <em>Comedy</em> ends happily with the protagonist having risen above the darkness of Earth, the torments of Hell, and the fires of Purgatory to fully encounter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. The last canto is taken up with Dante apologizing for his inability to describe how perfect the Love of God is and using every device he can to praise that One who is Three.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicEnvironment">Empathic Environment</a>: The light of Paradise's planets changes in regard to the collective joy of its inhabitants.<ul><li> Beatrice enters the kingdom of Mercury and is so happy that the entire planet grows brighter and "smiles," which pales in comparison to the change Beatrice's happiness brings to her living lover.</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a> Boniface VIII is discussed in Heaven, the sky turns dark and reddish, as if the whole cosmos is ashamed of how the true religion has been perverted.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge">End of an Age</a>: The decline of humanity is visualized in Inferno by a giant statue of crying old man. The tears are not water, but blood, and they don't come from the statue's eyes, but from its many cracks. Looking at the statue's golden head, you would hardly notice any tears, but as you look down, you would notice it getting more and more unstable as the statue went from silver, to bronze, to iron, and finally to baked clay. From the tears of this crumbling monument comes the four rivers of Hell which lead straight into the frozen lake which traps the traitors of God in the Earth's core.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnthrallingSiren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnthrallingSiren">Enthralling Siren</a>: There's a dream sequence centering around the siren just before the trip up Purgatory. She represents desire for things that are not ultimately satisfying.

He may represent Pluto though.

Just as betrayal is a calculating and cold evil, the damned here are submerged more and more into the ice depending on how calculated and unfeeling they were in carrying out their crime.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>: Despotic kings are so common in the world that Solomon is justly be said to be the wisest man alive for managing to maintain monarchy and morality in one man.

Sure, Dante's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavenAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavenAbove">Heaven is above the Earth</a>, but he doesn't describe it as with bunch of farts playing harps in the cloud, but as a realm where spirits use their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindMeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindMeld">Mind Meld</a> powers to form into giant sentient eagles and crosses everywhere from the Moon to the farthest stars of the universe all while having joy more intense than the heat of a lightning bolt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: The two women introduced at the top of Purgatory represent the opposing lifestyles of activity and contemplation.

Its a testament to Dante's writing that the poem is still suspenseful and shocking in moments despite the fact that it immediately spoils itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> At beginning of <em>Inferno</em>, Virgil tells the protagonist about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> came to Limbo and took many of the Jews up into Heaven, including Adam.

Needless to say, the last circle damns traitors to suffer in the bitterly frozen Lake of Cocytus.</li><li> One of the gluttons in Purgatory mentions his sister has ascended ahead of him into Heaven.

In his deep sympathy for his great-great-grandson, he allowed "his speech to descend to meet the limit of our intellect" and refrained from speaking truths beyond our comprehension.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a>: <em>Paradiso</em> breaks the fourth wall at one point to remind the reader that if the sun or the planets or even the stars were aligned slightly differently, every living being on Earth could be dead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a>: In her first appearance, the gardener of Eden is surrounded by friendly nature.

Pier uses his brief time to insist that he never committed treason or embezzlement and that he was only accused of such thing by those consumed by envy.</li><li> Brunetto Latini goes to the extreme of lecturing Dante on how he should live his life despite having suffered his way into the seventh circle. Turns out Latini is so single-mindedly focused on the need to live through the greatness of one's poetry that he can't notice his own fiery doom.</li><li> The giant Antaeus is quick to obey the whims of Dante as soon as the latter promises to bring the giant's name back to prominence on Earth, not even offering a comment or request regarding the chains and ice that confine him so tightly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>: In the thirty-third canto of the third part of the poem, the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumerologicalMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumerologicalMotif">100</a> lines is dedicated to describing Him, a task the narrator admits is like accurately recalling something you saw 25 centuries ago or speaking wisely with an infant's intellect. Still, the <em>Comedy</em> tries and ultimately illustrates a figure that is made up of three circles which somehow look as if they are a single circle. One of the circles looks like it's coming from the first circle and the third looks like fire being produced by both. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">That begotten circle</a> strangely has the same color as the rest of the circles while also bearing the hue of humanity, a fact which encapsulates the poem's protagonist. Although he tries to take the whole of that great light into his mind, Dante admits he is too weak for that, but the light granted him what his mind had asked for.<div class="indent"><em>"Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy: <br>But now was turning my desire and will, <br>Even as a wheel that equally is moved, <br>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">God in Human Form</a>: One thousand two hundred and seventy seven years before the poem began (by a demon's estimate), the Son of the Primal Power took on human nature so that man could be united to its Creator despite the evil of the First Man. This Man and God died as just vengeance against humanity for its sin, yet the injustice of the Divine Love being killed called wrath upon those wicked who did the deed. The evidence of this just and unjust vengeance dwells on Mars, where on a cross of martyrs lies the body of Christ with such splendor that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">memory and words cannot contain it</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood">God Is Good</a>: <em>Inferno</em> is such a terrible place because it is the furthest place in the universe from the Love, and when Dante jumps off the Devil's back to the surface, he begins an ascent through more beautiful and joyous areas of Purgatory and Paradise until he reaches what he calls "the Love that moves the Sun and the other stars", what we call God.

By founding the Franciscan Order and agreeing to be laid low, Francis avoided the arrogance of his wealthy compatriots and earned the praise of the choirs of Heaven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings">Good Wings, Evil Wings</a>: Satan's wings are directly compared to a bat's because they have no feathers, showing his corruption.

Probably the bloodiest is the punishment for the Sowers of Discord in the 9th Bolgia. Sinners there constantly walk in a circle, being hacked up by a demon and healing just in time to be mutilated again.<div class="indent"><em>"Between his legs were hanging down his entrails; His heart was visible, and the dismal sack That maketh excrement of what is eaten."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a>: Demons can kick a person's soul out of their body into Hell and then take the body as their own.

It's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> to go with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew">Gravity Screw</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a>: The second-lowest part of Purgatory is reserved for the envious like Sapia, who prayed for her enemies to be attacked and rejoiced when they lost everything and were chased from their homes. As penance, her eyes are blinded as she hears the cautionary tales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Cain</a> and Aglauros, both of whom were jealous of their siblings for their closeness to the divine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Green Thumb</a>: The Griffin causes the withering Tree of Life to fully blossom in a second with a touch of His chariot's pole.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>: In <em>Purgatorio</em>, Virgil admits he can't understand how the gaseous bodies of the dead are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">intangible</a> and susceptible to torments, so he hypothesizes God has hidden how this works from man and moves on from the topic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpingOnAboutHarpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpingOnAboutHarpies">Harping on About Harpies</a>: Harpies appear in the Forest of Suicides, wherein they tear off the branches of the tree people (which, as already mentioned, has the same effect as dismemberment) and use them to build nests in said tree people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurnedBackwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurnedBackwards">Head Turned Backwards</a>: In Hell, fortune-tellers have to walk forwards with their heads on backwards, unable to see what is ahead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">because of their forbidden attempts to see the future in life</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a>: Emphasizing her relationship with Christ and the Apostles, Beatrice heals Dante's newfound blindness with a touch of her hand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">Healing Shiv</a>: Virgil's speech is compared to the magical lance of Achilles, which could inflict a wound with a strike and heal the wound with a second strike. In applying this healing lance to Virgil, the severity of his criticism is emphasized while making it clear that the father-son relationship between Dante and Virgil suffered no lasting damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a>: The third part of the poem details Dante's journey through Heaven. Every soul in Heaven dwells outside the material universe in the presence of the Lord. However, Dante meets the souls of Heaven as he ascends through the nine spheres <em>before</em> the dwelling place of God. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerosMuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerosMuse">Hero's Muse</a> explains that this is only so Dante can better understand the internal difference between those who receive lesser graces in Heaven and those who receive greater graces. This inequality strikes Dante as unjust and he questions it frequently during the journey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavenAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavenAbove">Heaven Above</a>: The poem plays with the association of the sky and the realm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> by assigning each type of good person a planet, which would also be divine places under the trope's logic. The closer they are to Earth, the farther they are from God, who is portrayed as the ultimate sphere surrounding all the heavens and all the planets. So, yes, Dante says the sky is the divine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavensDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavensDevils">Heaven's Devils</a>: Virgil trusts the devils of fraud because his paganism has taught him that demons are agents of the gods' justice. The trope is subverted when the Malebranche try to kill Virgil and his ward after lying to them about how to leave their torture-chamber. It's so foolish to think Fallen Angels would act justly that even a damned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrite</a> mocks Virgil for his blunder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a>: The first part of the poem details Dante's journey through Hell. Each of the nine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CirclesOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CirclesOfHell">Circles of Hell</a> are entirely different with two exceptions: every Circle will be more painful after the Last Judgement and every Circle keeps the Damned exactly as they were in life. From that last part, Dante learns what it looks like to separate yourself from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> and how that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell">creates your own torture</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate">Hellgate</a>: Since Dante represents Hell with a physical Underworld, the entrance to the kingdom of the damned is a literal gate that includes an inscription written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the Author of Life</a> which includes a description of the depravity of Hell, a recitation of the virtues of the Author that are rejected by entry, and a famous command: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellhound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellhound">Hellhound</a>:<ul><li> Averted with Cerberus. Although he does have three heads, he is never actually referred to as being a dog, despite that depiction of him being well-known at the point <em>The Divine Comedy</em> was written. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DantesInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DantesInferno">The video game</a> picks up on this, showing the beast as all the more ugly and unrecognizable for being human-like.</li><li> The black bitches (as in female dogs) chasing and maiming the damned in the Forest of Suicides.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsWar">Hell Is War</a>: The fifth circle of Dante's <em>Inferno</em>: the Wrathful are made to fight in a stinking swamp surrounding the walls of Dis (the "capital city" of Hell, as it were, comprising Circles 6-9).

While calling it a happy place is a stretch, the people there aren't punished in any way other than missing out on Heaven, and the place is described as quite peaceful and beautiful. Also, the damned who inhabit the place are still mostly allowed to do what they were interested in in life. For instance, there are a fair amount of pagan philosophers there who can keep philosophizing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic">The Heretic</a>: These guys can be found in the sixth circle of Hell. Their punishment is to lie in flaming tombs. The ones we see are there because they were "Epicureans", however this does not mean they were all followers of Epicurus, it simply refers to those who did not believe in the immortality of the soul.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHermit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHermit">The Hermit</a>: The seventh sphere of Heaven (Saturn) houses those who left their worldly possessions to live a monastic life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>: All the brave who died in war or the good who martyred for the First Good live in the fifth sphere of Heaven, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mars">Mars</a>.

This makes the surrender of freedom back to God (especially in vows and oaths) a matter of incredible heroism and seriousness. The importance of vows is one of many indications that Piccarda is virtuous and pure, which adds more reason to question her low position in Heaven.<div class="indent"><em>"When the matter of a vow has so <br>much weight and worth that it tips every scale, <br>no other weight can serve as substitute."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerosMuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerosMuse">Hero's Muse</a>: Dante is sent on his quest for redemption through the afterlife by Beatrice, who enlists the help of the poet Virgil to guide him through Hell and Purgatory, and guides Dante through Heaven herself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus">Hijacked by Jesus</a>: Despite the generally Christian nature of this work, Dante borrows aspects of Hell (including the four rivers and various creatures) from the Greek underworld, and multiple sinners are prominent characters from Greek mythology.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter">Historical Domain Character</a>: Most of the characters with dialogue were contemporaries or relatives of Dante's, although there are a few significant characters from his history:<ul><li> The Roman poet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virgil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virgil">Virgil</a> serves as the guide through the afterlife in the first two parts of the <em>Comedy</em>.

From there, Statius repents of his ill-spending and begins his journey to join the Ultimate Good in Heaven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyBurnsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyBurnsEvil">Holy Burns Evil</a>: While going through Purgatory, the mere presence of an angel causes Dante to cringe and cover himself from the intensity of their light. Virgil makes it clear that this is only due to Dante's current imperfection and true to that, Dante's joy upon meeting the angels leads him to bathe in the light of their joyful fires. So, while Holy Burns Evil, it also Empowers Good.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeIsScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeIsScary">Hope Is Scary</a>: Master Adam, a counterfeiter infected with dropsy for infinite time, is tortured less by his extreme thirst than by his memory of the river Arno and luscious, well-hydrated fields that he knew in life. His ability to remember these great goods and his longing to return to them makes his actual torture all the more unbearable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a>:<ul><li> Knowing without a doubt that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood">Perfectly Good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient">All-Knowing</a> God had damned them, Dante still falls for the excuses of several characters being punished in Hell.<ul><li> First, he faints with despair after an adulterous couple explain why they had no choice but to fall into sin.

Dante thanks him for teaching him everything about writing and poetry and remembers how Latini taught him that the secret to immortality was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">write brilliantly</a>. Lattini reaffirms everything Dante says of him, even when Dante says he wouldn't have put Lattini in Hell, apparently not realizing that in life and now in death he lead Dante away from the true secret to immortality: giving one's self entirely in the Love that is God. So in perpetuating Dante's error and leading him away from the Paradise, Lattini continues in death to do Violence against God.</li></ul></li><li> Thomas Aquinas concludes a dialogue about human wisdom by observing that men are foolish when they casually judge whether another is damned or blessed, because to do so would be to "count ears before the corn is ripe." Since that's foolish, Aquinas reminds the ordinary man that he should not assume to be the Mind of the Lord, for even one who appears to be a robber can be saved while the charitable giver may suffer in Inferno.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>: One of the wrathful penitents in Purgatory says that Heaven is not to blame for evil in the world, but rather the free will man has abused. Unless a shepherd applies laws and guides humanity towards greater goods, the species is doomed to only greedily horde the most superfluous of goods and deny themselves true joy while tearing apart the world around them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">Humble Hero</a>: Purgatory's Terrace to purge pride is illustrated with three episodes depicting important people demonstrating humility.<ul><li> The mighty Emperor Trojan comes to the aid of an irrelevant widow, even though he had thousands of officers he could delegate this task to.</li><li> King David dances shamelessly in front of the Ark of the Covenant in praise of God, to the distaste of his vain wife.</li><li> The Virgin Mary is announced to be the Mother of Christ, which leads the immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Archangel Gabriel</a> to hail the young girl.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcarusAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcarusAllusion">Icarus Allusion</a>:<ul><li> When flying on a scorpion/dragon/demon monster made of lies down into the largest pit of soul-corpses, Dante was more afraid than Icarus was at the moment of his wings burning off.

Of course, Griffolino is using this reference to aggrandize himself for lying about being able to fly and getting burned at the stake for being unable to back his claims up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">An Ice Person</a>: The Devil is the originator of the unnatural coldness of the ninth and final circle of Hell.

To show how that phrase fails to capture Him, Dante will call him by unique titles like the Love that Moves the Sun and the Outer Stars, the First Equality, the Trinal Light, the Deep Mind, the Highest Joy, and more.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">I'm a Humanitarian</a>:<ul><li> Count Ugolino may have only eaten the corpses of his children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">out of desperation</a>, but once he reaches the bottom of Hell for treason, he has no reason to eat the head off his fellow damned other than pure hatred. This sickening "relationship" shows what humanity becomes the farther they are from God and foreshadows the monstrosity of Lucifer.</li><li> A canto after Dante talks to Ugolino, he finds Lucifer reduced to a monster who's only solace is in shredding Judas, Brutus, and Cassius apart with his three mouths. Unlike Ugolino, the Devil can't even talk and consumes the entirety of his victims instead of just their heads, showing that he is the "perfection" of the evil that was seen in the cannibal count.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">Infodump</a>:<ul><li> Dante and Virgil stop their descent through Hell in Canto 11 to get used to a new stench and, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Doylist</a> perspective, so that Virgil has time to explain the structure of Hell. Here, it's made clear that the reason lust, greed, gluttony, and anger are higher up in Hell is because the sinners who commit them are incontinent, or lack self-restraint. All the circles below the City of Dis punishes sins of malice because they involve a more deliberate and voluntary turn from the Highest Love. These crimes of malice include heresy, violence, fraud, and betrayal.</li><li> Nighttime falls just before Dante can enter the fourth terrace of Purgatory, forcing him and Virgil to pass the time by discussing the structure of Purgatory. In this dialogue between the seventeenth and eighteenth cantos, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a> are described as corrupt form of loves.

They also usually have more important places in Heaven or more picturesque punishments in Hell. There are some exceptions, though &mdash; the hoarders and spenders, for instance, are so featureless that they can barely be distinguished from each other, and Dante does pause to talk with a nameless Florentine suicide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">Intangibility</a>: Having left their bodies behind, all the deceased Dante meets on his journey are just shadows of their former selves that don't breathe, block light, or affect physical matter. This leads to a sad incident when Dante tries to hug his recently deceased friend, Casella, three different times only for his hands to pass through his friend's illusory back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence">Interplay of Sex and Violence</a>: Notably averted in the punishments of the lustful, the sodomites, and the pimps.

Dante says that the giants they met earlier (who were around 30 feet tall), were only about as big as big as one of his arms. Fortunately, he's basically harmless due to being trapped in the ice and nearly mindless, as Dante and Virgil are able to climb across his body without him reacting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">Kick the Son of a Bitch</a>: At one point while in Cocytus, Dante pulls a traitor's hair in order to force him to tell his story, going so far as to actually tear out handfuls of hair when the shade stubbornly refuses to say anything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a>: Dante speaks to his great-great-grandfather in the Mars sphere of Heaven.

What he means is that the saints living in Paradise are encased in light that gets progressively brighter the closer they are to God. By the time Dante has ascended the first three spheres of Heaven, the light of the blessed is too bright for Dante to recognize people he knew back on Earth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Light 'em Up</a>: Everyone who lives in Paradise can generate light relative to their proximity to God.

Her romantic language is so beautiful that Dante faints from distress, but every discussion of love outside of this sinner's excuses makes it clear that love is an intelligent will to do good for others, as opposed Francesca's view that love is really wanting to have sex.</li><li> Virgil explains in Purgatory that love can lead to evil only because love is the cause of every single human behavior. Lust, gluttony, and greed are caused by excessive love for physical pleasures, sloth is caused by love that is not acted upon, while wrath, envy, and pride are love for the suffering of others.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTranscendsSpacetime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTranscendsSpacetime">Love Transcends Spacetime</a>: The <em>Comedy</em> puts great emphasis on the Trinitarian belief that "God is love," meaning that time has been created by the perfect love between an inseparable Father and Son that they themselves live outside of time and space.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lunarians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lunarians">Lunarians</a>: The inhabitants of the Moon are ghosts so pale that Dante mistakes them for shadows and reflections, relegated to this lowest place in Paradise for the vows they've violated. In truth, they live with Mary, the angels, and the rest of the saved in God's Empyrean, but to allow Dante to understand the difference between them and other Paradisians, the oath-breakers have taken the pale Moon as their living place.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes M to R&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalMariee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalMariee">Mal Mari&eacute;e</a>: In the story of Paolo and Francesca in <em>Inferno</em> Canto 5, Francesca was wedded for political reason to Giovanni Malatesta (also called Gianciotto or "Giovanni the Lame"). While in Rimini, she fell in love with Giovanni's younger and handsome brother, Paolo, who was married as well.

After Virgil leaves Dante forever, Beatrice demands Dante repent of his sins until our hero is reduced to tears, prompting her to ask "What are you thinking," making it clear she is his new, and much more direct, mentor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa">Medusa</a>: Dante and his guide Virgil are initially barred from entering Lower Hell at the Gate of Dis in Circle Six. Those at the gate threaten to bring out Medusa to turn Dante to stone; Virgil, not trusting Dante to keep his own eyes closed, covers Dante's eyes with his own hands while they wait for divine aid to come to let them pass through.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype">Mentor Archetype</a>: Virgil guides Dante through Hell and Purgatory through his worldly wisdom. As a Roman poet, Virgil allegorically stands for wisdom obtainable by human reason, and he fittingly leaves the poem once Dante has to ascend to Heaven and face the world of theology.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard">Mentor Occupational Hazard</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>; Dante's mentor is the Hell-shadow of a pagan poet, so he can't die in the ordinary sense. Instead, the poet Virgil disappears without a word when Dante has scaled Purgatory and strengthened his will enough to be independent of his ghostly father figure. It is assumed Virgil returns to his eternal death in Hell, a fate which nearly moves Dante to tears.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>: Christ is represented at the end of <em>Purgatorio</em> by a mighty griffin. The griffin has two natures (lion and eagle) that mirror the two natures of Jesus (human and divine), it mightily denies to eat from the corrupting Tree of Knowledge, and the griffin guides a Sun-bright chariot that represents the Church. The griffin also is a mixture of three colors: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldAndWhiteAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldAndWhiteAreDivine">gold and white to highlight its divinity</a> and blood-red to make light of Christ's suffering in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionPlay">death</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">Metaphorically True</a>: One sinner asks Dante if he will clear the ice from his eyes after he tells his story.

Amazingly, not only can they perfectly move parts of the Eagle's bodies without speaking to each other, but the Eagle can talk separately from any of them. Spiritually, this shows the perfection of Heavenly communion, but it also makes a political point that kings are not supposed to manipulate others on whims, but are supposed to be one, subordinate part of a just society that works for the good of all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">Mix-and-Match Critters</a>: Geryon is described as a devil with the face of a honest man, the body of a multicolored serpent, hairy wings, and a scorpion's stinger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>: Betraying one's guests is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> &mdash; such sinners are <em>immediately</em> sent to Ptolomea even though they're still alive, with a demon inhabiting their body until their death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleHeadCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleHeadCase">Multiple Head Case</a>: In addition to Cerberus (who has three heads like in the original myths), Satan himself has three heads, meant to be the opposite of the Holy Trinity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMuse">The Muse</a>: Not only does Beatrice inspire Dante, but he invokes all 9 of them (plus Apollo!) to help write the epic the way it deserves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryTisOfTheeThatISting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryTisOfTheeThatISting">My Country Tis of Thee That I Sting</a>: Italians, especially those from Florence, populate Hell so completely that Dante manages to find five florentines immediately in the circle for Thieves.

This is hardly better than the Hell that rejects them, since the souls here are constantly attacked by wasps that cause their faces to stream with blood and Dante goes to note that these countless souls who chose to do nothing with life can hardly be said to have lived at all.

If you can jump into another circle or ditch of Hell, then the demons will be unable to follow since Divine Judgement confined them to their Circle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">No Party Like a Donner Party</a>: Ugolino, according to some interpretations, is implied to have eaten his children when imprisoned in the "Hunger Tower". In Hell, he continually eats the head of the man who imprisoned him there just like Tydeus did with an enemy soldier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThebaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThebaid">The Thebaid</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">No Sympathy</a>: Virgil appeals to the dead lover of Cato to convince the man to let Dante into Purgatory. Problem is, since Cato is in Purgatory while his lover is in Hell, Cato's unconditional love for his wife has turned to unmovable apathy, so Dante is only allowed to enter Purgatory due to the decree of God.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a>: Limbo is mostly populated by virtuous pagans who couldn't be baptized because they were born before the birth of Christ. So it's a pretty big deal that Saladin, a Muslim born several centuries after Christ, made it in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaAintLikeItUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaAintLikeItUsedToBe">Nostalgia Ain't Like It Used to Be</a>: In the fifth sphere of Heaven, Dante's great-great grandfather paints Dante a picture of a heroic, chaste, and Christian Florence from the time of the Second Crusade. This beautiful society Dante never got to know contrasts with the corrupt and sinful Florence that banished Dante in favor of a corrupt Pope, leaving Dante to imagine what his home could be if it only followed the example of its dead heroes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie">Not Afraid to Die</a>: The sight of the fiery wheels of souls rejoicing and dancing across the Sun proves more beautiful than anything found in life on Earth. Death, all the unpleasantries of it aside, is nothing to fear for a man like Dante who has seen such wonders on the other side.<div class="indent"><em>"Whoever weeps because on earth we die <br>that we may live on high, has never seen <br>eternal showers that bring refreshment there."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDrawnToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDrawnToScale">Not Drawn to Scale</a>: Dante provides some scattered measurements for places and things in Hell (such as the distance around one circle and the height of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">giant</a>); from these, one can attempt to infer the overall dimensions of Hell, but the results are wildly inconsistent. But considering that it's <em>Hell</em>, this may be explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath">The Nothing After Death</a>: Limbo, the first and outermost circle of Hell, is inhabited by virtuous heathens (it's not an oxymoron) and unbaptized children who died without knowledge of Christ. They do not suffer torments, but live forever without hope or the light of God. And while this might be a horrible fate, for people who exist there, like Socrates and other eminent pre-Christians, it's not necessarily painful. They essentially do there what they did in life: wax philosophic about everything without the distractions of sleep or sustenance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones">Nothing but Skin and Bones</a>: The gluttons in Purgatory are left so emaciated that Dante stares one right in the face and fails to recognize him until he hears his voice. It is only then that Dante realizes he is talking to the thinly-veiled skeleton of Forese Donati, his best friend since childhood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumerologicalMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumerologicalMotif">Numerological Motif</a>: <em>The Divine Comedy</em> as a whole is structured around the number 100. Each section has 33 cantos, with the exception of The Inferno, which has 34; the extra one serves as a general prologue for the entire poem.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker">The Oath-Breaker</a>: Saints who broke vows are relegated to the lowest sphere in Heaven, leaving the atomically charitable Sister Piccarda to live on the outskirts of Heaven only because she was forced into a marriage that lasted a day before she died of sickness. Dante's heavenly guide senses his discomfort with Piccarda's lesser place, so the guide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">explains the logic of the oath-breakers placement</a>. The guide makes it clear that in some way, however small, Piccarda did will to be a part of that marriage, and that there are many things she could have done to avoid breaking her vow that she did not take. Despite that, the Guide makes it clear that this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed Trope</a>, since the Oath-Breakers are still living in happiness for eternity in the same Perfect Love that Moses, the Virgin Mary, and the angels are receiving.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a>: The Malebranche is a group of pitch-black demons with bat's wings and names that all mean "evil." They gnash their teeth, curse, and eagerly prepare their pitchforks to stab people with, a get-up that telegraphs so much malice that even the hypocrites lower in Hell know not to trust them. Unfortunately, pagans like Virgil never got the memo and trust the Malebranche far too much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Offscreen Moment of Awesome</a>: Virgil often references the time when Christ broke into Hell, shook it to its foundations, and broke out the Jewish dead to take them to Paradise. It was so intense that even into the Eight Circle there's loads of structural damage, but Dante never describes it outside of proxies like Virgil and the rest of the damned.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWordTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWordTitle">One-Word Title</a>: Each of the three parts has a one-word title:<ul><li> <em>Inferno</em></li><li> <em>Purgatorio</em></li><li> <em>Paradiso</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyGoodPeopleMayPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyGoodPeopleMayPass">Only Good People May Pass</a>: While sinners are famously sent to the various circles of Hell depending on their greatest sin in life, the entrance to Hell (Limbo) is populated by "virtuous pagans": philosophers or good people in general but were unfortunately not baptized (being for the most part born before Christ). Among them, Dante put Homer, Orpheus, Plato and Saladin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery">Ontological Mystery</a>: The story begins with Dante lost in a dark forest with too little memory to explain how he got there beyond being extremely tired when he left the true path. He only escapes the forest thanks to the intercession of Beatrice, who reveals that Dante's deviations came as a result of seeking to replace his dead love with lesser, counterfeit goods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Our Angels Are Different</a>: In Dante's imaginations, angels take the shape of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> that carry wands, shine burning light, fly faster than any bird, guard Purgatory with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Swords</a>, and live in the "Primum Mobile," the last sphere of the universe beyond which there is only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the Deep Mind</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent">Our Centaurs Are Different</a>:<ul><li> Keeping with the classical myths, centaurs in Hell represent violence and wildness, which makes them perfect to further torment those damned for Violence against Others. They watch the boiling blood the damned lie and fire arrows at any who try to emerge from the blood.</li><li> In the sixth terrace of Purgatory, centaurs serve as examples for how monstrous gluttony can make one. Despite their divine ancestry as ones born of the clouds, the centaurs are made miserable and weak by their drunkenness, which ultimately leads to Theseus slaughtering them at the wedding of Pirithous.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Our Demons Are Different</a>: The word "demon" is mainly used to describe beasts and monsters who punished the damned in Hell rather than angels who are themselves punished there. So while Lucifer is never called a demon, Greek monsters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFerryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFerryman">Charon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellhound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellhound">Cerberus</a> alongside original creations like the winged Malebranche get the designation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Our Dragons Are Different</a>:<ul><li> The fire-breathing monster Cacus is rendered in Dante's imagination as a centaur with a small dragon on his shoulder who defends his host. Notably, Cacus and his dragon are both subject to the same punishment as human thieves, implying they have souls equivalent to that of a human's.</li><li> A dragon appears briefly near the end of <em>Purgatorio</em> to rise up from the ground and sting a chariot (representing the Church) with its venomous tail, which apparently is like the stinger of a wasp.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">Our Giants Are Bigger</a>: Between the circle of deception and betrayal, Hell is littered with giants who were so arrogant in their strength that they rose against the Heavens. This includes the Greek giants who fought to overthrow Zeus and Nimrod, the mighty warrior from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Genesis</a> who organized the Tower of Babel. Dante at first mistakes them for statues, which only tells you how huge the Devil is when Dante observes that he "matches better with a giant's breadth than giants match the measure of his arms."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent">Our Gryphons Are Different</a>: A gold and white griffin appears at the top of Purgatory as an allegory for Christ, who is both God and man like the griffin is both eagle and lion. In order to make this work with the doctrine that Christ is 100% divine and 100% human with no compromise, Dante perceives the griffin as both a complete eagle and a complete lion simultaneously, creating a very bizarre image that he struggles to convey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent">Our Spirits Are Different</a>: The souls of the dead here are referred to as "shades" because while they may appear to have bodies, they cannot touch physical people or project shadows. They really are entirely immaterial, but their souls are connected enough with their bodies to impress the air around the soul to take the appearance of a body, one which expresses the spiritual suffering the spirit undergoes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring">Outliving One's Offspring</a>: One of the last people Dante talks to in Hell goes into detail about how he and his sons were trapped in a tower until they starved to death. For his treason, his sons died over the course of days and he could do nothing but silently watch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>: St. Bernard is only introduced as the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a> with three chapters left to go, leaving him with only a few dozen lines compared to Beatrice's hundreds and the thousand-something Virgil gets. Even that reduced page-time is spent focusing on the universal motherhood of the Virgin Mary and the beauty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the Highest Joy</a> rather than Bernard's individual character. The degree to which the narrative and Bernard himself ignores him only tells us one thing about the man: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">that he has totally given his little life to God</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxymoronicBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxymoronicBeing">Oxymoronic Being</a>: Saint Bernard opens up the final canto of the <em>Comedy</em> by referring to Mary as the "Virgin Mother, daughter of your Son." The theological strangeness of Mary has never been so concisely put as in this opening prayer by her greatest devotee.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation">Painful Transformation</a>: Inferno XXIV gives a vivid account of thievish shades transforming into snakes and lizards, and vice versa. The transformation is treated like a rape, a topic so horrid Dante only explicitly mentions it in the context of Lucifer's rebellion against Heaven.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a>: The Virgin Mary saves the souls on Earth not by forcing them to be good, but by showing them her paradisiacal happiness and her mastery of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues">Seven Heavenly Virtues</a>. In this work, Mary is presented by art throughout Purgatory as the cure for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a> and Mary herself allows Dante to travel through Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise so he understand the importance of accepting the Father's love.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThePopcorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThePopcorn">Pass the Popcorn</a>: Dante gets so caught up listening to two sinners insulting each other that Virgil has to snap him out of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchworkMap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchworkMap">Patchwork Map</a>: Hell juxtaposes regions with wildly different climates, with everything from a desert pelted with fire-rain to an eternally frozen lake; justified in that it's a supernatural world shaped by divine will.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatronSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatronSaint">Patron Saint</a>: Dante is put on his journey through the afterlife by two female saints, the historical Lucia and Dante's idealized version of Beatrice, a frequent subject of his love poetry. Beatrice is more directly involved in Dante's journey when she sends Virgil to get Dante and then guides the poet by herself through Heaven, but she only intervenes at all because Saint Lucia informed her of how far Dante had strayed. Plus, Lucia at one point carries Dante through Purgatory to speed up his lengthy trek.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerformerKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerformerKing">The Performer King</a>: A singing picture in <em>Purgatorio</em> shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfKings">King David</a> dancing and singing in front of his subjects with no shame whatsoever. Such forward and honest expression is used as an example of humility to the calculating and glory-driven who are in Purgatory for sins of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a>: Jesus entered Hell once in the backstory, but that one visit caused that entire dimension to nearly collapse in a massive earthquake. Even a thousand years later, parts of Hell are still destroyed from the visit and travel between circles is significantly harder because of all the bridges that were destroyed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>:<ul><li> The Limbo is this when compared to the whole Hell. The souls that belong to this circle didn't commit sin but neither were baptized, thus aren't free from the original sin and are still condemned to eternal punishment... which consists of staying in a somber, foggy place where they can move and talk freely and don't suffer any pain except from being unable to participate in the Eternal Love.</li><li> Dante feels quite sad about Paolo and Francesca (a couple in the circle of the Lustful) as well.</li><li> Count Ugolino, a traitor in the depth of Hell, actually becomes pitiable when he tells his tale about his sons. Even more poignant if you consider that Dante's personal tragedy relates closely to Ugolino's because he was exiled from Florence with his (innocent) sons, as Ugolino was imprisoned with his. The fact that his family was condemned for his political choices weighted heavily on Dante's shoulders for all his later life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">The Philosopher</a>: A sphere in Heaven is dedicated to those who in life embodied wisdom and knowledge of that Deep Mind, including the likes of Thomas Aquinas, Saint Francis, Saint Dominic, and the many scholars and writers from the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a> up to 1300. A number of other pagan philosophers who were admired also have the nicest spot in the Inferno (as they cannot reach heaven without Christ, but were virtuous) such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a>. However, others such as Epicurus and his followers are eternally tormented (as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Epicureanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Epicureanism">their philosophy</a> denied there was an afterlife) in the first circle, for the heretics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">Phony Psychic</a>: All supposedly psychic people are condemned to the fourth bolgia in Malebolge, the circle of fraud, which suggests Dante thought all psychics are phony.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed Trope</a>; Beatrice explains that the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> describes God as if he had hands and the angels as if they had eyes since humans can only understand things from the senses, so even non-physical existence must be described with sensory details.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a>: The seven planets medievals thought orbited the Earth, which include the Moon and the Sun, are fully inhabited by saints of similar natures. The trope is justified, as Beatrice goes out of her way to make it clear that the saints are on the same planet because they are similar, and not vice versa.<ul><li> The Moon is the planet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathbreaker">The Oathbreakers</a> who didn't absolutely will to break their oaths.</li><li> Mercury is the planet of those too driven by fame and honor on Earth.</li><li> Venus is the planet of those too focused on romantic pursuits.</li><li> The Sun is the planet of wise men.</li><li> Mars is the planet of the holy warriors.</li><li> Jupiter is the planet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good Kings</a>.</li><li> Saturn is the planet of the contemplatives.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPerson">Plant Person</a>: Those who commit suicide are reduced to bleeding trees, since it would be unjust for those who threw away their bodies to be given them back in the afterlife.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicCave">Platonic Cave</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted Trope</a>; the souls of the Moon are so pearly and faint that Dante mistakes these real people for shadow. Beatrice has to show the child-like Dante that he faces no illusions, but true reality.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero">Politically Incorrect Hero</a>: Virgil is constantly praised in the poem and he is the one who directly leads Dante on the path to Heaven, but he also is a pagan from Hell who never accepted Christ as all decent people were expected to in medieval Italian society. It can be easy to forget Virgil's paganism, but Dante notices it and is embarrassed when the mentor he loves talks about how he helped a pagan necromancer bring some souls out of Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Politically Incorrect Villain</a>: Most of the souls in Hell at least have enough decency not to curse God or anything well-respected in medieval society, but a particularly vile thief that Dante encounters explicitly curses God and gives him a rude gesture equivalent to a middle finger. This demonstrates the defining trait of the lowest parts of Hell, the use of a unique human gift like communication for evil.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>:<ul><li> The concept of circles of Hell and the quote "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" (or a close variant) are well-known and alluded to/copied in innumerable places, but their origin isn't as widely known. (However, in pop culture, they are usually seen with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Fire and Brimstone Hell</a>, instead of the more varied and complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a> of the Inferno.)</li><li> In Italy, many quotes from Hell have become proverbial. It's also worth nothing that about 15% of the most-used words in the modern Italian language were first used in literature by Dante in the Comedy. This is because the Comedy is one of the first works to be written in Italian, rather than Latin.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostVictoryCollapse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostVictoryCollapse">Post-Victory Collapse</a>: After pushing through the firewall at the end of Purgatory, the protagonist is so exhausted that he walks a few steps and falls asleep on a stair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>: Those damned for heresy are gifted with vision of Earth's future. The catch is that they can't <em>not</em> see the future so they have no idea what has happened or is happening on Earth. When the Apocalypse comes and all souls enter Heaven or Hell, the heretics (and possibly everyone in Hell) will have knowledge of nothing but their torment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>:<ul><li> Despite every assurance of Virgil, Dante is wholly unwilling to go through the final firewall between Purgatory and Heaven until he hears Beatrice's name. By virtue of that romantic love, Dante summons the courage to go through a fire more intense than anything on Earth to find Beatrice on the other side.</li><li> The last verse of <em>Paradiso</em> and the <em>Comedy</em> as a whole describes God as "the love that moves the Sun and the other stars."

Since the answer is "no treasure," Dante happily requests the deceased Pope stay in the fires of Hell to make sure his ill-gotten money is well-protected, as befitting one who is the ideal evangelist for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">the red dragon of Hell</a> and the worshipper of hundreds of gods of silver and treasure. Whether out of anger and despair, the speech causes the damned Pope to struggle more violently from within his pit, but Dante claims that he would condemn his greed even further if not for Dante's respect for the office the damned held in life.

Although he's rather weak and pitiful, despite being the largest creature Dante's ever seen. He's stuck in a torturously cold put of ice that's being sustained from a cold wind created by his own wings, which he flaps desperately in his attempts at escape. He doesn't even put up a fight when Dante and Virgil climb down his body, since he's too preoccupied crying in pain and chewing apart the bodies of Judas, Brutus, and Cassius with the three heads he has to mock the Trinity. Even his wings are ugly and molten, looking more like bat wings than the majestic span one would expect from the greatest of angels.<div class="indent"><em>"Were he as fair, as he now is foul, and lifted up his brow against the Maker, well may proceed from him all tribulation."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves">Savage Wolves</a>:<ul><li> A fearsome, ravenous she-wolf, that represents Dante's sin of Greed, instills enough fear in Dante that he gives up on climbing the mountain.</li><li> Greed is described as a wolf in <em>Purgatorio</em>, one with endless hunger, more prey than any other beast, and free reign over Earth until Christ's return.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a>: Dante repeats the name of Virgil three times in three lines when he turns back and sees his foster-father is gone.

For example, as Dante enters the first sphere of Heaven with the beatified soul of his deceased lover, Dante realizes the sphere is on the Moon and he theorizes why the Moon has black spots (that we now know to be craters) on it. Beatrice criticizes his points on "rarity and density" of matter and proves his theory to be invalid.

In the prior example, Beatrice uses the dispute to reveal to Dante how the Moon, the stars, and anything made of matter relies on the will of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the Deep Mind</a> to continue to exist at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScyllaAndCharybdis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScyllaAndCharybdis">Scylla and Charybdis</a>: The narrator begins <em>Paradiso</em> Canto 4 with four hypothetical situations where two equal desires force inaction. The relevance is that Dante isn't sure whether to ask his Heavenly guide about how Piccarda could justly be put lower in Heaven for actions done against her will or to ask the guide about if the souls he met on the Moon really reside their after death. Thankfully, his guide is astute enough to read his face and satisfies both desires with her answer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a>:<ul><li> Several times in <em>Purgatorio</em>, Dante meets someone and tries to show off some of his poetry, but Virgil rushes them along, saying his poetry doesn't matter.</li><li> While Dante expects a tender and loving reunion with Beatrice, she angrily lambasts him and tears him apart, calling all of heaven to bear witness to the fact that Dante doesn't love her like he thinks he does.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell">Self-Inflicted Hell</a>:<ul><li> The damned are implied to have chosen their own fate, as they clamber madly to cross the river Acheron.</li><li> Lucifer's massive wings create the cold wind that keeps the lake Cocytus frozen, sustaining the ice trapping him in Hell and creating the very cold that tortures him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsertFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsertFic">Self-Insert Fic</a>: The main protagonist of the poem, Dante, is a fictionalized version of the author who interacts with many characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>.

The protagonist passes through the first two but cannot pass the she-wolf.</li><li> Purgatory is a mountain divided into seven terraces where people atone for each of the Deadly Sins. The one at the bottom is the one Dante considered the worst of them, and the sins become less grave as one ascends the mountain.<ul><li> Pride: The first terrace has the prideful carry rocks up the mountain, forcing them to lower themselves and see the Earth for what it is rather than what their ego imagines.</li><li> Envy: The second terrace has angels who sew shut the eyes of the envious so they may not look upon others and their possessions.

She often knows what Dante wants to ask before he does and she always has an answer that leaves him stunned and better for it.</li><li> Saint Bernard takes over as Dante's guides for the last two cantos so that Bernard, on the advice of the Blessed Mother, can help Dante better perceive and experience the true presence of God.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarsAreSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarsAreSouls">Stars Are Souls</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted Trope</a>; upon ascending into Heaven, it seems as if every human soul ascends to a different Heavenly body, whether it be a star or one of the planets. Our hero finds it odd that somehow the pagan philosophers were right about this, but God's messenger, Beatrice, explains that the souls only appear on different stars and planets to help our hero understand the distinctions between types of saints.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>: The punishment in Hell for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">flatterers</a> is to be trapped in a ditch filled with fecal matter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the ditch is full of shit, just they they are.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>:<ul><li> The heretic Farinata stands upright and composed in the middle of his flaming tomb, expressing more disdain than horrific suffering. The closest he gets to emotion is when he hears that his descendants have all been defeated and exiled from the city he died for, a fate he previously admitted would be more torturous for him than Hell itself. In response to this great misfortune, he sighs and shakes his head.</li><li> Dante sees the Greek hero Jason being punished in the eighth circle of Hell.

Their sin is considered two-fold, and so is their punishment; For committing violence against themselves, they have their bodies entombed in oak trees or strewn across thorny bushes and are feasted upon by demonic harpies, and for rejecting God's love, they will be the only sinners denied the chance to regain their human forms come the Day of Judgement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">Super Empowering</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">Exaggerated Trope</a>; God provides every power that exists to everything that has every had those powers, most fundamentally in providing the power to exist at all to beings.

The heretic catches on to the "did" and asks if his son is alive. The protagonist hesitates, giving the heretic enough information to fall on his back and never speak again. The protagonist later makes it clear the son's still alive and the heretic just read too much into a moment's silence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil">Swamps Are Evil</a>: In the fifth circle of Hell, Dante describes the Styx as a foul swamp where the wrathful constantly tear each other apart and the sullen lay gurgling under the surface.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicBaptism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicBaptism">Symbolic Baptism</a>:<ul><li> At the foot of Mount Purgatory, Dante bathes himself in the water of Lethe, the Greek river believed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">erase memories</a>, to wash away the grime of Hell. Without that stain, Dante can start to ascend towards the heavens.</li><li> At the peak of Mount Purgatory, Dante is again bathed in the water of Lethe, apparently not having fully let go of his memory of evil. After this, Dante is bathed in the waters of Eunoe to prepare himself to enter Heaven, but <em>Purgatorio</em> has to skip over this event to fit into the poem's rigid structure.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicMutilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicMutilation">Symbolic Mutilation</a>: In his curious attempts to see Saint John's body, Dante is blinded by the light of John's immaterial soul. It is only when Dante restates his sole devotion to God and confesses that all other good fruits come from that Everlasting Gardener, prompting Beatrice to restore Dante's sight in order to allow him to see the true humanity in Adam.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticAdulterer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticAdulterer">Sympathetic Adulterer</a>: Francesca plays the Pay Cheating Unto Arranged Marriage card to make herself and Paolo seem sympathetic.

Virgil sometimes tells Dante off for this. After all, if an omniscient and all-loving God has decided they're unworthy of pity, why should anyone go against divine will and feel sorry for them?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a>: The Furies on the walls of Dis threaten to call forth Medusa to turn Dante to stone, but Virgil shields him with his cloak.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">Take Our Word for It</a>:<ul><li> At the end of <em>Inferno</em>, Dante pleads with his reader not to ask him to describe how he felt in the cold of the bottom of Hell. The most he can say is that he wasn't alive and he wasn't dead.</li><li> At the end of <em>Paradiso</em>, Dante prefaces his description of God by comparing his memory to the passion one feels after a dream they can't quite remember and admits he is so inadequate at describing the glory of "the Eternal Light" into words that he might as well have the tongue of an infant.<div class="indent"><em>Shorter henceforward will my language fall <br> Of what I yet remember, than an infant's <br>Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</em></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>:<ul><li> Dante's personal and political enemies, as well as historical villains &mdash; even some of his <em>friends</em> &mdash; often end up in Hell. One of the most notable examples is none other than the then-current <em>Pope</em>, Boniface VIII, of whom Dante was not a big fan. This was a big "screw you" to Boniface and the town of Florence for exiling him (in an order that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dantes-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html">wasn't repealed until 2008<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).

Sure, Saladin is in the circle for the Virtuous, but it implies that Muslims are really pagans and Dante takes special attention to point out Saladin is alone. The greatest insult to Muslims comes in Circle 8, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad">The Prophet Muhammad</a> and one of the Muslim Caliphs, Ali, are seen in the Circle of Hell reserved for schismatics, cut in half, a reference to how they supposedly divided Christendom.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">A Taste of the Lash</a>: The punishment for the seducers and pamperers (pimps) damned in the first ring of the eighth Circle of Hell is to be forced to march around said ring while being constantly whipped by demons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>: Among Dante's three guides, Beatrice is the one who Dante is most dependent on emotionally and intellectually.

In Dante's own (heavily translated and context-extracted) words, Beatrice "read me as I read myself."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryBlindness">Temporary Blindness</a>: Dante loses his sight for some time after his reunion with Beatrice.

To further show his humanity in the face of his fantastic travels, Dante faints, weeps, kicks the heads of incapacitated shades, and lambastes in the narration things his character self almost immediately does.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardians">Threshold Guardians</a>: Before Dante can ascend above the universe and see God, he has to prove the truth of his virtues to three of Christ's apostles. Faith and hope are easy enough, but Saint John's test of love blinds Dante and puts terror in him until he confesses that the goodness of every leaf in creation gives him reason to love their Eternal Gardener.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>: Twice for the work as a whole, both in <em>Inferno</em>:<ul><li> Canto 16 ends with the narrator swearing by "my Comedy" that he tells the truth when he says that he saw the monster Geryon emerge from a waterfall.</li><li> Canto 21 opens with the narrator mentioning that Dante and Virgil were discussing "things my Comedy is not concerned to sing," oddly dropping the title when talking about something explicitly irrelevant to the work.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToHellAndBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToHellAndBack">To Hell and Back</a>:<ul><li> Unable to move past the beasts of the world and climb closer to Love itself, Dante has the spirit of Virgil sent to him to guide him through Hell, so he may witness and understand the fullness of sin. Upon reaching the narrowest, coldest pit of Inferno, Dante and his guide climb atop the back of Satan and jump down into the core of the Earth, only to find themselves rising up onto the other side and reaching the first step of Mount Purgatory, beginning Dante's ascent to God.</li><li> Several other infernonauts are mentioned as predecessors of Dante. He himself makes a point that he has none of the virtues that got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid">Aeneas</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ActsOfTheApostles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ActsOfTheApostles">St. Paul</a> through the fires and later the Furies employ measures on the Italian that they boast would have stopped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Theseus</a>' incursion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">Toilet Humour</a>:<ul><li> One of the Malebranche "makes a trumpet of his ass" as a salute to his fellow demons.</li><li> The flatterers in the second Bolgia are immersed in shit.</li><li> Mohammed's torso is split in half and his stomach drops out.

The other incarnate humans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his Blessed Mother, only appear in three cantos of the hundred, each time with no dialogue and little physical description outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">the narrator's laments at how indescribable their glory is.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove">Tough Love</a>: The audience is made to expect Lady Beatrice to be graceful and lovely as any pure damsel could be, only for her to express her love to Dante by drilling him on his sins until he bursts into tears. The angels pity the poet, but Beatrice remains stern as an admiral while maintaining only tears can allow Dante to survive the entry into Paradise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror">Transformation Horror</a>: Damned thieves are turned into snakes and have to regain human form by attacking others and eating their essences. The poet gives a vivid description of how each part of the human body devolves into the form of a serpent while the serpent painfully splits apart into a man. Another thief gets <em>fused</em> with a lizard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationRay">Transformation Ray</a>: If you add eagle wings to a griffin's chariot, the chariot will grow seven heads, ten horns, a giant, and a whore. Well, that's what we learn about <em>Purgatorio</em> 32, which is more concerned with visualizing the corruption power brought into the one true Church.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Treachery Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>: The Ninth and lowest Circle of Hell is a vast frozen lake in which traitors are entombed. In the center of it all is Lucifer himself, trapped up to his waist, his wings beating in a futile attempt to free himself that only creates winds freezing him. Within his mouths, the three ultimate traitors (Brutus, Cassius, and Judas Iscariot) are ground to scraps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTreacheryOfImages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTreacheryOfImages">The Treachery of Images</a>: The narrator spends much of <em>Paradiso</em> lamenting that even his most extensive and beautiful descriptions of Heaven are mere shadows of his memories, which themselves are shadows of the real experience. The inequality between reality, memory, and expression become a topic of discussion between Dante and his blessed great-great-grandfather, who experiences all these equally.<div class="indent"><em>"In mortals, word and sentiment [...] are wings whose featherings are disparate."</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse">Trojan Horse</a>: Three different people are damned to the Eighth Circle for creating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> Trojan Horse. Ulysses/Odysseus and Diomedes burn with the false counselors in the Circle's eighth ditch for their fraud to the Trojans while Sinon suffers from excruciating disease at the very last ditch of deceit for his falsification of words.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadBarefooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadBarefooter">Undead Barefooter</a>: The illustrators (including Gustave Dore) usually depict all the deceased characters (including Virgil) barefoot; Dante wearing shoes literally symbolizes that he's the only living person there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">Understatement</a>: Dante's friend, Forese, agrees to name his neighbors in Purgatory by saying "It isn't forbidden," a sardonic response in light of the fact that they are all so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones">emaciated and hollow</a> that names are necessary to distinguish them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a>: Those who betray their lords are in the lowest circle of hell, completely encased in the frozen lake and contorted horribly.

Both Dante and Casella fail to realize this until the third time they pass through each other, one of many blows to Dante's pride.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a>:<ul><li> In the fourth circle of Hell (where those who hoarded and wasted their wealth are punished), Dante and Virgil meet Plutus, the Roman god of wealth, who is heard muttering random gibberish to himself.</li><li> Like in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a>, those who built the Tower of Babel are punished for their prideful attempt to unite to surpass God by having new languages imposed on them to divide them. The only exception is Nimrod, who retains his original language, leaving him unable to communicate and relate with others due to betraying his most essential relationship with God. His fate foreshadows the madness and isolation of the leader of Hell, Satan.</li><li> The Devil, despite having three mouths, has lost all reason to communicate with others. Now, his mouths are only used to rip his fellow damned apart like meat grinders, corrupting his ability to love and connect with others as a tool to destroy and shred.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">Unreliable Expositor</a>: Every one of the damned in <em>Inferno</em> tries to avoid admitting their faults in life and try to convince Dante (and through him, the reader) to see them as unwilling victims of love, glory, God, or whatever scapegoat that's most plausible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">Unusually Uninteresting Sight</a>: Farinata, a heretic who believed the soul died with the body, seems to find everything uninteresting, even the eternal pain he suffers. At most he expresses mildly annoyance by the flaming tomb of spikes he rests in and when his conversation is interrupted by a father who realizes his son is dead, he doesn't move his face an inch until the father shuts up and then Farinata continues as if nothing had happened.<div class="indent"><em>"[T]hat great-hearted one, the other shade <br>at whose request I'd stayed, did not change aspect <br>or turn aside his head or lean or bend; <br>and taking up his words where-he'd left off..."</em></div><ul><li> In Hell there are some figures from Greek Mythology, as well as some completely fictional characters, who are down there right alongside real people who actually existed. None of the damned seem to think meeting mythical/fictional characters as if they were real people is the least bit odd (granted, they <em>are</em> in Hell, but it's still pretty weird.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing">Vagueness Is Coming</a>: The souls of the dead often warn Dante that his native city is only going to get worse and worse and that his own fate will be shaped by the sins of Florence. These prophecies refer to Dante's real life exile from Florence four years after the <em>Comedy</em> is set.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity">Vice City</a>: In contrast to the peaceful castle of Limbo, the last four circles of Hell are contained beyond the city of Dis. Guarded by harpies, within the walls of the cities are graves of fire, literal blood baths, the forest of suicides, and a desert where fire rains. Past that, there's a deep drop into the Malebolge (Evil Ditch) that leads even further down into Cocytus, a frozen lake made from all the evil rivers of Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousGlutton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousGlutton">Villainous Glutton</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">None of those damned for gluttony are fat or seen grossly overeating</a>; instead, the image of a man with a man with food overflowing from his mouth continuing to fill his sack with food is used to describe the ever-growing corruption and envy of the author's hometown of Florence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousHarlequin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousHarlequin">Villainous Harlequin</a>: One of the ten named demons from the fifth <em>bolgia</em> is known as Alichino, a name derived from the Italian for "harlequin." He is the only one whose blood-lust so overcomes his sense that he trusts a damned politician who promises to deliver more souls to kill; naturally, the politician betrays Alichino and leaves him looking like quite the fool.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie">Villains Never Lie</a>: It's understandable wanting directions on your trek through the burning tar pits of the Malebolge, but Virgil would have been wiser to buy a map rather than seeking guidance from the local devils who run said burning tar pits of etc. etc. Naturally, those devils deliberately send Virgil down a dead end, try to attack him, and send him tumbling into the next Circle of Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater">Walk on Water</a>: In a show of divinely-gifted power, the first angel to appear walks across a river of fire to help Dante on his odyssey through Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virgil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virgil">Virgil</a> introduces himself to Dante not as a man, but as a shadow of one, making it clear that the damned who will be encountered in <em>Inferno</em> are less than people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>: Dante writes himself into the story as an observer unfamiliar with the reality of the afterlives, putting him in the position to ask theological and moral questions that Virgil or Beatrice can answer. He also fits the trope by being the narrator of the story who is largely secondary to the plot, since Dante can only get through Hell due to the holy protection of Beatrice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a>: A devil mentioned in <em>Purgatorio</em> Canto 5 naturally has the power to send vapor flying into the sky and cause a heavy rainfall, a blessing he abuses to wash away the body of a man who repented of evil with his last breath.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessSearchAndRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessSearchAndRescue">Weirdness Search and Rescue</a>: The living poet Dante is given through the fires of Hell and Purgatory to report on what he sees there, and is given the soul of Roman poet Virgil (a man who was in hell because he had the misfortune to live and die before the mission of Christ) as his tour guide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> After literally going through Hell with Dante, Virgil vanishes without saying good-bye at the top of Purgatory. We already knew he wouldn't be taking Dante through Heaven, but it remains unclear how he's going to get back to the First Circle of Hell from the opposite side of the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThebaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThebaid">Statius</a> is released from Purgatory as Dante passes through, so he joins Dante on his ascent to Heaven. Problem is, the last place Statius appears is at the top of Purgatory, so the reader is left to assume that Statius makes it to Paradise and to speculate where in Paradise he eternally resides.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Inferno</em> Canto 5, the protagonist lets the sweat words and ode to love of a damned adulteress to stir his sympathy not even two circles into Hell. Virgil is shocked and asks the hero what he's thinking shortly before he faints from disproportionate sympathy.</li><li> After going through Hell and climbing up a mountain of trials to meet his long-dead lover, our great hero is met with a stern, distant woman who reminds Dante that he forgot her after his death, chased women who lacked any of her goodness, and set himself on a self-destructive path in life despite all the good she did for him. She refuses to show him any kindness and reminds him of his failures until the mighty hero of the <em>Comedy</em> bursts into tears.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">Wise Beyond Their Years</a>: Saint Dominic is described as loving Christ even in his infancy, shocking his nurse with his deep expressions of contemplation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfInSheepsClothing">Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</a>: Geryon, the creature who flies Dante into the Eighth Circle, is the biologically manifestation of fraud. It may have the face of a beautiful man, but behind that face is the body of a massive winged serpent with a tail ripe with venom.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Women Are Wiser</a>: The three most venerated and holy characters (outside of God himself) are the Virgin Mary, Saint Lucia, and Beatrice. These three women orchestrate and allow Dante's descent through the afterlives even though him and Virgil frequently fail and need to divine intervention to get through. Not only does Saint Lucia at one point need to carry Dante up Purgatory, but Beatrice spends nearly every canto of <em>Paradiso</em> admonishing Dante's flawed conceptions of God and correcting him with the help of the other saints.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>: Ghost-kicking, Hell-strutting Virgil fails horribly to protect Dante from the demons of Dis, creating real suspense that they'll make Dante stay in Hell forever. When all seems lost, the thousand demons scramble way in fear at the sight of an angel who knocks down all their defenses with a light push, strictly establishing that the powers of Heaven are unrivaled by anything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsSmartestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsSmartestMan">World's Smartest Man</a>: St. Thomas goes through introducing every spirit on the Sun without problem until he identifies Solomon as the wisest man to live on Earth. Thomas reads Dante's mind (through God's) and agrees that the unfallen men, Adam and Jesus, would be wiser by account of having the love of the Trinity more perfectly infused in them. The distinction Thomas makes is that no man was smart <em>as king</em> than Solomon, since only he was smart enough that no knowledge of geometric logic, military formation, or even angelic power could be more of a blessing than knowing how God wanted him to rule the people of Israel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkInfoTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkInfoTitle">Work Info Title</a>: <em>The Divine</em> <em><strong>Comedy</strong></em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Saladin, the Muslim opponent of Richard the Lionhearted during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a>, is in the circle with virtuous pagans rather than further down among heretics, probably because of this trope.</li><li> Farinata degli Uberti (<em>Inferno</em> Canto X) counts too. He was a Florentine past political leader, and one of the most prominent members of the Ghibellini (the faction which sided with the Emperor as opposed to the Guelfi, which sided with the pope) and he and Dante's ancestors were enemies. From their meeting in hell, it is clear that Dante admires the man, even as he acknowledges their rivalry and differing viewpoints.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleWarcry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleWarcry">Wounded Gazelle Warcry</a>: Helen of Troy is in Hell because she got herself kidnapped by the Trojan prince on purpose in order to give her own nation an excuse to invade Troy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames">Wreathed in Flames</a>: The saints from Mars on are wreathed in holy spirit-flame that makes them resemble shooting stars as they burn with Christ's Love.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: The lower circles of Hell gradually become less individual and more of a connected society of back-stabbing, lying, and eternally self-destructive shadows of what were men.<ul><li> The corrupt politicians send secret signals to tell the others that the demons hunting them are elsewhere, a fact we only learn because one of the politicians offers this information to the demons in exchange for safety.</li><li> The thieves know each other names, form in groups, and refer to each other as comrades, until one of gets turned into a snake. At that point, the still-sentient thief will seek out their friends and attack them, returning to their normal form while reducing their supposed comrade to a snake. The cycle repeats forever.</li><li> Dante can't even talk to the inhabitants of the tenth <em>bolgia</em>, designated for pure falsifiers, because they're too busy running from, fighting with, or screaming at each other. The poem's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype">Mentor Archetype</a> has to order Dante to leave, lest the infernal society take some hold in his mind.</li><li> The core of Hell is occupied by Satan, whose giant mouths make him most qualified to communicate. But by his sin, his faculty to communicate has been turned only to destroy others, and so Satan's mouths serve as meatgrinders reducing Judas and two other traitors to blood.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell">You Are Worth Hell</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed Trope</a> in <em>Inferno</em>, in which souls damned for lust are bound forever to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>, yet this only adds to their torment by serving as a perpetual reminder of their sins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">You Cannot Grasp the True Form</a>: Insofar as God is depicted at all, His depiction is in an extremely abstract fashion due to how far he is beyond human understanding. Dante has to literally go through Hell, climb up the opposite side of the world, fly outside the universe, bathe his eyes in a river of heavenly light, and pray for the intercession of the Mother of God and even then, he admits his memory provides an infinitely inadequate account of what He actually is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>: The corruption of Dante's hometown, Florence, and his impending exile from it haunts the <em>Comedy</em> through the uncountable damned Florentines and the reminders by the saints of how great Florence used to be. Dante's pain over the loss of his city's greatness and his future loss of it entirely stings the poet until he realizes Paradise, not Florence, is his true home.</li></ul></div><hr>
