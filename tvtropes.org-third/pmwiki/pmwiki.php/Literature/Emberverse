Meanwhile, in Corvallis, the Oregon State University "faculty senate" rallies the city survivors to their banner, while Juniper Mackenzie and her neo-pagan "Georgian Wiccan" coven form the "Clan Mackenzie" in the hills south of Lebanon, Oregon. Finally, history professor Norman Arminger rallies the members of his local branch of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SocietyForCreativeAnachronism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SocietyForCreativeAnachronism">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> and the criminal element of Portland to his "Portland Protective Association", based on a feudalistic monarchy with some minor Mordorian influences.

This marks the start of the Protector's War</li><li> <em>A Meeting at Corvallis</em> (2006): The Protector's War ends, and peace finally comes to the Willamette Valley...for a time.</li></ul><p>The second trilogy takes place 22 years after the Change, after a 12-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>:</p><ul><li> <em>The Sunrise Lands</em> (2007): Ingolf Vogeler, a traveler from Readstown, Wisconsin, arrives at Dun Juniper, the capital of the Clan Mackenzie, searching for a man known as "The Son of the Bear Who Rules," so the Wisconsinite can take him to obtain "The Sword of the Lady," after a vision he received while visiting the island of Nantucket. He is pursued by assassins from the Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT), a religious cult who view the Change as punishment from God. Rudi Mackenzie, son of Juniper Mackenzie and Mike Havel, long ago prophesied as "The Lady's Sword" at his naming ceremony, leads Ingolf, Mathilda Arminger (his childhood friend and heiress to the PPA throne), her vassal Odard Liu, Rudi's sisters Mary and Ritva (both D&uacute;nedain Rangers), and Father Ignatius (a warrior-monk of the Benedictine order of Mount Angel). Together they embark on a cross-country quest to recover "The Sword of the Lady," which waits for Rudi back at Nantucket.</li><li> <em>The Scourge of God</em> (2008): The CUT gains in power, land and influence, apparently aided by otherworldly forces, threatening the entirety of the Willamette Valley and all of what used to be the United States. Meanwhile, Rudi and company make their way across the Midwest, and arrive at the Provisional Republic Of Iowa.</li><li> <em>The Sword of the Lady</em> (2009): Rudi and his companions finally arrive at Nantucket, and obtain the titular sword, as the war between the CUT and the Willamette forces takes a turn for the worse.</li></ul><p>The next series, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">tetrology</a>, tracks Rudi and co.'s journey back to the Willamette to complete their quest, then wraps up the war with the CUT.</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>The High King of Montival</em> (2010): Now in possession of the Sword, Rudi - Artos - must journey back to the western lands he'd left behind, and muster from them an army to rescue his homeland. Both he and his people back home work to consolidate the newborn kingdom, should they prevail against the Cutters.</li><li> <em>The Tears of the Sun</em> (2011): The kingdom of Montival takes firmer shape under Artos's leadership, the disparate groups within drawing together to meet the CUT threat. Allies from the eastern lands, as well as from the former Canada, provide vital support. Part of the war effort includes sowing dissension in the enemy ranks, with the goal of taking the CUT's ally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Boise</span> out of the war.</li><li> <em>Lord of Mountains</em> (September 2012): The combined armies of Montival and its allies, led by Rudi with the Sword, take on the CUT invasion, and do their best to reduce the CUT influence in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Boise</span>. (The death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Martin Thurston</span> is a significant step toward that end, but more remains to be done.) After a climactic battle in the Horse Heaven Hills, the leaders of Montival decide on a further course of action and formally unify under Rudi's leadership.</li><li> <em>The Given Sacrifice</em> (September 2013): The war against the CUT concludes and a new generation comes of age. Rudi's final fate is shown when he intervenes in a conflict between Haida raiders and a party from Japan.</li></ul><p>The final series, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">pentalogy</a>, takes place a generation afterwards, and includes:</p><ul><li> <em>The Golden Princess</em> (2014): Rudi's Mackenzie's heir, Orlaith, meets up with Nipponese princess Reiko and her band, who are fleeing the evil CUT-like force which has taken over much of Asia. As Rudi did a generation before, Reiko seeks a sacred sword which may give her and her people a chance of victory over their life-hating enemy. Orlaith, her faithful knight Heuradys d'Ath, and other children of the last tetrology's heroes join Reiko in her quest.</li><li> <em>The Desert and the Blade</em> (2015): As they travel further into California (now called Westria), Crown Princess Orlaith and Prince John must elude the pursuing troops of their mother, even as they confront evil forces backed by those who seek to thwart Reiko's quest. Some faces and places from the <em>The Change</em> anthology make an appearance.</li><li> <em>Prince of Outcasts</em> (2016): A mystically-generated storm sweeps John's ship across the Pacific, to the island chains of the Ceram Sea. With new allies at his side, he finds himself fighting against new and unexpected foes both from Earthly realms, and others. Meanwhile, in Montival, a new alliance prepares to take on the enemies of the Nipponese.</li><li> <em>The Sea Peoples</em> (2017): John's spirit has fallen captive to the powers of the Yellow Raja and his servant, the Pallid Mask. His motley band of friends and followers quest through realms of dark and shadow to save him from a fate worse than death. Meanwhile, Orlaith and Reiko muster their kingdoms for war, but more than weapons or even the dark magic of the sorcerers of Pyongyang threatens them.</li><li> <em>The Sky-Blue Wolves</em> (2018): With her fire-forged friend and ally, Japanese Empress Reiko, &Oacute;rlaith must take up her sword to stop the spread of the mad malignancy behind the Yellow Raja, who has imprisoned her brother Prince John. And from the emerging superpower of Mongolia, the Sky-Blue Wolves of the High Steppe ride once more beneath the banner of Genghis Khan&mdash;the thunder of their hooves resounding across a world in turmoil.</li></ul><p>A shared-world anthology set in the Emberverse, titled <em>The Change</em>, was released in 2015. S.M.

Estella Maldonado (who makes her final appearance in <em>Lord of Mountains</em>) was not developed as well as the series' other gay characters; most (but not all) of the time when she was shown it was in a purely professional context.
