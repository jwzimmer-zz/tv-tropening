Orphaned at five due to an earthquake, she is taken in by a group of Neanderthals. Auel goes into great detail on the physiology of these Neanderthals, who call themselves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Clan of the Cave Bear</a> after their primary deity. The main difference between Clan and "Others" (Cro-Magnons) is that Clan have access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a>, which makes them quick studies for anything their species already knows but very slow to accept innovation or change. Ayla is adopted by the clan's medicine woman, and her brother, a crippled shaman, learning a great deal of herb lore and practical medicine, but also learns to hunt in direct defiance of the Clan's traditions. Her clan's leader (the brother of the medicine woman and shaman both) accepts her as best he can, able to recognize her talents and skills even if they make him uncomfortable, but when his snotty son takes up the mantle of leadership, the son has Ayla exiled from the Clan. This would be easier on 14-year-old Ayla if she hadn't borne a son, Durc, a <em>Homo neanderthalensis x sapiens</em> hybrid that must be left behind.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>From this point on, Ayla strikes out on her own, seeking her own kind. The story then begins to alternate between her point of view and that of her designated love interest, Jondalar, a Cro-Magnon from what is today France, as he journeys down the length of the "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube">Great Mother River<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" with his brother Thonolan. Thonolan is killed during the adventure, and Jondalar wounded, but Ayla saves him, and the two fall in love. After spending a year with a Ukrainian tribe and entering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, they then begin to journey back up the Danube, arriving back at Jondalar's homeland just in time for the fifth book to start.</p><p><span class="asscaps">The novels in the series:</span></p><ul><li> <em>The Clan of the Cave Bear</em> (1980), which follows Ayla's life with the Clan from her adoption (age 5) to ostracism (age 14).</li><li> <em>The Valley of Horses</em> (1982), in which Ayla lives a solitary existence in the titular location while Jondalar travels to meet her.

Ayla learns a lot about living with her own species; Jondalar learns how much he loves her when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> is introduced.</li><li> <em>The Plains of Passage</em> (1990): Jondalar and Ayla travel west along the Great Mother River, encountering various characters and peoples Jondalar had met on the way down, and some other surprises as well.</li><li> <em>The Shelters of Stone</em> (2002): Jondalar and Ayla finally arrive home, where Ayla begins to integrate herself among his people (the "Zelandonii").</li><li> <em>The Land of Painted Caves</em> (2011): Ayla continues her training to become a Zelandoni (priestess/medicine woman) for her tribe.</li></ul><p>Auel is considered something of an expert on Ice-Age culture, due to the sheer amount of research (and hands-on experience) she has with the practices at hand, such as leather-tanning, flint-knapping and cave paintings. She has attempted to weave into the story as much archaeology from the period as possible, often depicting the creation of known prehistoric artifacts. Recurring themes include the differences between Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon intelligence, sapience and physiology, and the racial tensions resulting thereof, as well as Ayla's upbringing in the Clan and the prejudice she is subjected to for that reason.</p><p>It has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/EarthsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/EarthsChildren">character page</a>.</p><p>The first book, <em>The Clan of the Cave Bear</em>, was adapted into a film in 1986 of the same name starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarylHannah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarylHannah">Daryl Hannah</a> as Ayla.

Part of Creb's backstory involves him having been badly mauled by a cave bear as a young boy and two men are injured by the cave bear at the Clan Gathering, one of them fatally. However, cave bears are sacred to the Clan and being attacked by one is considered an honour; if you survive, you get to claim the Cave Bear as your totem, as well as continuing to claim the totem you were assigned as a baby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSingingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSingingVoice">Beautiful Singing Voice</a>: The One Who Is First To Serve The Great Earth Mother (she has no other name) is considered the First in part because of her beautiful singing voice, which helps her to communicate with the spirit world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty Equals Goodness</a>: Ayla, and Jondalar as well, who is described as being not only handsome but intensely charismatic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">Beauty Is Bad</a>: The attractive but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> character of Attaroa and to a lesser extent with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> Marona.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a>: In <em>The Valley of Horses</em>, Thonolan and Jetamio.

But staring at other people's private conversations is considered to be bad manners, especially if that conversation is taking place at another family's hearth, and Creb eventually has to tell Ayla to stop. Though Ayla isn't actually punished for her transgression, she is bewildered by Creb's behaviour towards her, partly because she was unaware that she was doing anything wrong, but mostly because he has never scolded her before.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed">Bigger Is Better in Bed</a>: Deconstructed and reconstructed. Jondalar is so well-endowed that he has had to hold back with all but a few partners he's ever had... except Ayla, whose painful past experience has given her sufficient "character depth" to love all of him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: <em>The Mammoth Hunters</em>. Although Ayla and Jondalar happily reconcile, both learn important lessons and are beginning their journey to Jondalar's homeland to begin a new life, they still have to part with all the friends they made with the Mamutoi. It's especially hard on Ayla, as she had come to view many of them as a family <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and had even been adopted by Mamut</span> and it's very unlikely they'll ever see any of them again. Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> poor little Rydag</span> has died and Ayla also has the unpleasant task of breaking up with Ranec, who is utterly heartbroken. The novel actually <em>ends</em> with him watching Ayla and Jondalar leaving, silently weeping while clutching the carving he'd made for her. Yeesh.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism">Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism</a>: Clan men are larger and stronger than Clan women, but what makes them bizarre is that nearly <em>every</em> possible skill is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility">Gender-Restricted Ability</a>. There's very little both sexes are capable of learning.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor">Bluff the Impostor</a>: Suspicious Mamutoi try this on Ayla at one point in <em>The Plains of Passage</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">Boldly Coming</a>: Jondalar and Thonolan when they meet a new tribe.

And lion. And wolf. Between leaving the Clan and meeting Jondalar, a period of about three years, the <em>only</em> relationships Ayla has in <em>The Valley of Horses</em> are with the animals she tames there. It's made quite clear that having them to look after and to keep her company are a big reason she didn't go completely mad from loneliness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyMeetsGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyMeetsGirl">Boy Meets Girl</a>: A main plot in the second and third books is Ayla and Jondalar meeting by fate (or one hell of a coincidence), falling in love, breaking up due to various misunderstandings and then realising how much they care for each other (especially after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience">Near-Death Experience</a>) and getting back together.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterTeam">Brother&#150;Sister Team</a>: Leadership among the Mamutoi is shown to work along these lines; the headman and woman of a given camp will be brother and sister rather than a married couple.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">Cannot Tell a Lie</a>: Literally for all of the Clan. Their use of sign language means that nobody can tell a lie, as their body language would give it away. Ayla adheres to this even when she learns to speak in Cro-Magnon language. The books repeatedly state that the closest the Clan gets to lying is omitting information. Ayla attempts the latter unsuccessfully in the first book when she is being interrogated about how she learned to hunt: when asked when she started to learn, she simply says she was there and happened to watch. It is only under direct questioning by Broud and Brun that she is forced to answer that she saw Broud being embarrassed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a>: Brug in the film.

However, Ayla (herself the mother of such a child) speculates that Rydag may be a rare exception since his mother, though initially wary of the members of Lion Camp, did not show the levels of fear which Clan women usually show around the Others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildOfTwoWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildOfTwoWorlds">Child of Two Worlds</a>: Ayla literally dreams that her son Durc (half Clan, half Cro-Magnon) brings the two disparate communities together, but it never happens as far as we know. In the meantime she herself, a Cro-Mag raised in the Clan, is is the catalyst for the two tribes learning to have not <em>quite</em> so terrible feelings towards one another.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">Christmas Cake</a>: Ayla, 19 years old when finally married, thinks of herself as one.

It can also be seen as a Coming of Age Story for Jondalar, who grows as a person and learns some hard lessons over the course of the novels too (though for some readers, it&#146;s <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

This helps give a sense of place and enhances the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CradleOfLoneliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CradleOfLoneliness">Cradle of Loneliness</a>: Ayla does this <em>Valley of the Horses</em>.

Specifically, there was no evidence that they had a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone#Function">hyoid bone<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Recent excavations have debunked this, as a hyoid bone has been found in Neanderthal remains.</li><li> Neanderthals are portrayed as almost universally dark-haired while Cro-Magnons show all the phenotypes found in modern (mostly European) humans. Recent studies in neanderthal mDNA have shown that at least some of them were red-haired. Additionally, its likely that the Cro-Magnons would have been fairly dark skinned, since they'd have recently (from an evolutionary perspective) immigrated out of Africa.</li><li> The technology and cultures of the Others are a mixture of several different distinct Late Pleistocene material cultures, now known to have been separated by multi-millennial gaps in time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Dead Guy Junior</a>: Or, in this case, Dead Girl Junior.

Sex is talked about openly with children and no one minds if they witness sexual acts &mdash; some kids are even known to mimic sexual acts during play in imitation of their parents. Girls are expected to go through First Rites, where they are ritually deflowered by an experienced older man, as soon as they hit menarche, meaning most girls having First Rites are between 12 and 16. Boys are assigned to a donii-woman to teach them about sex when they hit puberty, so they are generally around the same age as girls. It's also not considered that strange for people to be married with kids by their late teens. This is partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as real hunter-gatherer cultures where people live in close proximity are often more open about sex.</li><li> The Clan also have no taboos about public sex. Girls can be regarded as women as soon as they menstruate and married off as young as eight, though in this case, Clan girls actually reach physical maturity earlier than Cro-Magnon, so it's not quite as Squicky. Of course, the Clan also raise girls to be submissive to men and always do as they say. This includes 'presenting' themselves for sexual intercourse whenever a man gives them the signal and men being allowed to physically punish women for being disobedient, though the Clan draw the line at using excessive violence or beating women for no reason. Women can also be executed for using weapons and must isolate themselves when they get their periods and for a time after they give birth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">Does Not Like Men</a>: Attaroa, a villain from the fourth book, who was apparently married to a half-Clan husband.

Though it&#146;s not really discussed that often, when Attaroa tries to force <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jondalar</span> to have sex with her in exchange for his freedom, which she has done with several other men in the past, it&#146;s clearly presented as wrong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jondalar</span> is disgusted and refuses, stating that it is a perversion of the &#145;Gift of Pleasure&#146; and that it is supposed to be done between willing partners. There was also an instance where a group of women all but swamped Jondalar, who became uncomfortable and pushed one woman away when she wouldn&#146;t let go of him. He apologizes for hurting her, but when the woman tries complaining to Shamud, they point out that men don&#146;t like being forcibly groped and that Pleasures should never be forced on anyone. It&#146;s probably safe to say from these instances that any &#145;perversion of the Mother&#146;s gift&#146; is unacceptable, although rape of women by men is especially reviled.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning">Downer Beginning</a>: <em>The Valley of Horses</em> for Ayla.

He's so angered by this he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">tries to hit her</a> (she ducks) and thus breaks the taboo about acknowledging cursed people. When he tries to deflect the bad luck onto Brun (who had subtly acknowledged Ayla) he just turns it right back on Broud, pointing out he just proved Ayla's point and publicly humiliating him by stating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">how ashamed of him he is</a> and that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyAreYouNotMySon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyAreYouNotMySon">wishes Ayla had been his son</a> because she will always be the better person; this leaves Broud deeply shaken and somewhat undermines his perceived 'victory'</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramatisPersonae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramatisPersonae">Dramatis Personae</a>: Some of the books include a list of all the characters that appear in that book, including what cave/camp they belong to, their titles and who they're related to.

The women are supposed to be the rulers &mdash; except talking to men isn't allowed (let alone physical intimacy with your former husband), giving birth to a boy is punishable by death, and the boys themselves are subjected to horrific fates. Attaroa's also incompetent, so they're nearly out of food. Really, the whole thing is just a show for Attaroa's sadistic megalomania. Though they try to pretend they're happy (complaining and disobedience are punished by hurting one's male relatives), many women get sick of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthquakesCauseFissures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthquakesCauseFissures">Earthquakes Cause Fissures</a>: At the start of the first book, with Ayla's biological family apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">falling into one</a>, leaving her orphaned and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">kickstarting the entire series</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEpic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEpic">The Epic</a>: Certainly has the trappings of one, being set in primordial Europe (specifically the last Ice Age) and focusing upon the life and adventures of one woman from the age of five to around twenty-six (her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Jondalar gets a fair amount of page-time too, but we're with Ayla right from the beginning).

Consequently, both the Others and the Clan have fairly lax sexual norms. A certain amount of partner-rotation is permissible among the Others, and before you get married you get to play the field. In the Clan there is a hand-sign, that can only be made by men, which indicates the man wants to "relieve his needs" and the woman should drop whatever she's doing and immediately present for intercourse. It is implied that the women can find this just as enjoyable as the men do. The Clan women have found herbal versions of hormonal contraceptives, but usually do not prescribe them unless a woman might die if she gets pregnant again. While it's considered unlucky for an unmated woman to give birth and they will try to pair her off beforehand, only two characters are known to have connected sex with reproduction so far, one of them being Ayla.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHasLotsOfSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHasLotsOfSex">Everybody Has Lots of Sex</a>: As one of the themes of the series seems to be refuting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil">Sex Is Evil</a> trope, the author describes sex between Ayla and Jondalar (and a few other people) with lots of detail.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyWantsTheHermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyWantsTheHermaphrodite">Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite</a>: Transgender people (not that they're called that) are socially expected to become mamuti (medicine people), since they're already marked as "special" by the Great Earth Mother.

With more informal greetings, they'll usually just state their name and tribe. Ayla in particular has a very long list of ties since she's a Zelandonii, a Mamutoi, a Clan medicine woman, has the Cave Lion as her totem, and is friend to three horses and a wolf. Then she mates Jondalar and gets to add all <em>his</em> extensive family ties to her own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>: Race relations and racism are a major theme of the series. The Others call the Clan "flatheads" and claim they're animals related to bears, but despise them as unclean monsters in a stark departure from their attitudes towards actual animals (a hypocrisy Ayla points out to them).

This is explained as a trade-off that evolved along with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a>, but it makes them unable to survive alone even briefly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a>: The Clan have this, mostly in an unconscious form.

This is because her mate is apparently half Clan, and they have larger skulls. Joplaya refuses, as she'd been trying for some time to have children with no success, and in the end safely gives birth. However, she does agree to use contraception to prevent future pregnancies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex">Good People Have Good Sex</a>: Played straight with Ayla and Jondalar (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasLotsOfSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasLotsOfSex">almost every other protagonist</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a>: Marona is excruciatingly jealous of Ayla for having Jondalar's love. Much earlier in the saga, Broud deeply resents the attention Ayla draws, though among the Clan that's never sexual attraction (by their standards she's butt ugly). Bodoa apparently felt this way after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Joconan married Marthona instead of her</span>. And Jondalar is <em>crazy</em> green-eyed over any guy who flirts with Ayla &mdash; much to her distress.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a>: Any of the half-Clan/half-Other characters who have cropped up in the past, such as Durc, Rydag, and Echozar; there's even a three-fourths-human character, Brukeval (or at least it's hypothesized he is). Of course, the whole point of the race-relations depicted in the series is that Neanderthals <em>are</em> human, so the trope name doesn't really fit (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/science/07neanderthal.html?pagewanted=1&amp;src=mv">Auel seems to have gotten their existence at least partially right<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).

He's even sickly (a weak heart), but after Ayla teaches him the Clan's sign language, the rest of Lion Camp learn it to varying degrees so that they can communicate with him. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he dies of heart failure</span> toward the end of <em>The Mammoth Hunters</em>, most of the Lion Camp are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> devastated (and even some readers get a little teary-eyed.)</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinousHyena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinousHyena">Heinous Hyena</a>: Ayla has a strong aversion to hyenas, ever since a hyena grabbed a baby during a mammoth hunt.

Because the female is considered to be filling a religious role, such relationships are expected to stay platonic... but Jondalar fell in love with his donii-woman and she with him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Another man, who desired said woman, spied on them planning to marry and publicized the whole thing.

And yes, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoitusEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoitusEnsues">sexy times</a> in the hot springs, although there's also a subplot where Ayla and Losaduna (the local shaman) utilize a sacred hot spring in a special ritual, to help a girl come to terms with a personal trauma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowlOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowlOfSorrow">Howl of Sorrow</a>: Wolf (a tame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">wolf</a>) howls during the funeral of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rydag.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse">Hufflepuff House</a>: The Aterian, Hadumai and Sungaea tribes. Jondalar and Thonolan meet the Hadumai while on their Journey, staying with them just long enough for Jondalar to take part in a young woman's Rites of First Pleasures, which may have left her pregnant with his child; other than this, they are largely irrelevant to the storyline. The Sungaea are neighbours of the Mamutoi, but only appear directly when the members of Lion Camp visit a Sungaea camp where two young siblings have recently died. And the Aterians never appear at all, though it is mentioned that Ranec's mother came from that tribe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWhite">Humans Are White</a>: The story takes place entirely in Europe, and the characters generally have modern European coloration. Two exceptions:<ul><li> Ranec, who is half-black. His father walked from (modern-day) Ukraine to northern Africa (yes, <em>walked</em>) before meeting his black mother's people. However, Ranec gets around sexually (like most men in this story), and many characters have observed his genetic influence on the younger generation, so a darker skin tone is present among some of the Mamutoi children whom he fathered.</li><li> In <em>The Plains of Passage</em>, we are introduced to Jerika (East Asian), the second wife to Jondalar's (European) father Dalanar, and their daughter Joplaya, and Jerika's father Hochaman.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotPretty">I Am Not Pretty</a>: Ayla continues to view herself by the Clan standards with which she was raised, according to which she's too tall, unfeminine, and <em>very</em> ugly. Everyone around her was a Neanderthal, so that's the appearance she's used to. By European <em>Homo sapiens</em> standards she's actually beautiful, but she can't wrap her head around that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcyBlueEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcyBlueEyes">Icy Blue Eyes</a>: Jondalar's blue eyes are an intense glacier blue described as "magnetic" and "charismatic" and capable of seducing any woman he uses them on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealizedSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealizedSex">Idealized Sex</a>: Some of the sex scenes are this, but others are, surprisingly, aversions. The first time Ayla and Jondalar get it on, she has no idea what to do because she&#146;s never had sex before and actually makes commentary on the foreplay, to Jondalar's amusement. Another time, she and Jondalar have trouble getting her dress undone and Jondalar bangs his nose on her amulet; they also get interrupted by Wolf on a few occasions. It&#146;s mentioned that Ayla always cleans herself after sex, with Jondalar eventually copying her, as this is what Iza taught her to do. The risk of pregnancy never really comes up because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissConception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissConception">people don&#146;t realize sex is linked to conception</a>, although when Ayla figures it out, she makes sure to take a contraceptive tea to avoid pregnancy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod">Jondalar</a>'s also been taught how to pleasure his sexual partners (and has had a <em>lot</em> of practice) to make sure their experience is a good one, so this may partly justify the more idealized sex scenes. It does get a bit ridiculous, though, when Jondalar and Ayla can just throw themselves on the ground and immediately go at it with no foreplay, and yet Ayla's perfectly fine, claiming that her deep love for Jondalar means she's <em>always</em> "ready" for him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IkeaErotica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IkeaErotica">Ikea Erotica</a>: The series (with the exception of the first book) has pages and pages of this stuff (all the sex scenes average at least six pages each) largely devoted to the fact that Ayla and Jondalar have genitals of a complementary size, and are in fact, the only people with genitals of such a size. Also, they sometimes like to watch horses do it, or mammoths.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality">Infant Immortality</a>:<ul><li> Played straight with the five-year-old Ayla, who somehow manages to survive alone for an unspecified number of days despite having no knowledge of how to fend for herself other than making sure to stay near water in order to avoid dehydration. She does come close to dying from the combined effects of starvation and blood poisoning (caused by the infected cave lion scratches on her leg) but Iza finds her in time and nurses her back to health.</li><li> However, the series also contains a few aversions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rydag</span>, for example, is around six or seven years old when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dies from his congenital heart defect</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">Info Dump</a>:<ul><li> Increasingly as the series progresses. Auel rhapsodizes about the locales she sets the action in, as well as the ways her characters, as allegories for the areas' real ancient inhabitants, lived off the land and adapted to their environment. The flora and fauna are also described in detail, as well as their uses in both medicine and as food, to the point where readers of George Martin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> series might wonder if he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowtheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowtheLeader">takes cues from her about how to describe a meal</a>. But her acknowledgments had to be moved from the beginning of her books to the end because they got exponentially lengthy, and the research she did has often been cited as one of the main reasons for the ever-expanding delay between sequels. Ultimately, her painstaking devotion to including as much of her research as possible in the story has become something of a detraction from the later novels, especially <em>Land of Painted Caves</em>, with readers complaining that her focus on the backdrop has caused the advancement of the plot and development of her characters to suffer.</li><li> She also does this a lot when it comes to retelling aspects of the story that has come before. Granted that by the time she got to <em>Shelters of Stone</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">there was a lot of material to remember</a>, but Auel would often rehash the same things more than once within the space of a few <em>pages</em>, both in a character's thoughts and in conversations that seem to just cover the same ground over and over and <em>over</em>. One wonders if she wasn't sure people would remember what they'd read before.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IThoughtEveryoneCouldDoThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IThoughtEveryoneCouldDoThat">I Thought Everyone Could Do That</a>: Ayla's "powers", her innovations and self-taught skills, are often like this. Somewhat justified, as her "inventions" probably aren't entirely hers. This is really WMG, but at least some of the things that just suddenly occur to her seem to be intended as clues to her past, memories of what she saw in her birth tribe. By the age of five, one observes and stores away quite a bit. When she finds the people who already have the things she's "invented," she will know she's closer to home. The fact that Ayla is repeatedly described as "exotic" is another clue that her tribe is elsewhere. Of course, by the end of book 4, she's about a continent away from where the Clan found her. And the author seems to have given up entirely on solving either Ayla's background or what became of her son by series' end.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>:<ul><li> Broud is a sadistic, arrogant, out-of-control, all around unbearable character. He doesn't like Ayla from the beginning for being different, and being adopted into his family. After she was permitted to hunt, something women are not ordinarily allowed, he comes to hate her. Upon growing up, he begins raping her, with Ayla forced to submit as a result of their Clan's custom. By the end of the first book, even his father almost disowns him. He doesn't though-as a result, he's made the leader by inheritance, and promptly has Ayla banished.</li><li> Frebec of the Mamutoi Lion Camp is not a nice person &mdash; he's neglectful to his mate, bickers constantly with his mother-in-law, riles up everyone else and is very judgmental of Ayla and Rydag, but it's implied that a lot of this stems from feelings of inferiority, he genuinely loves Fralie and he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> by the end of the book</span>.</li><li> Laramar, a loutish Zelandonii man who does nothing but drink the alcohol he brews, neglects his kids and eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> disowns them</span>.</li><li> Brukeval, a short-fused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">Boomerang Bigot</a> with a rather creepy love-hate obsession with Ayla, though he's almost certainly in <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

However, it's usually only when he's under a great deal of stress and he's mostly a decent guy. He also regrets and tries to amends for his Jerkass behavior.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunglePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunglePrincess">Jungle Princess</a>: Ayla qualifies, especially if you believe the Clan are animals (many Others do). Jondalar has to teach her to speak verbally. In fact she insists on being taught since she knows the Others speak and she's planning to look for tribes of Others to live with. When she finds out he taught her his own language and the closest Others speak differently, she makes him teach her <em>that</em> language too.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropes K - N&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>:<ul><li> In the first book, Ayla's birth family, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Iza</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Creb</span>.</li><li> In the second book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jetamio</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thonolan</span>.</li><li> In the third book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rydag</span>.</li><li> In the fourth book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Attaroa</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shamud</span>, though the latter's death is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash">off-screen</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a>: What Attaroa creates on the assumption that, if no men are present, all babies will be born female. (The Others believe that The Great Earth Mother decides when each child is conceived, and chooses the "spirit" of a nearby person to kindle in the mother's womb. If no men are available, only women's spirits will be chosen, yes? Meanwhile, Ayla notices that the only babies conceived during Attaroa's reign are to women who sneak out to the men...) It's as if Attaroa designed a (sadistic) experiment for Ayla to test her fatherhood hypothesis.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfTruth">Language of Truth</a>: Because the Clan speak in a mostly-silent sign language that incorporates body language, it is impossible for a person of the Clan (or Ayla) to lie, or be lied to: they always know you're withholding something. "Refraining from mentioning" is, however, allowed for the sake of privacy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">Law of Inverse Fertility</a>:<ul><li> Jetamio and Thonolan struggle to conceive, with Jetamio suffering several miscarriages. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She eventually carries a pregnancy to term, but both she and the baby die in childbirth</span>.</li><li> In <em>The Land of Painted Caves</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ayla</span> finds out she&#146;s pregnant again and is excited, hoping it will be a boy this time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(she and Jondalar already have a daughter)</span>.

Nevertheless, it has Ayla display intermittent clairvoyance and precognition, and Creb is so revered because <em>he's</em> got psychic powers as well; in one scene, he gives other Neanderthal men a sacred drink, then guides their thoughts back to the earliest Neanderthal ancestor and then forward in time until they're mentally tracing their own family trees and finally has them finish when they get to themselves. Mamut is also capable of limited clairvoyance, and it seems to be a common trait among shamans (for he mentions them displaying different powers). The point is that we have no information about what Ice Age people believed about psychic abilities, so Auel is really winging it here, especially on the ceremony of telepathic union. Some of the rest of it is based on what is known of the beliefs of traditional societies concerning ESP. It's left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">unclear</a> just how much is real though.

Ranec also has his ex-girlfriend Tricie who still carries a torch for him, and Jondalar has his (not present) ex-girlfriends Zolena/Zelandoni, Marona, and Serenio.

At first he is impressed, but eventually it becomes routine.

In an odd twist, we never find out their gender identity (they're simply called "Shamud", as the generic term for a shaman of their people). Also, they are commonly referenced, and LGBT individuals are said to be almost always powerful shamans, able to draw on the powers of both men and women.

The Clan think women get pregnant when her totem is defeated by a man's, whilst Others think that the Mother chooses to mix the spirits of a man and woman. Ayla figures out relatively early on that babies are actually made when a man and woman's 'essence' as she call it are joined via intercourse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She eventually gets the Zelandonii in on this revelation, which most people had been slow to catch onto, and it leads to the concept of fatherhood, whereas previously, a male 'parent' was simply called 'the man of my hearth' and may not even have necessarily been a child's biological father</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMissusAndTheEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMissusAndTheEx">The Missus and the Ex</a>: Jondalar is worried about introducing Ayla to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">First Love</a>, Zolena (Zelandoni).

Their brains are so huge that their heads have evolved to accommodate, making it very difficult for Clan women to give birth. In reality, <a class="urllink" href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/memory/where-are-memories-stored">memory is handled in a variety of places in the brain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and so is new learning and the kind of imagination necessary to invent new things, which the Clan supposedly lacks.

Frebec does play the heavy in the third book, but he gets better.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFathersAllowed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFathersAllowed">No Fathers Allowed</a>: All the cultures portrayed in the books have no concept of fatherhood, not realizing there's a connection between having sex and reproduction. While some do notice a resemblance between certain men and children, this is ascribed to their "spirit" affecting them. Thus a man will refer to one as the "child of their spirit", but this isn't viewed as a biological connection. Because of this, their sisters' children are a man's heirs, not any child whom their mate has. Children refer to their mother's mate as "the man of my hearth", though usually they have the <em>emotional</em> relationship a father would. However, in some cases this may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">not be their birth father</a> anyway, since sexual exclusivity isn't strictly enforced due to the aforementioned lack of knowledge that paternity exists (though a person's mate may be hurt if they have sex with another). Ayla realizes that men are needed to produce children, however, as a result of her observations. Despite initial skepticism, she eventually convinces people it's true and the series makes clear this will profoundly change culture into what is normal now.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon">No Guy Wants an Amazon</a>: Played straight in the Clan since Ayla is extremely tall and hideously misshapen to their eyes, and then averted by Jondalar and most of the Others, who have no problems with Ayla's self-sufficiency. Stands to reason, too: if you live in communities of 50-100 people or so, you'd be suicidal to turn down able-bodied workers just because they happen to have tits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeriodsPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeriodsPeriod">No Periods, Period</a>: Averted. Menstruation is mentioned several times and becomes semi-important to the plot occasionally. In the first book, Clan women (including Ayla) must isolate themselves whilst they're menstruating and aren't allowed to have contact of any kind with men. In the second book, Ayla frets over this a bit because she doesn't want to flout Clan traditions by being near Jondalar whilst she's on her period, but needs to be around him to tend his wounds and feed him due to him being incapacitated.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1d7pq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1d7pq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1d7pq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One wonders how Clan medicine women take care of injured guys while they're menstruating. Presumably they prepare medicines in advance. They also start training their daughters early, so these apprentice healers can help out.</span> Luckily, Jondalar and the rest of his people have no such taboos about periods. Later, Jondalar is able to count the marks she'd made on sticks to keep track of her menstrual cycle and figure out how long she's been living in the Valley (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAloner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAloner">alone</a></em>, we might add) and by extension how old she is. In <em>The Plains of Passage</em>, a Sharamudoi woman named Tholie gives Ayla straps made from plants and animal skins to use as sanitary napkins (with Auel describing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">how they're made and everything</a>) as a parting gift, knowing it saves Ayla having to find the materials to make her own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPreggerSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPreggerSex">No Pregger Sex</a>: Averted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ayla</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jondalar</span> have sex frequently during her pregnancy, though they tone it down in her final months due to physical discomfort.

Broud, and the rest of the clan, are even more taken aback, as the concept of women hunting is entirely foreign to them.

Part of the problem is that their unspoken cultural assumptions are totally incompatible; the other half of the problem is Jondalar's numerous silly hang-ups, unwillingness to just tell Ayla he's jealous, and rather low self-confidence. This trope nearly breaks Ayla and Jondalar apart permanently before the Mamutoi finally talk sense into them.<ul><li> What makes it worse is that the Lion Camp, for the most part, knows what is going on and no one truly attempts to intervene. Ayla and Jondalar, young and inexperienced as they are in long-term romantic relationships, are left to continue in misunderstanding, even when Jondalar is near-suicidal and Ayla gets engaged while in a compromised emotional state. Meanwhile, the older and wiser adults (particularly Mamut and Nezzie) continue to watch instead of attempting to explain. For example, Ayla, whose only consensual relationship was with Jondalar, gets involved with Ranec on the rebound. She had no way of knowing about 'rebound' prior, and none of the Mamutoi take the time to explain to or warn her. Mamut, who understands Clan values, explains the idea of consent to Ayla. However, he does not explain to Jondalar that with Ayla's Clan background, she honestly doesn't know why Jondalar is hurt and jealous after she goes to bed with Ranec. For that matter, no one explains to Ranec that Ayla took his invitation as a command, etc., etc.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a>: The spirits the Clan and the Others believe in.

The fact that she's into it immediately as he starts makes it come across like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization">"Not If They Enjoyed It" Rationalization</a>. There's also been some problem with communication between the pair, further complicating matters.</li><li> Second, in the third book when they go on a hunting trip, while Ayla is technically in a relationship with Ranec and Jondalar generally behaves like a Jerkass. Jondalar, pissed off and jealous, forces himself upon her and realizes this afterwards, and while Ayla insists that she is "always ready for him", and there's more communication breakdown here, he definitely did not ask for her consent.</li><li> Possibly Ayla and Ranec's first time. He propositions her and she seems to be under the impression she is obligated to go with him (due to the Clan training), in spite of the fact she finds him attractive. Mamut actually points out to her that it's her right to say no.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ayla</span> and Laramar in the sixth book, considering she was extremely drunk at the time.

Though Auel doesn't mention it, this brings up a possible reason for <em>why</em> a culture would guarantee girls have a magical first time: any woman who <em>can</em> have children will be willing to try, which is nice for population growth (or at least maintaining a population with realistic prehistoric mortality rates.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">A Real Man Is a Killer</a>: In the Clan, boys have to make their first kill on a hunt to prove their worthiness to the Clan.

Ayla manages to convince people over time however, pointing out how children usually resemble their mother's mates, virgins don't have them etc. It's hinted this is going to usher in a social revolution afterward, as men become more possessive over women as a result to make sure that their mates' children are theirs genetically.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>: This is the Clan standard of masculinity.

Some notable exceptions include Broud, Attaroa and the gangs led by Charoli and Balderan, who are straight-up evil (or their actions are), with no justification for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomensMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomensMysteries">Women's Mysteries</a>: Iza teaches Ayla about a special herbal tea she makes that can prevent pregnancy, known only to medicine women. Ayla in turn shares this secret with some other women she encounters, many of whom have never heard about it. Ayla makes a point of not telling any men, not even her lover Jondalar, as Iza had stated that Clan men probably wouldn&#146;t be too happy to find out there was a way to prevent pregnancy (Iza herself secretly took the tea to spite her abusive mate, who was seen as a &#145;lesser man&#146; due to the fact his mate had given him no children).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXOfY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXOfY">The X of Y</a>: Applies to the title of every book in the series, with the exception of <em>The Mammoth Hunters</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded">You Are Grounded</a>: Ayla's punishment for trying to force Brun into accepting her "deformed" son, Durc, is to have her freedom to come and go as she pleases curtailed. Initially, she is confined to Creb's hearth for a month, her existence unacknowledged by those who do not share the same living space. After that, she is forbidden to leave the area of the cave except to go on essential plant-gathering forays; even then, she has to ask Brun's permission and is under strict orders to return promptly. Her hunting privileges are also revoked. These restrictions remain in force until after Brun's clan return from the Clan Gathering.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>: The death curse, the ultimate punishment among the Clan causes those so cursed to <em>believe</em> they are dead (as does everyone else), and generally just lie down and die. If they didn't pine to death the co-dependent gender-based memories will get them; e.g., men can hunt but don't know how to butcher and preserve their kills, and literally can't learn to gather edible plants or cook. Women could gather vegetation but their only defense is running, with zero tracking skills to avoid danger, and they're totally unable to learn to hunt. A number of real cultures have death curses, wherein the entire tribe treats a member as dead, and eventually they give up and die. Anthropologists call this "voodoo death." Similarly, the kurdaitcha or bone-pointing curse found in some Aboriginal Australian groups is thought to cause death because the people cursed by it believe it will kill them, and then waste away slowly due to the nocebo effect (they later tried this on Europeans, but it didn't work).</li></ul></div><hr>
