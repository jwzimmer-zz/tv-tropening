Peace and good order are maintained throughout the empire by a large, efficient bureaucracy of highly-educated gentleman-scholars. Dee Jen-Djieh begins his career as a District Magistrate, the lowest rung of the provincial government. Over the years, he confronts and solves mysteries ranging from conspiracies against the throne to domestic disputes, with the help of his small staff of assistants:</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><ul><li> <em>Hoong Liang</em> - An old family retainer who the Judge appoints his sergeant of the tribunal. Most often referred to as "Sergeant Hoong".</li><li> <em>Ma Joong</em> - A former highwayman turned investigator. The uneducated son of a poor fisherman, in addition to his great size and strength he is a master martial artist, holding the "highest rank in boxing" (kung-fu, in modern terms). Admires strong-minded young women of common rank.</li><li> <em>Chiao Tai</em> - Ma Joong's best friend. Another ex-highwayman and fellow investigator, he is a rather mysterious fellow, obviously of gentle if not noble birth, with peculiarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalAttractor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalAttractor">fatal luck</a> in love.

The Judge values her for her sophistication, intelligence, and the tact with which she runs his household.</li><li> The <em>Second Lady</em> is not as highborn or well-educated as the First, but she is a handsome woman, at least in her husband's eyes, and possesses the kind of staunch, sensible character he admires.</li><li> The <em>Third Lady</em> is the highly-educated daughter of Dr. Tsao Ho-Hsien, an ambitious scholar, whom Dee met in the course of the investigation described in <em>The Chinese Gold Murders</em>. She was abducted and raped, and subsequently her husband and father disowned her because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">she refused to kill herself as dictated by custom</a>. The Judge first hired her as a companion for his ladies, and later married her at the urging of the First Lady.</li></ul><p>The four of them get along famously and while away their evenings with endless, hard-fought games of dominos. Dee's wives are minor characters in Van Gulik's novels and short stories, but the "sequel" novels by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lenormand (see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction">Fan Fiction</a> section below) change this by having his wives appear far more often, to the point of the First Lady being a main character.</p><p>The Judge himself is an unusually tall, powerfully built man with a long black beard, piercing eyes and considerable presence. Men, especially wrongdoers, find him intimidating, but women, sensing the sensitivity and empathy under the formidable surface, tend to trust and confide in him. Particularly attractive young women in trouble.</p><p>Judge Dee believes in the spirit of justice, rather than the letter of the law. His aim is not just to punish the wrongdoer but to reward those who do right, and ameliorate the sufferings of the victims as far as is possible. He often goes out of his way to help somebody only tangentially connected with his cases.</p><p><strong>Titles (in recommended reading order):</strong></p><ul><li> <em>The Chinese Gold Murders</em> (1959): Judge Dee sets out to take up his first post and finds a couple of juicy murders and a missing person case waiting for him.</li><li> <em>Judge Dee At Work</em> (1967): a collection of short stories including a chronology of the series.

The strangeness of the encounter compel him to record the cases and present them to the reader as the present work.

We later learn that this was based on Yuan's own life story (his wife was abducted, raped and whipped to death by a degenerate aristocrat) and this was the only form of revenge he had.

One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> even calls him out on it (before being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">Out-Gambitted</a> by the judge), leading the judge to realize his days of criminal investigations are over (both because he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> and now has to deal with political issues, and because his methods are by now known to criminals everywhere).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver">Sweet on Polly Oliver</a>: Miss Ting, a young actress, is disturbed by her strong attraction to fellow actress Miss Ou-Yang and asks the judge for advice. He tells her not to make any moves until she is quite sure of her own feelings and Miss Ou-Yang's intentions. He adds that as a free woman her love life is entirely her own business whatever she decides. And, as the trope name implies, Ou-Yang is actually a disguised man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">Sympathetic Murderer</a>: The Judge occasionally encounters these, including one who means a great deal to him, but never lets them off. One killed herself to spare him from having to make that decision.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TattooedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TattooedCrook">Tattooed Crook</a>: One of the victims in <em>The Phantom of the Temple</em>. According to the tattoo artist, ten coins extra would have gotten him the tiger's whiskers (and a different fate).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a>: Ma Jong and Chiao Tai, though they get more screen-time than is usual, and one story even has them witness a crime and take immediate action while the judge is away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">Third-Person Person</a>: Chinese etiquette <em>requires</em> this in court or other formal occasions: "This person begs to report a crime."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLinesSomeWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLinesSomeWaiting">Three Lines, Some Waiting</a>: Most novels concern a number of crimes that are all dealt with at once, in accordance with the Chinese traditions of crime fiction. Robert van Gulik comments in the postscript to <em>The Chinese Bell Murders</em> that he actually prefers this to "tighter" stories, as it corresponds closer to the toils of operating a court in real life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEnemyMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEnemyMinority">Token Enemy Minority</a>: As fits the Confucian POV of the original stories, Buddhists and Taoists are generally held in a certain amount of contempt by Dee, and a lot of stories will depict the local monastery as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>. However, there always seems to be at least one good monk who is disgusted by the corrupt behavior of his fellows, if not a broad base of genuinely devout monks unaware of the scoundrels in their midst. Itinerant priests, however, are generally crooks <em>pretending</em> to be actual friars <em>at best</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a>: The tribunal's head constable is almost universally a greedy, lazy, easily-corruptible brute and the constables not much better before the judge's lieutenants whip them into shape. The French translation goes further by calling them "sbires", which has the same negative connotations as "henchmen" or even "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl">Tomboy and Girly Girl</a>: Blue-white and Coral from <em>The Willow Pattern</em> are a tough, outspoken fighter and a shy, discreet dancer and musician, respectively. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ma Joong ends up marrying both.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopWife">Top Wife</a>: The titular character has three wives, the first of whom (aptly named "the First Lady" by the books) is the daughter of his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend">Best Friend</a> and generally runs the Judge's household though she delegates certain duties to Second and Third Lady. The other two view her as their 'Elder Sister' and superior, even though Dee himself does his best not to play favorites.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnInYourBadge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnInYourBadge">Turn in Your Badge</a>:<ul><li> In <em>The Chinese Lake Murders</em>, the judge uncovers a conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor in a town not far from the capital. The Imperial Inquisitor arrives in response to Dee's report, only to reprimand and suspend him for taking so long to uncover the plot (which higher-ups were already aware of). Dee is only reinstated because he deduces the hiding-place where the key to an encrypted list of all participants in the plot is concealed.</li><li> In <em>The Chinese Nail Murders</em>, the judge's failure to extract a confession from the murderess leads him to publicly declare he'll resign and accept the punishment given to the murderess. Fortunately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">someone who already used the exact same method to get rid of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> husband tells him what to look for.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a>: The character Judge Dee is based on the real Di Renjie (c. 630?-c. 700), and most of the plots are from actual Chinese sources, either fiction or real cases recorded for the edification of judges and coroners of the era. The forewords and afterwords of each book are as fascinating as the books, since van Gulik was a noted and respected scholar of Chinese culture. He did the illustrations, too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCall">Wake-Up Call</a>: In <em>The Chinese Maze Murders</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> painter has been happily sitting on his laurels by creating lurid imagery for Taoist monasteries rather than the elegant landscapes the Confucian administrators prefer, and having an extraordinarily high alcohol tolerance gives him a very good reason to enjoy renting an apartment above a wineshop. But after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the girl he fell in love with</span> is murdered, he decides to make something of himself in memory of her, including moving house... which the wineshop owner takes as a personal insult.<div class="indent">The painter had become a changed man. He had foresworn drinking, a decision which involved him in a bitter quarrel with his landlord, the owner of the Eternal Spring wineshop. The latter took this decision as a reflection on the quality of his stock. All winebibbers of that quarter sadly called this breach the end of a beautiful friendship.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchingTheReflectionUndress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchingTheReflectionUndress">Watching the Reflection Undress</a>: The judge's lieutenant Ma Joong is sent to interrogate a girl, who tells him to turn around while she's changing. He complies, and she turns around, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">clothes dropping to the floor</a>. She then tells him he can turn around now, but he replies that the mirror in front of him does the job just fine. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot">Sexy Discretion Shot</a> ensues.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName">Why Mao Changed His Name</a>: The books include lots of idiosyncratic romanizations of the characters' names. Curiously some names, chiefly the religious names of monks and the names of courtesans and some other female characters, are <em>translated</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWickedStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWickedStage">The Wicked Stage</a>: Mentioned in a story, where an actress tells the judge he probably thinks actresses are all prostitutes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Wife Husbandry</a>: An unintentional case with Captain Ni, who raised the orphaned daughters of the woman he'd loved, but they fall in love with him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The judge later confirms he's not their father</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardBeard">Wizard Beard</a>:<ul><li> The judge goes undercover as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FortuneTeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FortuneTeller">Fortune Teller</a> where his beard grants him considerable credibility. However, it also makes him recognizable, as a testifying Cheng Pa is horrified to see a soothsayer has been named Imperial judge before the situation is explained to him.</li><li> Doctor Tsao in the first story is a philosopher with a three-pointed beard, which gives the judge some insecurities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was actually a fake and the doctor a criminal</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>: In a non-combat situation, surprisingly enough. Investigating a monastery where women are granted children by a goddess (staffed by male monks), the judge tells Tao Gan to look for hidden passages, which he does disguised as a carpenter. Once he's satisfied there aren't any, the judge discards that theory... and it turns out there is a passage after all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>: Tao Gan pulls one off when followed by a suspect much larger than he is. Passing by a rack of clay jars, he upsets the whole thing onto his pursuer. When the employees come rushing out, the man claims he was attacked. They take one look at the shrimpy Tao Gan and the brawny accuser and decide for themselves what happened. Tao Gan ends his recollection saying that he left as they were breaking a jar on the man's head.</li></ul><p></p><hr>
