Both ended in early 2000, but the series was eventually revived in 2006 with the <em>Goosebumps Graphix</em> series (adapting classic books into comics), and further spinoffs were released in 2008-2012 (the twelve-book <em>Goosebumps HorrorLand</em> series, a crossover between new and existing characters - it also got a video game adaptation, and was continued with a second, seven-book story arc and then the six-book <em>Hall of Horrors</em> mini-series), 2012-2016 (<em>Goosebumps Most Wanted</em>, featuring a mix of classic and new villains in standalone stories) and 2017-ongoing (<em>Goosebumps SlappyWorld</em>, with each book introduced by Slappy the Dummy). There were also spinoff titles such as <em>Tales to give you Goosebumps</em> and <em>Goosebumps Triple Header</em></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>There were also a pair of PC games in the 1990s: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromHorrorland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromHorrorland">Escape from Horrorland</a></em>, a follow-up to the original <em>One Day at Horrorland</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AttackOfTheMutant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AttackOfTheMutant">Attack of the Mutant</a></em>, which had a different plot than the television episode or book with the same name.

He insists that he's pals with his son Jake and is constantly needling him to admit that his movies have scared him, saying "it's healthy to admit you're scared" in a patronizing way. It's blatantly clear Emory is an egotistical ass who just wants the satisfaction of his own son flat out admitting he is scared by the movies Emory makes, cementing him as "the King of Horror." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He gets his comeuppance in the end when Jake successfully scares him <em>twice</em> in a row.</span></li><li> Aaron Freidus' father in <em>The Werewolf In The Living Room</em> drags his son to a small European country to hunt a werewolf. He drags a <em>preteen</em> to go after a bloodthirsty monster.</li><li> Michael Webster's parents in 'The Cuckoo Clock of Doom'', <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">but only towards him</a>. They are extremely doting and loving towards their young daughter, Tara, who they see as an angel, and they never notice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">just how disturbingly rotten she is as a person</a> and in the process treat their son Michael like crap on a daily basis by letting Tara bully him and calling him a liar when he tries to defend himself. Even before Tara was born, Michael's father was mocking him as a baby for not being able to say full sentences yet and not being able to tie his shoes when he was slightly older. Michael's parents are much nicer to him later though when Michael is his own age again and Tara ceases out of existence.</li><li> Richard Dreezer's parents from <em>Dr. Maniac Will See You Now</em> not only constantly argue, but are always belittling him right in front of him and are only nice to his annoying little brother.</li><li> Kate Lipton's dad from <em>Lizard of Oz</em> likes to play cruel pranks on her sometimes, on top of blowing money on things like miniature horses. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> twist that he and his family are half lizard people</span> can only excuse so much.</li><li> Jonathan Chiller, the antagonist of the 2nd HorrorLand arc, had a mom that kept him inside all day to "nurture his mind" and his dad only protested because he wanted him to be a hunter like his father. When a hunt resulted in Jonathan getting hurt, his dad only laughed. Is it really no surprise he became as messed up as he is?</li><li> Downplayed, but Ian Barker's father in <em>Slappy Birthday To You</em> drives him out to an abandoned museum in the middle of nowhere as a birthday "surprise" and hires actors to scare him - then laughs at Ian's resulting distress - though it was not out of pure malice. His parents also tell him and his sister to be nice to their cousins, because his cousins are going through tough times, even when they know that their cousins are being downright to mean to them. It is worse for Ian though, because no one believes him when Slappy comes alive and starts doing all the mean things in front of everyone, his father, sister, and cousins eventually believe him though.</li><li> Tommy's parents in <em>Creature Teacher: The Final Exam</em> are not physically abusive, but they do mock their son for not being as competitive as them, and send him to Winner Island to toughen him up. They actually straight out just mock each other out of competition, but since he is not as completite as his sister and parents, he is picked on the most.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel">Actionized Sequel</a>: While the first <em>Deep Trouble</em> was an adventure story, the action was mostly in the last act, while the sequels feature more action and peril throughout the whole book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: The The <em>Goosebumps Graphix</em> version of <em>The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena</em> removes the bullies Kyle and Kara, and the Graphix version of ''A Shocker on Shock Street' removes Linda, the tour guide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAlternateEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAlternateEnding">Adaptational Alternate Ending</a>: The French novella adaption of "Good Friends" extends the ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dylan's older brother Richard still mocks Dylan for having imaginary friends, just as their mom comes home and asks if Richard's been playing with his imaginary little brother. Not only that, but Richard's pet spiders aren't real either because he's terrified of actual arachnids.</span><ul><li> The <em>Goosebumps Graphix</em> version of <em>The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena</em> changes the ending so that instead of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyle and Kara finding the magic snowballs, the final panel has the Abominmble Snowman standing in the middle of Pasadena, about to go on a rampage.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoringThePests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoringThePests">Adoring the Pests</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Monster Blood IV</em>, Andy thinks the blue Monster Blood creature is cute and pets it. The creature ends up multiplying when it drinks water and soon the town is overrun with blue Monster Blood creatures. Making matters worse is the fact that while the first creature starts off as docile and friendly, the resulting creatures get aggressive as it multiplies. The more creatures pop up, the more aggressive they are.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> In <em>The Werewolf of Fever Swamp</em>, Grady adopts a stray dog and names it Wolf. After some strange howls and disasters in the swamp, he wonders if Wolf is a werewolf. He isn't.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> <em>Let's Get Invisible</em>. Your kids discover something real cool, something that gives you an otherworldly high and "makes you invisible", but even if your kid wants to eventually stop his friends keep pressuring him to continue and they all keep doing it and doing it until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they're sucked into a lifeless world and seemingly replaced with a cold zombie-like counterpart</span>&#133; it's easy to see the story as a metaphor for adolescent drug addiction.</li><li> <em>The Horror at Camp Jellyjam</em>. Imagine being a parent who has sent their kid to a seemingly legit, if not oddly named, sports camp (though Wendy and Elliott &mdash; the main characters &mdash; actually crash-landed at the camp because the trailer attached to their car fell off and their parents didn't realize they were missing until later). Then you've lost contact with the camp. Then you learn that your children have been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> exploited for slave labor at the behest of a gigantic purple monstrosity that <em>ate</em> any kid that stopped working!</span></li><li> <em>I Live in Your Basement</em> definitely plays on people's fears of madness and obsession.<ul><li> If that's not enough, the first chapter actually starts off with a 12-year-old boy getting hit on the head with a baseball bat. The pain he experiences is told in full detail, and he is <em>put in a coma after the painful blow on the head!</em> Just imagine the pain after the full detail, especially in the perspective of a <em>preteen boy!</em></li></ul></li><li> <em>How I Learned To Fly</em> teaches readers that sometimes fear isn't found with ghosts, monsters, vampires, aliens from other planets, or freaky creatures. It can be found in people who want to exploit others' talents, obsessed fans who hound celebrities, and government agents who want people for scientific study.</li><li> "An Old Story" from <em>Still More Stories to Give You Goosebumps</em> presents readers with the premise of an elderly witch disguised as a loving, yet eccentric spinster aunt who physically ages her two young nephews with prunes to pimp them out to her equally elderly female friends for marriage.</li><li> The <em>Night of the Living Dummy</em> series. As several people, along with the blogger himself, pointed out on the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bloggerbeware.com">snarky Goosebumps blog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the <em>Night of the Living Dummy</em> series may be creepy as a child, but as an adult, a completely different layer of creepy reveals itself. The living dummy in question is obsessed with making preteen girls (and it's always girls, never boys in these books) into his slaves. When they refuse, he punches and slaps them - a rare act of physical violence for this series - and knocks one girl unconscious. In <em>Bride of the Living Dummy</em>, he goes further, demanding a 12 year old girl as his bride (instead of the female dummy), and calling his violence against her a "love tap". From adult eyes, it takes on a whole new meaning that flew over our heads when we were kids, with some really disturbing subtext... In the TV adaptation of <em>Night of the Living Dummy III</em>, it is shown that Slappy has demonically possessed or at least is using his powers on a young pre-teen boy. The effect is no less creepy than it was with the girls.</li><li> <em>Piano Lessons Can Be Murder</em>: This one is likely to be scarier for adults than for kids, not for the final third act, which generally those over the age of 8 would find cheesy. But for any person age 15 or older, especially if you or a friend/sibling is a parent, the fear of leaving your child or in the hands of a seemingly nice man who looks like Santa Claus but wants to hurt him (in which the third can be interpreted as an allegory for "never the same again") makes this in some ways scarier than horror books written for adults. Especially in light of the Jerry Sandusky scandal.</li><li> "Please Don't Feed The Bears" has one when Sarah is nearly an hour late to meet her parents for lunch while they're in a theme park. They chide her for making them wait, but it's obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">Anger Born of Worry</a> despite her parents saying they were having trouble entertaining her spoiled little sister Katie. Sarah wisely decides not to tell them that the Cuddle Bear employees nearly kidnapped her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and wanted her to become a bear</span>.</li><li> <em>The Girl Who Cried Monster</em>: Lucy's parents are clearly horrified when Aaron confirms <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that yes, Mr. Mortman is a monster and he nearly tried to kill Lucy for exposing him. It doesn't help that Mrs. Dark shooed Lucy to the library that morning and she realizes that she sent her daughter to a place where a predator works. Part of the reason they eat Mr. Mortman, in addition to keeping monsters from being found out, is to make sure Lucy is out of danger</span>.</li><li> <em>The Ghost Next Door</em>: Hannah finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she and her family died in a freak fire that she forgot to put out properly in the backyard. The opening chapter wasn't a dream; it was real</span>!</li><li> <em>The Curse Of Camp Cold Lake</em>: It's confirmed that you can die at Cold Lake, Camp, and the counselors will cover it up to ensure parents keep enrolling their kids. Sarah nearly becomes a casualty when she drowns in the lake.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's not that you'll drown most of the time; the woods are filled with poisonous snakes that you will trample on by accident. And of course, you'd only be in the woods if running away from camp, meaning no one knows where you are and you'll die alone succumbing to the poison. The worst part? <em>Two</em> kids died this way, and a third probably will be the end of the book</span>.</li><li> <em>Stay Out Of The Basement</em>: Margaret and Casey's mother has left them alone with their father, who they cannot trust and who is actively trying to cause them harm by turning them into plants. The idea that a parent can be untrustworthy, and that for kids, there can be very little escape from such a parent, is extremely frightening.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: Either that (with the grandparents in How To Kill A Monster being arguably the best example of this), or in on the conspiracy (as seen in such stories as <em>My Hairiest Adventure</em>, <em>Welcome to Camp Nightmare</em>, and <em>The Horror at Camp Jellyjam</em>).<ul><li> In <em>Say Cheese and Die... Again</em>, Greg is cursed to continually gain weight, putting on more than three hundred pounds in one day, and his parents chalk it up to an allergy attack and leave him to just go to school as normal the next day. Even though he can't fit in their car. Meanwhile, his friend Shari is cursed to continue to lose weight until she looks like "a stick with a lemon on the top", and again is just sent to school as normal.</li><li> <em>Chicken Chicken</em> is even worse. It's painfully obvious that Crystal and Cole are turning into chickens (what with their feathers appearing and their lips turning hard and beak-like) and the parents <em>DO NOTHING</em>. To make matters worse, they're preparing chicken for a barbecue in front of their affected kids <em>and</em> they laugh at Crystal and Cole when they start acting like chickens during the barbecue.</li><li> But even <em>they</em> are nothing compared to Michael Webster's parents in <em>The Cuckoo Clock of Doom</em>, in which they constantly dote on their youngest daughter Tara and refuse to believe Michael whenever the latter tells them about Tara's torment on him. Also, aside from the fact that they condone every misdeed Tara does to make Michael's life miserable (such as making Michael trip on his birthday cake and opening his presents), Michael gets beat up by a bigger guy thanks to Tara framing him for stealing the guy's cap, and when Michael returns home, his parents <em>don't even care that their only son had just gotten beat up by a bigger guy</em>, as opposed to their concern on Tara when she got a small cut on her leg when falling off Michael's bike for hopping on it earlier.</li><li> The grandparents in <em>How To Kill A Monster</em> are arguably the stupidest adults in the entire franchise. They wait until after the kids arrived to go and try to find help to kill the monster they caught and stored in the basement, deciding to lock the kids inside the house and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">tell them nothing, opting instead to leave notes on the fridge, which the kids find too late</a>, as they let the monster out due to an honest mistake. The grandparents hid the truth because they were "afraid that the parents wouldn't let the kids stay with them if they knew there was a monster in the house". And rather than taking the kids with them, the grandparents genuinely believe the kids are safer locked inside the house with the monster so long as they don't open a door. Main character Gretchen is furious at her grandparents' sheer stupidity, pointing out to stepbrother Clark that the grandparents won't be coming back with help because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">nobody will believe them about a monster in their house</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>:<ul><li> In <em>Welcome to Dead House</em>, the antagonists are friendly with the main characters except that they have to invite them over, especially Karen Somerset, who says she wants to be a nice person but everyone needs fresh blood to survive.

He just likes to play pranks and tell mean (but true) jokes, allowing the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFunnyToBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFunnyToBeEvil">to forget how dangerous he really is</a>.</li><li> The creatures from <em>The Beast Of The East</em> just see it as an elaborate game and outside of that are quite friendly.</li><li> Many of the antagonists from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GiveYourselfGoosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GiveYourselfGoosebumps">Give Yourself Goosebumps</a></em> series are this.</li><li> Della from <em>The Curse Of Camp Cold Lake</em> half the time was a normal kid outside of being a bloodthirsty ghost.</li><li> The plant clone father from <em>Stay Out Of The Basement</em> (more in the book than in the TV adaptation) tried to be a good father even though he was ultimately out to turn everyone into plant clones, even comforting the kids when they worried about things.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The ghost kids from <em>Ghost Beach</em>, who act like they just want to be friends.

It backfires when someone starts playing pranks on them, and they suspect an obnoxious camper named Bobby Judd. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out Bobby is a ghost that lures identical twins into dangerous, usually fatal skiing races</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a>: A lot of chapters tend to end with a dramatic statement that is obvious to the reader. For just one example, in <em>The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb</em>, two consecutive chapters end with the lines, "He had us cornered," and "We were being kidnapped." Both of these things are made completely obvious in the lines immediately before that.<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagLine">Tag Line</a> for <em>Attack of the Mutant</em> is "He's not a superhero, He's a supervillain!"

One of the most frequent examples has a character (usually the parents) claiming to believe the protagonist about what's happening, or even to be in on it themselves, only for the next chapter to immediately reveal that they were just joking, much to the protagonist's chagrin.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">Cats Are Mean</a>: Many books and stories, like <em>The Cat's Tale</em>, <em>Cry of the Cat</em>, <em>Claws</em> and <em>Night of a Thousand Claws</em> have supernatural, evil cats as the villains. Normal cats are usually depicted as lazy and mean towards the protagonists (Bonkers from <em>Piano Lessons Can Be Murder</em> being especially nasty). Stine himself said in an interview: "I've always been a dog person. You can tell I don't like cats&mdash;because I've written so many books with evil cats. It's much harder to imagine an evil dog."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare">Catapult Nightmare</a>: In both the book and TV episode of <em>Attack of the Jack-O-Lanterns</em>, Drew wakes up from a nightmare where her friends and herself are taken prisoner by a crazy old man and woman who "collect" trick-or-treaters with what they consider good costumes and lock them up in their attic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">Celebrity Is Overrated</a>: <em>How I Learned to Fly</em>'s moral to the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>:<ul><li> "Christopher Robin" in <em>Go Eat Worms!</em> and the Summoner in <em>The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb</em>.</li><li> <em>Who's Your Mummy?</em> has a more literal example, with the kids having squirt guns that end up being useful, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the villains are hurt by water.</span>. There's also the Molecule Detector Light in <em>My Best Friend is Invisible</em> and Tommy's lighter and Thalia's lipstick in <em>The Haunted School</em>.</li><li> This is oddly subverted in some books, with some seemingly important thing being given a lot of detail, such as Lucy's friend in <em>The Girl Who Cried Monster</em> having some fictional frisbee like toy which is given several pages of description, leading the reader to believe it will be somehow important to fighting the monster, only for it to never be brought up again. Whether this is deliberate or just bad writing is anyone's guess.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Chekhov's Gunman</a>: Chirpy in <em>Horrors of the Black Ring</em> at first seems to exist to be an example of how nice the protagonist Beth is, as she saves the bird from being run over and starts taking care of it. But after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chirpy dies of natural causes, Beth puts the ring on the bird's body as the ring's evil needs a body to be a vessel, so this defeats it.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsHobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsHobby">Chekhov's Hobby</a>: A common thing in some of the books is that a character will have some sort of quirk that becomes important later, such as Luke's pinching in <em>One Day at Horrorland</em> or Eddie's pickpocketing in <em>A Night in Terror Tower</em>.<ul><li> Becky in <em>Teenage Sponge Boys from Outer Space</em> watches the weather channel so much that she can predict when it will rain which comes in handy when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> distracts the sponge boys long enough for the rain to come and make their heads swell up, immobilizing them.</span>.</li><li> An interesting example comes with Mitchell's dad in <em>The Haunted Car</em>, who is a wannabe handyman, whose attempts to fix things often go wrong. Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he accidentally sets the house on fire while Mitchell is being taken for a joy ride by the ghost car.

A later example is Ian in <em>Slappy Birthday to You</em>, who's regularly subject to violence from his cousins and younger sister.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildEater">Child Eater</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Jellyjam</span>, the monster in <em>How To Kill A Monster</em>, Mr. Mortman, Cuddles the hamster, and the beasts in <em>The Beast From The East</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">Child Hater</a>: Several books have these, including <em>The Ghost Next Door</em> (a postman who <em>threatens kids with a shotgun</em>), <em>The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena</em> (Arthur), and <em>The Blob That Ate Everyone</em>.

The back cover blurb summary heavily implies that the magic mixture the protagonist, Jack, uses to make himself fly was cursed or had some sort of supernatural consequence, but the problems he really faces are more based in reality.</li><li> <em>Deep Trouble</em> shows a threatening shark on the cover which would suggest a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em>-inspired story, but has a story about friendly mermaids instead, with the shark only appearing in a small portion of the book.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://goosebumps.wikia.com/wiki/Be_Careful_What_You_Wish_For...?file=1270367_100516131628_be_careful_1.jpg">The UK cover of ''Be Careful What You Wish For''<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> shows a shattered crystal ball with Samantha's face reflected in it. There is a crystal ball in the story, but it never breaks. The picture could also be interpreted as Samantha being trapped in the crystal ball, which doesn't happen either. The <em>other</em> notable thing about the cover is a major spoiler.</li><li> Sometimes, people anticipating that the cover is fake works in the book's favor. In the TV version of <em>Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main bad guys aren't the beings with the Pumpkin heads on the cover... which is expected. However, the aliens who save the kids from the monsters <em>were</em> the Pumpkin-headed beings</span>.</li><li> The famous cover of <em>The Curse of Camp Cold Lake</em> features a red-eyed skull with no nose rising out of the water. This creature never shows up in the book, and instead the antagonist is a ghost girl who, despite being partly transparent, is normal enough that Sarah doesn't immediately realize she's even a ghost.</li><li> The <em>Horrorland</em> books do this fairly consistently. The cover to <em>Monster Blood for Breakfast</em> for example features (presumably) the protagonist engulfed in the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Blob Monster</a>, while the main section of the book actually deals with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>. <em>Who's Your Mummy</em> features a mummy ringing a doorbell; the only stereotypical mummies in the book are immobile.</li><li> The ghost on the cover of <em>The Haunter</em> is nowhere to be seen in the story, as the ghost is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> just a kid</span>.</li><li> The cover of <em>The Cuckoo Clock of Doom</em> shows a creepy-looking bird emerging from a cuckoo clock, implying that it's the villain of the story. The book is actually about a magic clock that allows its user to travel through time, and which the protagonist uses to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> erase his sister from existence</span>. Evil cuckoo birds don't figure into it at all.</li><li> The <em>Most Wanted</em> series falls victim to this a lot. It's hard to believe their claim of the series containing the "most wanted" monsters when they are often not the ones depicted on the cover. The worst offender is <em>Frankenstein's Dog</em> which is actually about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> evil robots, and the dog never becomes a monster.</span></li><li> The cover for <em>Son of Slappy</em> makes it seem like the title will be literal, with Slappy somehow having an offspring.

Sarah then reveals to everyone that Jan has asthma, and it was an honest accident as well, plus even if accidental, it was the right thing to do anyway, as Jan hiding her condition could've very easily put her health at risk. The three girls react to these rather annoying yet minor offenses that Sarah apologized for by shunning and bullying her, including pretending to be friendly so they can slip a snake down her back, and Jan even <em>tips the canoe</em> as revenge, knowing that Sarah's a bad swimmer, and then tells the counselor that Sarah did it.

Hannah was upset that she couldn't go to summer camp with her friend Janey, and her brothers similarly were bummed. To cheer them up, she lit a campfire in their suburban backyard and they spent the night telling ghost stories, enjoying each other's company. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A neighbor who's a realtor reveals after Hannah learns she is a ghost, that Hannah failed to put out the fire properly, due to not knowing any better as a city kid. The fire spread and burned down the house, while the parents and kids were sleeping. There is a reason why campers are generally taught safety rules before starting campfires.

No one is wearing lifejackets, and the water isn't buoyant. Cue Sarah diving to the bottom of the lake, holding her breath...and she drowns for real because remember, she can't swim. The counselor was fortunately on the ball and pulled her out while administering CPR.

The best example is probably <em>My Hairiest Adventure</em> when for most of the book, Larry believes that the fur growing on his hands and body is from expired tanning lotion and could be behind the disappearances of his friends and why there are a lot of dogs in the neighborhood. Turns out the expired tanning lotion had nothing to do with it, and the fur, disappearing friends, and influx of dogs was from a local doctor's dog-to-human serum wearing off.<ul><li> <em>The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb</em> has a clever subversion. Early on, Gabe and Sari are chased through a museum by Ahmed, who seems to have some sinister reason for going after them. When he finds them, he tells them he was only trying to give them a message from Gabe's uncle, and isn't sure why they ran from him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, this turns out to be a lie, and he tries to kidnap them immediately afterwards.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayOfHopeEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayOfHopeEnding">"Ray of Hope" Ending</a><ul><li> <em>I Am Your Evil Twin</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nan discovers the Monty she picked is really one of the evil clones, and he reveals how he carefully set it up so Nan and her father would believe he was the real Monty.

However, Thalia can just as easily open another doorway into the color world using her lipstick if it still has its color by the time Tommy and the others show up. And even if it doesn't, Tommy can most likely burn open a doorway using his lighter, or any of the many other kids in their class can easily have an object that can allow them to open a doorway.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed Richards Is Useless</a>: This comes up quite a lot, given a lot of the stories about science gone wrong.<ul><li> The Shopkeeper in <em>The Haunted Mask</em> could've revolutionized surgery and ended permanent disfigurement, if he improved on his "mask making" skills.</li><li> Dr. Brewer in <em>Stay out of the Basement</em> originally tries to splice different plant species together into bigger crops, thus solving world hunger.

He basically lives his life tormenting kids just for kicks, especially younger kids, and he gets off on seeing them be frightened and suffer. It gets to a point that when his mother (who clearly dislikes her son's behavior) forces him to accompany his little sister, cousin and two of his sister's friends to go trick-or-treating on Halloween, he ditches the three girls by leaving them all alone on a dark street and then locks his scared cousin in an abandoned house, all so he can then go scare other kids and steal their candy, then sneaks into his teacher's house to vandalize it and downright abandons his best friend (a bully himself) when they find that there are guard dogs who have caught on to them.</li><li> Judith from <em>Be Careful What You Wish For</em>, who comes across as downright sadistic in her hatred of Samantha, using basically every waking moment to torment her, never once showing any redeeming characteristics or even the slightest sign that she's not just downright nasty.</li><li> Micah, Wade's teenage brother in <em>Revenge R Us</em> is basically a teenage male version of the above mentioned Tara Webster, existing solely to make his little sister's life a living hell just because he feels like it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a>:<ul><li> <em>The Ghost Next Door</em>, mainly for its incredibly somber, dirge-like tone and where the main twist is slowly revealed rather than delivered suddenly for the series usual Gothcha! effect (and the rare time it doesn't even end up serving as the book's main climactic plot crux).</li><li> <em>You Can't Scare Me</em>: Even though this story does have and mention monsters (the mud monsters said to be the corpses of the town's original settlers who died in a mudslide), most of the focus of the story is on four friends playing scary pranks on a girl named Courtney, who claims that she's not scared of anything, to prove her wrong &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">with comic results</a>.</li><li> <em>How I Learned to Fly</em>: Despite implications that the flying formula had supernatural powers from the back cover blurb, the story is scary in a real-world sense, showing that talent is often exploited by the greedy (Jack's father is an agent who puts his son in cheesy car commercials when he learns that his son can fly while Jack's rival, Wilson, has his own tv show), how celebrities can be "trapped" because of constant media attention and obsessed fans, and the government wanting to know the secrets of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> for the good of the country (allegedly). It plays out more like a supernatural satire on the burden of being a celebrity and American's society obsession with success and being famous.</li><li> <em>Deep Trouble</em> is another example. Most books before it dealt with clumsy, generic kids stumbling into adventures with gross monsters. The protagonist here is a dangerously overconfident kid who seeks out adventure and discovers a mermaid on a trip to the Caribbean. The real conflict comes from him debating whether to go along with his uncle's plans to sell her to a zoo, or do the right thing and return her home. Also, the villains, rather than being monsters or mad scientists, are greedy thieves looking to exploit the mermaid for their own intentions. And the shark on the cover barely appears at all, ruining any expectations of this book being like a kids' version of <em>Jaws</em>. There <em>is</em> a genuine monster, but its role is relatively small.</li><li> The Series 2000 books <em>Are You Terrified Yet?</em> and <em>Scream School</em> have <em>no</em> supernatural events at all (and the monsters are revealed to be people in elaborate costumes playing a prank on someone), and takes place in the "real" world.</li><li> <em>Fright Camp</em> is also another example of this, as it turns out all the supernatural elements are staged since it's set at a fantasy summer camp run by a famous horror movie director. The short story <em>Thumbprint of Doom</em> also ends up lacking supernatural elements, as well as <em>The Mummy With My Face</em>.</li><li> <em>The Mummy Walks</em> from the <em>Goosebumps 2000</em> series is nothing like <em>The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb</em> or <em>The Return of the Mummy</em> from the original Goosebumps series. Instead, it has more adventure and international intrigue (in the book, the main character, who thinks he's going to Florida on vacation, is actually the orphaned prince of a Middle Eastern country who needs to be sent back so he can retrieve a mummy and stop the country's current civil war).</li><li> <em>Slappy's Nightmare</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode">focused on Slappy</a> rather than the kid who gets him, and serves as a subversion of the typical Slappy book formula.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Space Whale Aesop</a>:<ul><li> The "moral" of <em>Go Eat Worms</em> is basically "don't be mean to worms or a giant worm will eat you", which doesn't work since giant worms aren't real, and also counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> since the worm is scared off before it can eat the protagonist. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end there is another example, as Todd takes to pinning butterflies instead, only to get attacked by a giant butterfly with a pin, the implication he is going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">Impaled with Extreme Prejudice</a>.
