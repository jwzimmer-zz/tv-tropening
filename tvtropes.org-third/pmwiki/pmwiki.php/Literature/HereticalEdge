The girl was completely locked out of the supernatural world and left unaware of the dangers to her life. She's the lucky one, because her brother grew up in an abusive home under "parents" that didn't care about him and were ready and willing to murder him if ordered. He became an incredibly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> man who doesn't trust anyone and is constantly fighting down panic attacks.</li><li> Her third child, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Flick Chambers</span>, grew up under the same surveillance as her older siblings but, like her sister, remained ignorant of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unlike her siblings, Flick has the attention of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a> that plans to enslave her as soon as he's allowed to by the deal Joselyn made to keep him from doing so when she was seven.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then there's Ammon, the son Joselyn has had to watch Fossor raise to be a monster right in front of her.</span></li></ul></li><li> The Akharu warrior Tiras had to leave his wife and daughter behind in order to fight a war against a race of enemies that would kill them for being part Akharu. He hasn't seen either of them in over two hundred years.<ul><li> Centuries later, his wife Jiao gave her younger daughter (by a different man) Reathma up for adoption in order to protect her from her enemies. She was worried enough that she let the man she gave the baby to rename her for fear of leaving any trace that could connect them.</li></ul></li><li> Haiden and Sariel Moon were both flung literally worlds away from their twin children, one of whom was also sucked into the same dimensional portal that took them. They haven't been seen in a decade.</li><li> Sands and Scout's mother was abducted by a Stranger while on an outing with ten year old Scout (who still went by Sarah at the time). The "bad man" then attempted to use her likeness and voice to lure Sarah out and take her as well. Thankfully, Mrs. Mason's Alter friend was there and hid Sarah so the Nocen couldn't find her.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Said friend was Sariel, and she didn't so much hide Sarah as fling herself, Larissa, and the Nocen into different dimensions, sacrificing her own chance to get back to her family in the process.</span></li></ul></li><li> An argument can be made that Crossroads Academy and Eden's Garden kidnap their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Bystander</a> students. That's probably how their parents would see it if the schools didn't modify their memories to make them think they sent their kids to a prestigious private school (Crossroads) or a military academy (Eden's Garden). Both organizations leave the final choice of whether or not to join up to the recruits themselves, but those recruits are minors.<ul><li> In very rare cases, the Crossroads Committee is willing to at least discuss abducting Bystander children from their families to be raised by Heretics, although they wouldn't put it in those terms. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They came very close to having Flick taken from her dad after Joselyn disappeared.</span></li><li> Eden's Garden has a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>fifty percent</em> mortality rate for their trainees</span>. We can safely say that the vast majority of parents would <em>not</em> be okay with that.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>: To an extent. Pretty much every mythological creature really does exist, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Bystander Effect</a> makes it difficult to comment on the truthfulness of the myths themselves.<ul><li> The myths about individuals get massively twisted. For instance, in Heretical Edge's take on the Arthurian Mythos, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Arthur and Merlin are the same person, with Merlin a disguise Arthur used for great magical works to conceal his full abilities, and Lancelot is a disguise that Guinevere put on when she was out kicking ass for the sake of appearances.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>: Because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Bystander Effect</a> is constantly censoring the memories of ordinary human beings, history has played out very differently from how Bystanders believe it did (how it happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>). Crossroads even has a Bystander History class where they teach their students what Bystanders think happened so they don't cause any confusion while interacting with them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a>. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">Crossroads Academy</a>, all Strangers everywhere are pure evil monsters out to prey on humanity. It's made clear early on that this is bullshit. Sapient nonhumans are just as complex and nuanced as humans. That said, a lot of the nonhumans Crossroads Heretics comes into contact with are legitimately dangerous because peaceful Alters know to not attract attention. And there really are Strangers that are as bad as Crossroads claims. Or worse.<ul><li> Sands describes the Heretics of Eden's Garden this way as well, which is also bullshit. Eden's Garden does operate in some areas that Crossroads considers evil, but one of those areas is using Strangers for their benefit instead of killing them.</li><li> The closest we have to races that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> in this series are the Seosten and the Fomorians, although they're closer to being always <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Did Joselyn leave willingly, as Flick and her father think? Or did Ammon's father use mind control powers similar to their son's to abduct her? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Further complicating matters is the revelation that Joselyn was once a Heretic, and that it's possible to return Heretics to being human at the cost of their powers and memories of the supernatural</span>.

After all, she and Shiori were the first human girls Tristan met since he was seven at the age of twelve, right when he was hitting puberty. So when he meets up with them again at seventeen (after time travel shenanigans, so for them it was only a few weeks and they're all the same age), it makes perfect sense that he'd crush on them.
