Still, the next king will institute the same blasphemous practices of his predecessor and suffer the same fate.<ul><li> More specifically, Ahab witnesses God&#146;s miraculous victory over Baal at Mount Carmel and the subsequent slaughter of Baal&#146;s priests. Yet when he flees back to Jezreel and reports what happened to Jezebel, he consents to her plan to have Elijah killed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>: Solomon marries Pharaoh&#146;s daughter and many other foreign princesses, which ultimately leads him to worship their gods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">Anti-Magical Faction</a>: Judea under King Josiah.

Some of this is due to Values Dissonance (the narrator's main complaint against him is that he was tolerant of other religions, which many modern secular people will not think was <em>that</em> evil), but he also has many traits that would seem positive even at the time. For example, he is a capable soldier and statesman, brave in battle and yet magnanimous in victory (sparing the defeated Aramaeans and making an alliance and trade agreement with them instead of slaughtering them), and dies heroically fighting for his country. (Outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, other old records also show that he was one of the leaders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a> against the Assyrians, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> of the day.) In fact, other than his liberal religious policy, the only unambiguously evil things his regime is ever really shown to do aren't even initiated by Ahab, but are either done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">at Jezebel's instigation</a>, or even done by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend">behind his back</a>&mdash;and after her major atrocity (the judicial murder of the innocent farmer Naboth), Ahab is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">terribly regretful and ashamed</a> about this. Of course, <em>as the king</em> he is still ultimately responsible for everything (and never punishes Jezebel for any of the evil things <em>she</em> does), but his characterization is very far from the cackling villain he is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">flanderized</a> as in adaptations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>: Elijah accuses the people of Israel of being this, but they continue their apathy until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodTest">Elijah defeats the priests of Baal at Mount Carmel</a>.<div class="indent">&#147;And Elijah came near to all the people and said, &#145;How long will you go limping between two different opinions?

This is contested in 2nd Chronicles chapter 21, when years later from this event King Jehoram was given a letter written by Elijah telling him that he was going to die of an incurable sickness due to his terrible reign of Judah. It is also likely that the letter was written by his successor Elisha and that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongfullyAttributed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongfullyAttributed">Wrongfully Attributed</a> to Elijah by the author of the Chronicles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>: King Jehoram of Judah, for his terrible reign of his kingdom, including slaughtering his brothers in order to keep the throne. Also Queen Jezebel, for her persecution and slaughter of the prophets of God among other things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttendingYourOwnFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttendingYourOwnFuneral">Attending Your Own Funeral</a>: In 2nd Kings 13:21, some Israelites who were in the middle of burying a dead man suddenly saw a Moabite raiding party, so they dropped the body into Elisha's tomb and ran off. When the body touched Elisha's bones, the man came to life and stood on his feet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning">Awesome Moment of Crowning</a>:<ul><li> Solomon&#146;s inauguration was so loud that Joab could hear the trumpets from miles away in En-Rogel!</li><li> Subverted at Rehoboam&#146;s inauguration, when Jeroboam interrupts it to demand Rehoboam make reforms.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyBeMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyBeMine">Baby Be Mine</a>: In the case that was brought before King Solomon of two prostitutes that became mothers, one of the women accidentally killed her own son while sleeping with him, so she swapped the dead child with the other woman's living child. Now the both of them were complaining that the living child was their own and the dead child was the other woman's. Solomon settled this by threatening to slice the living baby in two and giving each woman half a child, with the woman that pleaded for the child to be spared and given to the other woman revealed to be the actual mother of the living child.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>:<ul><li> In 1 Kings 17:8-24, After Elijah was directed to a house in Zarephath and he supplied food to a widow and her son, the boy felt ill and became breathless. Elijah prays to God <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">three times</a>, hoping that God would let the boy's life return to life. God heard Elijah's cry and returned the boy's life to him, resurrecting the child.</li><li> Elisha did two, in 2 Kings 4:32-37, he prayed to God to resurrect the son of a Shunammite woman while staying with the child, and the other one is done posthumously in 2 Kings 13:21, by having a corpse landed onto the bones of Elisha.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven">Bargain with Heaven</a>: God promises Solomon that &#147;if you walk in My ways, keeping my statutes and commandments as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days&#148; (1 Kings 3:14, ESV). For much of Solomon&#146;s life, he stayed true to his word, and Israel reached the height of its power. Once Solomon broke his word, Israel&#146;s slow decline began.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearerOfBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearerOfBadNews">Bearer of Bad News</a>: Johnathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, was the one who gave Adonijah the bad news that his father had just had his half-brother Solomon crowned as king over Israel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Bears Are Bad News</a>: Elisha summons two bears to maul 42 young bandits for mocking his bald head (and possibly implying that they would send him to heaven, i.e., kill him, although the phrase could also mean "why didn't you go up to heaven [like Elijah did]"?).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BequeathedPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BequeathedPower">Bequeathed Power</a>: In 2nd Kings chapter 2, before Elijah is taken up into heaven in a whirlwind, his assistant and future successor Elisha asks to have a double portion of his spirit to perform miracles with. Elijah replies, "That is a difficult thing to ask; however, if you see me going up, it will be so, but if you don't see me go up, it will not be so." True to Elijah's word, Elisha saw Elijah being taken up with his mantle falling to the ground, and Elisha picks up the fallen mantle and uses it to divide the Jordan River to cross over it safely, causing the sons of the prophets to recognize that the power of Elijah now rests on Elisha.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWordShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWordShout">Big Word Shout</a>: "TREASON! TREASON!" from Queen Athaliah when she realized Jehoiada the priest and the people plotted to put Joash, the rightful heir of the Davidic kingdom, on the throne behind her back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindSeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindSeer">Blind Seer</a>: Ahijah the Shilonite becomes this in 1st Kings chapter 14 around the time King Jeroboam's son Abijah becomes sick. Although Jeroboam's wife is told to disguise herself when approaching the prophet so that he would not recognize her, God tells Ahijah ahead of time who's coming to see him, and so instantly addresses her and her situation the instant she steps in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">Blood Bath</a>: In some translations, 1st Kings 22:38 states that the prostitutes washed themselves in the blood that came from King Ahab when he died in his chariot returning home from his failed attempt to reclaim Ramoth Gilead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodIsSquickerInWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodIsSquickerInWater">Blood Is Squicker in Water</a>: In 2nd Kings chapter 3, after God gives the kings and armies of Israel, Judah, and Edom the miracle of water to drink, the king and army of Moab goes out early in the morning and sees that those same ditches filled with water now appear to be filled with blood, making the king of Moab assume that the three opposing armies have killed each other.

His distant successor Amon, by contrast, is just evil throughout and has nothing good said about him, though fortunately he had a short reign before he was killed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodRunningEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodRunningEvil">Good Running Evil</a>: When King Sennacherib of Assyria planned on destroying Jerusalem and King Hezekiah of Judah prayed to God, God through the prophet Isaiah has a message sent to the Assyrian king to tell him that he is just a vessel in God's hand for the purpose of destroying kingdoms whose gods aren't really gods, and that because of his rage against God Himself, God will have him destroyed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaKillThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaKillThemAll">Gotta Kill Them All</a>: Jehu kills <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingFamilyMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingFamilyMassacre">every descendant of Ahab</a> and priest of Baal that he can get his hands on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousPrincess">Gratuitous Princess</a>: King Solomon's marriages was with 700 of them, just to show how powerful and lust-driven the character was.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>: Elisha's servant Gehazi in 2nd Kings chapter 5 was greedy for a reward Naaman the Syrian was offering that Elisha had rejected, so he secretly went to Naaman to get the reward himself. However, Elisha knew what his servant did and thus cursed him with leprosy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianAngel">Guardian Angel</a>: God provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">an invisible army of horses and chariots of fire</a> to protect Elisha from the Syrian army.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingSpring">Healing Spring</a>: The Jordan River, which in itself provided no supernatural healing, but Naaman the Syrian was told to dip himself in it seven times to be cleansed of his leprosy. Naaman refused to do this at first, claiming that the rivers in his own country are far better rivers to be dipped in, but Naaman eventually gives in and thus is cleansed of his leprosy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>: Chronicles describes King Manasseh who "filled the land with innocent blood from one end to the other" returning to God late in life after his enemies took him captive. They returned him to his kingdom (though his son Amon was on the throne by then) to live out the remainder his life. Most likely the basis for the apocryphal <em>Prayer Of Manasseh</em>. Considering that he was Josiah's grandfather (and Josiah's reign started when he was just eight years old), it seems likely that Manasseh passed some of the lessons he'd learned on to his grandson, warning him not to go ticking off God the way he (and his son Amon) had with all the evil they'd done.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">Heel&#150;Faith Turn</a>: A favorite verse used by modern-day Evangelicals is 2nd Chronicles 7:14, which was originally spoken to King Solomon by God in regard to the people of Israel: "If My people, who are called by My name, will humble themselves and pray, and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and will heal their land."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">Heir Club for Men</a>: Usually kingship in Israel and Judah would pass on to one of the king's sons, though near the final years of Judah's existence as a kingdom, when King Jehoahaz was deposed and brought as a prisoner to Egypt, his brother Eliakim took his place and was renamed King Jehoiakim. Then after Jehoiakim's son King Jehoiachin was deposed and taken to Babylon, Jehoahaz' other brother Mattaniah took his place and was renamed King Zedekiah. It was hardly ever given to one of the king's daughters, which was part of why after King Ahaziah died, his mother Athaliah killed all but one of the king's sons (who escaped slaughter by being secreted away by the king's sister) so she could become queen herself, though it lasted only until the king's son (Joash) was old enough to assume his rightful place on the throne.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">Henpecked Husband</a>: King Ahab comes off as rather wimpy in these books, allowing his domineering wife Jezebel control the country.

However, it's most explicit with Josiah, who is said to have destroyed the homes of the <em>qedeshim</em> in Jerusalem (and then presumably either killed them or deported them out of the kingdom, the text isn't quite clear on that). <em>Qedeshim</em> is translated as "sodomites" in the King James Version&mdash;other Bible translations can render it a little differently, but most agree that it has something to do with homosexuality.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitMeDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitMeDammit">Hit Me, Dammit!</a>: In 1st Kings 20:35-37, a prophet of God needs to be beaten and bruised in order to deliver the message God had for King Ahab regarding the king of Syria that he granted mercy unto after handing him two defeats with the help of God. The first person he asks to injure him refuses, and is killed by a lion for refusing to obey God's command.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGround">Holy Ground</a>: King David's palace is treated as that by King Solomon in 2nd Chronicles since the Ark of God had been there, so he had his wife, the Pharaoh's daughter, moved into a separate palace built for her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyIsNotSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyIsNotSafe">Holy Is Not Safe</a>:<ul><li> In 1st Kings, Adonijah, and later, Joab, fled to the tabernacle when they were in danger of being killed.

King Ahab hates Micaiah because "he never prophesies anything good, but bad." When Micaiah is asked for his prophetic advice concerning whether the kings should engage in the battle or not, Micaiah sarcastically agrees with the words of King Ahab's other prophets that the kings should engage in the battle &mdash; until King Ahab reminds Micaiah to only tell the truth in the name of the Lord, and then Micaiah prophesies to the effect that they should refrain because King Ahab will fall in the battle. That only confirms in King Ahab's mind about what he thought of the prophet, but Micaiah also tells the king that God had purposely sent a lying spirit to the mouths of his other prophets so that he would engage in the battle and fall. King Ahab orders that Micaiah would be put into prison and be fed bread and water until he returns in peace, but Micaiah warns that if King Ahab ever returns in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a>: Chronicles ends with the proclamation of Cyrus the Great allowing the Jews to return to their homeland.

One mother thought the ruling fair, but the other begged Solomon, "Give the baby to her, just don't kill him!"

Thus was fulfilled what Elisha had prophesied, that a measure of fine flour would be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel.</li><li> In 2nd Chronicles chapter 20, King Jehoshaphat and his army came down to the Wilderness of Tekoa and sang praises to God, and because of this, the Ammonites and the Moabites ended up defeating each other, causing so great a slaughter that it took three days for Jehoshaphat and his men to take all the plunder.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">Polyamory</a>: The case for the kings of both Judah and Israel, though for Solomon, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven">Turned Up to Eleven</a>, for he had 700 wives and 300 concubines.

As soon as she begins a persecution of Jahve's prophets, this is treated as proof of how evil Jezebel is. Which would have been fair...

Then vain, worthless men gathered together around him and defied Rehoboam son of Solomon. And Rehoboam was young and timid in heart and was not strong before them. And now you think that you can withstand before the kingdom of the Lord by the hand of the sons of David. And you all are a great multitude, and with you are the golden calves that Jeroboam has made for you to be gods. Have you all not driven out the priests of the Lord, even the Levites and sons of Aaron, and made for yourselves priests from the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to be dedicated and has in his hand a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest to what is not a god. But for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not abandoned Him. And our priests serve the Lord and are sons of Aaron, Levites with their service. They sacrifice burnt offerings to the Lord every morning and evening and put out an incense of spices. They also set the showbread in place on the ritual table and set the golden lampstand with its lamps to burn every evening. For we keep the duty of the Lord our God, but you all have abandoned Him.

All Hezekiah could say to that is, "The word of the Lord that you have spoken is good," for the narrative says he was thinking, "At least I will have peace and safety in my days."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Space Whale Aesop</a>: Don't insult and threaten God's prophets, or God might just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">summon bears to maul you</a>. (God apparently preferred something a little more original than a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Bolt of Divine Retribution</a> this time around.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">Spare to the Throne</a>: King Joash of Judah, the only surviving heir of the Davidic kingdom, was spared from Queen Athaliah's wrath and raised in secrecy until he was old enough to assume the throne with Jehoiada the priest as co-regent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>: Many of Israel's kings became king after betraying and assassinating the former king, then proceeded to kill off their entire family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">Straight for the Commander</a>: In what would be King Ahab's final battle, the king of the Syrians ordered his charioteers to only attack the king of Israel (Ahab). Seeing King Jehoshaphat of Judah on the battlefield in his royal robes, they assumed that he was the king of Israel and went after him, but left him alone after he revealed (or God revealed, according to the 2nd Chronicles account of the same event) that he was not the king of Israel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckSessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckSessor">Sucksessor</a>: Terrible kings often followed good ones, but every once in a while good kings followed terrible ones. (At least in Judah, anyway. The book of Kings grades all of Israel's rulers as evil.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>: In 1st Kings chapter 18, when God ends the drought over the northern kingdom of Israel by sending rain, He gives the prophet Elijah this kind of power when he outraces King Ahab on foot all the way to the entrance of Jezreel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingUpTheMantle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingUpTheMantle">Taking Up the Mantle</a>: Elisha, both figuratively and literally, when he succeeds Elijah as the prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel when Elisha sees Elijah being taken up to heaven in a whirlwind. The mantle which Elijah used to part the waters of the Jordan when he and Elisha crossed over did the same thing when Elisha used it to cross back over the Jordan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">A Taste of the Lash</a>: King Rehoboam, by the bad advice given to him by the men who grew up with him, tells the other tribes of Israel that "my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions," referring to a more painful form of physical punishment (most likely chains) that made whips seem lighter by comparison.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">Teens Are Monsters</a>: The prophet Elisha encounters a gang of malicious youths who insult his baldness and basically tell him to drop dead. God returns the favor by allowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">two she-bears</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">to maul forty-two of them</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bullying a Dragon</a>, indeed. One translation calls these bullies "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">little children</a>", yet it is far more likely that they were adolescents at youngest.<ul><li> Some of the bad kings rose to power when they were teenagers. One that stands out is Jehoiachin. A copyist's mistake claims that he rose to power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">at the tender age of eight</a>, but the correct translations verify that he was in fact <em>eighteen</em> when he became king.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">The Theocracy</a>: The kingdom of Israel, and its successor state, the southern kingdom of Judah, were this until the time of its dissolution when the Babylonians conquered it centuries later, with the reigning king (in ideal, if not always in practice) and his people subject to God's laws. How often they were faithful in keeping those laws depended on the king reigning at the time, although the high places were not removed until the time of King Hezekiah. The ten tribes that broke away and formed the northern kingdom of Israel fell into woshiping the calves erected at Bethel and Dan, and during the dynasty of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, Baal worship until it was stopped by Jehu son of Nimshi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">This Is Unforgivable!</a>: King Manasseh shed so much innocent blood in Jerusalem that the writer of 2nd Kings says God couldn't forgive such an action, which became the reason that Judah was overrun by the Babylonians and its people taken into exile.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroneMadeOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroneMadeOfX">Throne Made of X</a>: Solomon's throne demonstrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">just how wealthy and powerful he was</a>.<div class="indent"> &#147;Then he made a large throne. It was covered with ivory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldMakesEverythingShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldMakesEverythingShiny">And that was covered with fine gold</a>. The throne had six steps. It had a rounded top. The throne had armrests on both sides of the seat. A statue of a lion stood on each side of the throne. Twelve lions stood on the six steps. There was one at each end of each step. Nothing like that had ever been made for any other kingdom.&#148; (1 Kings 10:18-20)</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: The King of Israel sends some soldiers to bring Elijah to him. Their leader isn't very respectful, so Elijah makes a snarky comment and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burns them with divine fire</a>. The King sends a second group of soldiers, and their leader, apparently not noticing the charred corpses and burned rocks and whatnot, <em>makes the exact same disrespectful demand as the first</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">The results are predictable.</a> Thankfully, the third batch learned from their mistakes and humbles himself before the prophet, who allows him to take him to the King so he can deliver the Lord's message in person.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a>: Jeroboam had a young son, Ahijah, who died of illness. He was the only one in the family to be buried and mourned because he was the only one in whom God found any good.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopWife">Top Wife</a>: In 2nd Chronicles 11:21, it says that King Rehoboam of Judah loved Maacah above all the wives and concubines he married (for he had married eighteen wives and had taken sixty concubines), and thus her son Abijah was chosen to be the crown prince that would succeed him as king.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake">Tragic Mistake</a><ul><li> Hezekiah showed off Judah's treasures to Babylonian envoys and ended up putting his country on Babylon's hit list.</li><li> Josiah goes off to fight against Egypt and gets killed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet">Trash the Set</a>: The Babylonians destroy the Temple and leave it in ruins until the time of the Persian-Medo empire when the Jewish exiles returned home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticCSection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticCSection">Traumatic C-Section</a>:<ul><li> In 2nd Kings 8:12-13, Elisha told Hazael, the servant of King Ben-Hadad of Syria (Aram), that he would become king and then he would attack the people of Israel and rip open pregnant women in the attacks.</li><li> In 2nd Kings 15:16, Menahem, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> successor to King Shallum of Israel, attacked Tiphsah and all the territory of Tirzah, because they did not open to him, ripping open pregnant women as he struck down the people.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>: Elijah does this to Baal's prophets, even remarking that maybe Baal is doing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">"business"</a> or (as another translation puts it) "stopped by the wayside."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Turn the Other Cheek</a>: When the Syrian army surrounds Elisha&#146;s home in order to kill him, God blinds the army, and Elisha leads them to Samaria, where they are then surrounded by the Israelite army. But when the king asks (twice!) whether they should kill the Syrians, Elisha objects and instead orders that they be fed and allowed to return to Syria. Later, when the Syrian army puts Samaria under siege, leading to a countrywide famine, the Israelite king <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishedForSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishedForSympathy">calls for Elisha to be beheaded</a>!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualDysphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualDysphemism">Unusual Dysphemism</a>: God uses the term "one who urinates against a wall" in reference to males that are considered worthy of slaughter, particularly of the royal families of evil kings of the northern kingdom of Israel, equating those men to dogs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper">The Usurper</a>: Queen Athaliah of Judah, who, when her son was dead, decided to kill all his heirs so that she could have the throne to herself. She would be removed from the throne several years later when the heir who was rescued from her, Joash, was rightfully made king.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VorpalPillow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VorpalPillow">Vorpal Pillow</a>: In 2nd Kings chapter 8, Hazael the servant of King Ben-hadad of Aram smothered his liege to death with a wet cloth on his face so that he would become king in his place.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIsYourXNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIsYourXNow">Where Is Your X Now?</a><ul><li> When Elijah competes with the priests of Baal over whose god can light their sacrifice, he makes fun of the other priests using lines similar to this trope.</li><li> King Sennacherib of Assyria does this to King Hezekiah when he threatens to destroy Judah, saying "where are the gods" of the nations that he had conquered and suggesting that Hezekiah's God will not save him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">It doesn't work well for the Assyrian king</a> when, after King Hezekiah prays to God, Sennacherib finds that all 185,000 of his troops are dead.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>: Or in this case, Worthless White Rocks, as 1st Kings chapter 10 said that King Solomon had so much gold that silver was accounted as nothing during the time of his reign, that it was as common as stones.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>:<ul><li> A theory is that this is why Jezebel and her family got such a negative portrayal. As all of them were killed off, there was nobody around to tell their side of the story. Their opponents (who had won in the battle of faiths) were thus able to slander them as much as they wanted to.</li><li> And as for their kingdom in general: Around 720 BC, Israel was overrun by the Assyrians, while Judah was saved by a timely civil war, that shortly thereafter broke out in the Assyrian Empire and continued to exist for a good 200 additional years. So all somewhat contemporary surviving records of that time come from the priesthood in Jerusalem, which explains why the inhabitants and kings especially of the northern kingdom are described in such a negative light.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>: King Ahab is surrounded by a bunch of prophets who basically act like this when he asks them whether he and King Jehoshaphat should attack Ramoth Gilead or refrain, with all of them saying, "Go ahead and attack, for the Lord will deliver them into your hand." Micaiah son of Imlah, the only true prophet of the Lord present, tells the king that the Lord has put a lying spirit into the mouths of those other prophets in order to get him to fall in the battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>: King Ahab is warned by Micaiah the prophet that he will die in the battle of Ramoth Gilead. Ahab tries to avert the disaster by dressing up in different clothes before going into battle while King Jehoshaphat wears his royal clothes, hoping that the Syrian army will go after Jehoshaphat instead of him. However, an arrow shot at random pierces King Ahab.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">Your Days Are Numbered</a>: Isaiah the prophet tells King Hezekiah to get his house in order because he was going to die soon of a seemingly incurable illness. Hezekiah prays desperately to God, and God has Isaiah tell the king that He will give him fifteen more years to live.</li></ul><hr>
