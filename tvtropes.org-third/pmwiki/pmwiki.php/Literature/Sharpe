Though a fictional character, he's portrayed as being in the thick of real battles that occurred during the Napoleonic Wars, from the Siege of Seringapatam to the Battle of Waterloo; the novels are as much about the Duke of Wellington's campaigns shown from a new perspective as he fights the armies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte</a>. Cornwell has been writing and publishing the novels out of chronological order: <em>Sharpe's Eagle</em>, published in 1981, is 8th in the series; <em>Sharpe's Devil</em>, chronologically the last in the series, was published in 1992, and <em>Sharpe's Fury</em>, the most recent novel published, is 11th in the series.</p><p>The novels have been adapted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe">a series of television movies</a> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanBean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanBean">Sean Bean</a> as Richard Sharpe, alongside Daragh O'Malley as Patrick Harper and a slew of British talent in supporting roles (see Trivia), running regularly between 1993 and 1997, and with two additional miniseries in 2006 and 2008. The series was well-received and proved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole">a breakout role</a> for Bean, who went on to star in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>.

Sharpe says he'll deal with Orange, with Doggett assuming he means he'll talk to the Prince.

Pierre Ducos in particular just <em>has</em> to humiliate and utterly destroy Sharpe in all of his schemes, which hamstrings them because Sharpe always gets past them. Sharpe in India keeps trying to kill Hakeswill in elaborate ways involving animals, which never work, and he never sticks around to see the outcome: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Tipoo Sultan's tigers don't eat Hakeswill because they've been fed. Hakeswill escapes being crushed by Dowlat Rao Scindia's elephant by jabbing it with a knife.

Notably, the Inquisitor, Father Hacha, is a foul individual, as is the Cardinal of Naples, who seems to have read about Rodrigo Borgia and tried to imitate him as far as possible, only with more child abuse.

His begging does not help.</li><li> Pierre Ducos goes through a long one, Sharpe now inhabiting his very nightmares.</li><li> Lord Fenner, when his former sex slave turns up with the evidence to ruin him, has a surprisingly brief one.</li><li> Colonel Girdwood has one on his first taste of battle.<ul><li> And another one whenever a dog approaches.</li><li> And another whenever he is reminded of anything Irish.</li></ul></li><li> Simmerson has <em>many</em> but his most notable is after Wellington tells him off after he finds he caused the Kings Colours to be lost.</li><li> Hakeswill's final raging denial: "You can't kill ME!".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValor">Villainous Valor</a>: Notably, Calvet, Loup, the Comte de Moromuorto and De L'Eclin are not afraid of Sharpe and are more than capable of going toe-to-toe with him. The Tipoo Sultan is the ultimate example, being one of the few men who Sharpe truly respects.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a>: Jorge Vicente is a lawyer by trade and a nature-loving philosopher and poet by inclination. Then he joins the Portuguese army, and swiftly proves himself to be courageous, intelligent, a natural leader, and highly capable in battle.<div class="indent">"I love my country more than I love Monsieur Rousseau," Vicente said sadly, "So I shall be a soldier before I am a poet."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>: Sharpe uses a Baker Rifle and a 1796 heavy cavalry sabre for fighting in close quarters. He prefers, and is much more skilled with, the rifle. Not only is the pairing very effective in combat as the cavalry sword is able to power through lighter officer swords and the rifle has more range and accuracy than either a musket or a pistol, but they serve as a reminder of the character's humble beginnings and where he is now. Sgt. Harper, Sharpe's second-in-command, uses a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nock_gun">Nock gun<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">a seven-barrelled rifle developed in limited numbers by the Royal Navy</a>; the gun has understandably immense firepower, <em>especially</em> at close range and with it, ridiculous recoil (in real life the British found the gun was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a> as it was very heavy, very slow to reload and it would even often injure the operator by breaking or dislocating their shoulder; Harper never experiences this issue).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: Several of the officers and commanders take this attitude in the books. Sharpe however makes it his mission to convince the troops that they are more than that. Sharpe will often get angry at pointless loss of life or loss of troops. Often this brings him into some kind of conflict with said leaders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">What Does She See in Him?</a>: The sentiment many have in regards to Sharpe when some wealthy or privileged lady takes an interest in him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Sharpe and Teresa's baby daughter, Antonia, is taken by Teresa's family, and just disappears after that. Partly justified, since Sharpe seems to consider her better off being raised by her aunt and uncle than by him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?</a>: If Sharpe had just told Teresa to kill Hakeswill when she had a knife at his throat, there wouldn't have been any problem. They spend that entire series knowing that he's trouble and reacting to all the underhanded things he does and they never just kill him. This is likely, aside from narrative purposes, to be because it is made clear that Hakeswill is an absolute master at brown-nosing the officer class and is thought of as a superb Sergeant by them for that very reason.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: Sharpe regards Napoleon as one in the books. They seem to get on pretty well when they meet in <em>Sharpe's Devil</em>.<ul><li> The Tippoo Sultan in <em>Sharpe's Tiger</em>. While Sharpe does loot the jewels from his body, he leaves the Tippoo's sword, and salutes him as he dies, outright saying he deserves to keep it, as he fought hard and died like a soldier.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Sharpe, being born in a London slum in the 1770s, does things that his contemporaries would either find unexceptional and that they would find as shocking as modern readers do. Examples would be cuckolding husbands and the revenge murders of Berry and Gibbons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>:<ul><li> Whenever Sharpe has to get somewhere by ship in the books, particularly in <em>Sharpe's Trafalgar</em> and <em>Sharpe's Devil</em>.</li><li> Sharpe finds himself at the heart of the battle of Trafalgar onboard a British Warship.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: Quite a few of the books will have an honourable French sergeant or something, but particular mention goes to the deeply-likeable General Calvet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreckedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreckedWeapon">Wrecked Weapon</a>: <em>Sharpe's Sword</em>. Sharpe's sword breaks and Sergeant Harper sets out to find a new one for him while Sharpe is recovering from a near lethal injury and subsequent infection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureInsane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureInsane">You're Insane!</a>: <em>Sharpe's Devil</em> has the "one-hero-to-another" version, delivered by Sharpe (who's had enough of war) to Cochrane (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">definitely hasn't</a>).</li></ul><hr><p><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">Boromir</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">would have fared better if he could fire three rounds per minute in any weather!</a></em></p>
