It centered on a trio of high school boys who live in the fictional town of Rocky Beach, California. They are:</p><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Jupiter Jones</a></strong>, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">First Investigator</a></strong>. Head of the firm and known for his remarkable powers of observation and deduction, he is stocky, muscular, and a bit roly-poly. He has a round face which often looks stupid but which hides a sharp intelligence. Jupiter has an excellent mind, and he is rather proud of it. He has many good features, but undue modesty is not one of them.</p><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Pete Crenshaw</a></strong>, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Second Investigator</a></strong>. Tall and muscular, sturdy and courageous, he excels at athletics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Inclined to nervousness before anything happens</a>, but a tower of strength in any kind of trouble. He is Jupiter's right-hand man when it comes to trailing suspects and other dangerous activities. Pete's father is a special-effects man who works at one of the movie studios in Hollywood.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Bob Andrews</a></strong>, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Records and Research</a></strong>. Slight of build, small but wiry. Studious in nature, he is something of a scholarly type with an adventurous spirit. He has great nerve and the courage of a lion. Adept at research, he works part-time at the local library which enables him to hunt up information needed for their investigations. Bob's father is a feature writer for a big newspaper in Los Angeles.</p><p>The boys spend their free time solving various mysteries rather than true crimes, mysteries which tended to be far more bizarre, unusual, complex, and intriguing than those of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a></em> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective">Kid Detective</a> books of the day, and with protagonists who were simply ordinary, middle-class American boys, without the riches or special advantages of sleuths such as, again, <em>The Hardy Boys</em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em>, both of which had famous fathers who helped them out in their cases a great deal.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The three boys make an excellent team. Having formed the firm of The Three Investigators, they use their spare time to solve any riddles, enigmas and mysteries that come their way. Their motto is "We Investigate Anything". Headquarters for The Three Investigators is a damaged 30-foot mobile home trailer within the salvage yard run by Jupiter's Uncle Titus and Aunt Mathilda which has been cleverly hidden from view by stacks of junk which surround it. It is accessible only by several secret passages and hidden entrances including their favorite, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Tunnel Two</a>. Headquarters contains a small laboratory, a dark room, and an office with a desk, typewriter, telephone, tape recorder and reference books. All of their equipment was rebuilt from junk that came into the salvage yard.</p><p>For traveling long distances, the boys have the use of a gold-plated Rolls Royce, complete with a chauffeur, Worthington. Jupiter won the use of this auto, for thirty days, in a contest. (A grateful client from the seventh book in the series, <em>The Mystery of the Fiery Eye</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">indefinitely extended the time that they could make use of the Rolls</a>.) For local travel, the boys ride their bicycles or have one of the salvage yard helpers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Hans or Konrad</a>, drive them in one of the trucks.</p><p>Adding to this quasi-realism was the real-life movie director, Alfred Hitchcock, who appeared in the original texts of the first thirty titles. His character provided the introductory and closing remarks in each book and, acting as a mentor, he was occasionally called upon by The Three Investigators during the course of solving a mystery. The real Alfred Hitchcock had little to do with the creation of these books. He was simply paid a handsome percentage for the use of his name and character. This provided brand-name recognition and helped boost sales of the books.</p><p>Following Robert Arthur's death, the writing of the series was taken over by several successive authors &#151; two titles by Nick West (pseudonym of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KinPlatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KinPlatt">Kin Platt</a>), three by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarcBrandel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarcBrandel">Marc Brandel</a>, and the bulk of them penned by William Arden (pseudonym of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisLynds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisLynds">Dennis Lynds</a>) and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MVCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MVCarey">MV Carey</a>.</p><p>The long-standing popularity of the series in Germany has resulted in two live-action movies, <em>The Three Investigators and the Secret of Skeleton Island</em> and <em>The Three Investigators and the Secret of Terror Castle</em>.</p><hr><h2><em>The Three Investigators</em> provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropes A-C&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">Absurdly Spacious Sewer</a>: <em>The Mystery of the Silver Spider</em> had the young heroes escape the villains in the storm drain system of a very old city. They meet up with some allies <em>rowing a boat through the drain</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">Logical Weakness</a>:<ul><li> By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>, the very thing the Investigators need to get around Southern California, the Rolls-Royce, is also so conspicuous it allows the villains (and Skinny Norris) to know what they're doing and where they've been, as they discover right away in <em>Stuttering Parrot</em> and again in <em>Fiery Eye</em>. They also discover that the Ghost-to-Ghost Hookup, while it allows them to learn information quickly, draws attention to itself too and can allow people they don't want to know about it (like Skinny) to be tipped off thanks to a friend of a friend. The issue with the Rolls-Royce is dealt with by using the car as a decoy on several occasions while they go to their real destination in one of the salvage yard trucks (although this solution and the problem it addressed never came up again in later books, except once when Worthington uses his own car to follow the fellowship to Torrente Canyon in <em>Singing Serpent</em>). The Ghost-to-Ghost Hookup problem quietly vanishes altogether, although it isn't used in many of the books after Arthur's death.</li><li> The junk piled all over the junkyard and especially around Headquarters turns out to be this early on, once the boys realize that while it keeps anyone (especially Aunt Mathilda) from seeing them, it also keeps them from seeing out. Rectified by the invention of the See-All, but it comes up as an important plot point in <em>Deadly Double</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ian Carew is hiding in the junkyard from his kidnappers, since it keeps the trio from finding him, too</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a>: Unusually, this occurs to some degree in <em>Wandering Cave Man</em>, where Jupe encounters a strange pair of travelers in the fog near the junkyard, tries to help them get to where they're going...and then the male traveler has a heart attack and dies, requiring an ambulance be called. This is the first on-screen human death in the series, and it leaves an impression on the reader (and in-story, on Jupe). It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>, for while at first it appears to have nothing to do with the story other than to introduce us to Eleanor Hess and the Spicer Foundation, it ends up being the work of Dr. Birkensteen (the man who died) that is at the heart of the case, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he accidentally discovered a powerful, side-effect-free anesthetic in the course of his work, and it's this which the main villain uses to carry off his theft and ransom scheme via the town's water supply</span>. Also, the beginning of <em>Scar-Faced Beggar</em> involves Bob's encounter with the eponymous character (who nearly gets hit by a car), then a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene">Chase Scene</a>, all while a bank robbery is going on (though this isn't learned by the characters until the next chapter). A few other books had this too, such as <em>Stuttering Parrot</em> (the first encounter with Claudius), <em>Green Ghost</em> (Bob and Pete's very atmospheric visit to Matthias Green's ruined mansion), <em>Shrinking House</em> (the pursuit of the figure in black from the cottage to the barranca), and <em>Magic Circle</em> (the boys being trapped in the fire at Amigos Press).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>: A favorite of the book titles, as in <em>Green Ghost, Silver Spider, Crooked Cat, Flaming Footprints, Singing Serpent, Monster Mountain, Dancing Devil, Headless Horse, Deadly Double, Sinister Scarecrow, Purple Pirate, Missing Mermaid, Trail of Terror, Rogues' Reunion, Creep-Show Crooks, Wrecker's Rock, Cranky Collector, Dancing Dinosaur, House of Horrors</em> and <em>Savage Statue</em>. By the early '80s, alliterative titles were almost obligatory, before being dropped for the <em>Crimebusters</em> re-launch.<ul><li> Also, Jupiter Jones, Liz Logan, the Great Gulliver, Maximilian the Mystic, Sarah Sandow, Carson's Colossal Carnival, Doc Dawson, Java Jim, the Mosby Museum, Francesca Fontaine, Miss Maureen Melody, Luther Lomax, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> Claude Claudius. And the Verdant Valley Vineyard.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> Although the boys get in danger a number of times and often worry their families, <em>Deadly Double</em> has the most sobering and unsettling example of this when Jupiter is kidnapped not once, but twice...and not only Bob and Pete but Worthington, Chief Reynolds, Uncle Titus, and Aunt Mathilda have to worry about international political extremists and whether they will ever see him alive again (because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">He Knows Too Much</a>). It is handled quite seriously and realistically throughout the book, making it one of the better and more tense entries in the series.</li><li> A brief moment in <em>Shrinking House</em>, when Skinny has been kidnapped <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by Marechal</span>. Although she at first confronts Maxwell James and Pete, thinking they have something to do with it, Mrs. Norris's worry and fear for her son are played out quite realistically, even as she acknowledges Skinny's failings and what she didn't know about his doings. It's enough to make even the boys feel sorry for him and want to help save him. (It's also the only time we ever meet her in the series, and she is nothing like his father, so the moment is memorable and telling.)</li><li> Regina Stratten in <em>Missing Mermaid</em>. Not only does her little five-year-old boy disappear twice, but the second disappearance involves his trusted canine companion being found dead in a trash bin, followed by days of being hounded by the press while she worries where he might be, who might have him, and why. How close he came to being eliminated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark Burton</span> and the fact he was eventually found in the company of a simple-minded vagrant (albeit completely harmless) doesn't help either.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>: Several times (for example, in <em>Shrinking House</em> and <em>Dead Man's Riddle</em>) Skinny Norris receives a bad scare/brush with danger and death that seems to convince him of the error of his ways. But in the next book he's always back at it again, jealously pursuing and competing with the Investigators, until finally being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> (and <em>maybe</em> having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>) in <em>Headless Horse</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Hugenay.<div class="indent"><strong>Hugenay</strong>: Ah, Claude. Fancy meeting you here. America isn't such a large place after all.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Hugenay</strong>: This is the gentleman you met a little while ago in a picturesque spot in Merita Valley.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAsiansKnowMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAsiansKnowMartialArts">All Asians Know Martial Arts</a>: Pete amusingly thinks this of Kyoto in <em>Two-Toed Pigeon</em> when worrying about what will happen to him should the Japanese catch on to his stalling trick.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsLikePonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsLikePonies">All Girls Like Ponies</a>: Allie and her Appaloosa, Queenie. She actually does serve a purpose in the story in <em>Singing Serpent</em>, however, as her oat bin is where Allie hides the diamond necklace and Pete uses her to trample and capture Shaitan at the climax.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters">All That Glitters</a>: The novels contained versions of this periodically. One that comes to mind lacked a clear moral: A sunken riverboat holding a watertight chest contained millions of dollars&#151;in worthless Confederate money. It may have been worthless when the book was written, anyway. But these days, preserved Confederate money is worth more than US currency of the same denomination, with mint-condition bills of $100 and $500 worth tens of thousands of dollars.

The villains of the book <em>also</em> made use of the trope by drawing on the park's legendary haunting to keep anyone from finding their hidden bank robbery loot. The second amusement park, in <em>Crooked Cat</em>, served mostly as a set piece for chase scenes, as well as some of the more creepy, suspenseful moments in the book, and also acted as a ready source of hiding places, red herrings, and escapes for the villain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>: A number of the boys' enemies turn out to be this, either having sympathetic reasons for doing what they do, not genuinely wishing to hurt anyone, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil">Forced into Evil</a>, performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, or simply being too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> to be hated.

Not only are they unfairly (and completely without justification) superior toward Eleanor, acting as if she thinks she's above herself just because she wants to go to college (and her aunt had specifically resented her sister, Eleanor's mother, for being beautiful and making something of herself with an education), they are actively robbing her of both the insurance she was owed after her parents' accident and her inheritance in the form of a house in Hollywood and its rent...so she never has enough money to live on and is forced to stay with them, all while being guilted for how much she supposedly costs. As if that isn't enough, the pair are greedy in other ways, charging far too much money for rent on their property when the town is full of tourists for the cave man, and it's very clear in how Newt acts toward Dr. Brandon that he has no respect for anthropology, only wanting to create a sensationalist story so he can bilk all the people who come to see his kitschy tourist trap.

Aside from simply being a nasty, vindictive, suspicious, and insulting old man, as well as something of a miser, it becomes clear from the number of people who hate him and what he has done to them or their friends and relatives in the past that Pilcher is a rather crooked and unethical businessman. There's also the way he treats his daughter as well as the hired help (including the boys) and that the reason for his kidnapping turns out to revolve around a secret South American emerald mine he used to supplement his income whenever money was scarce (after leaving his former partner in the scheme to take the fall for his theft of the antique book that revealed its location&mdash;the man was a thief and dangerous criminal himself, but this was still a rather selfish thing to do). This last is particularly noteworthy since despite this criminal activity, Pilcher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">gets off scot-free</a> at the end, partly due to having been a kidnap victim, partly because the mine in question is no longer his but now worked openly by a legitimate business.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>:<ul><li> M.V. Carey, a later author in the series, seems to have had a fixation on the supernatural since it figures prominently in at least four of the titles she wrote: <em>Singing Serpent</em>, <em>Invisible Dog</em>, <em>Haunted Mirror</em>, and <em>Magic Circle</em>. She also wrote stories involving cryptozoology and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSaucer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSaucer">UFO</a> sightings (<em>Monster Mountain</em> and <em>Blazing Cliffs</em>, respectively). Even <em>Flaming Footprints</em> and <em>Sinister Scarecrow</em> had vaguely supernatural elements, although the "ghost" leaving footprints and walking scarecrow were just done with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">chemicals and a costume</a>. She also seems to have a thing for small countries with bloody revolutions in either their past or present, since this appears as the backstory in <em>Flaming Footprints</em>; something one of the well-meaning antagonists wants to prevent in <em>Haunted Mirror</em>; and something the villains are actually trying to bring about in <em>Scar-Faced Beggar</em>.</li><li> William Arden, meanwhile, seemed to have a thing for villains who wore costumes or disguises, since this appeared in his very first entry in the series (<em>Moaning Cave</em>) and continued in <em>Crooked Cat</em> (a double disguise, even!), <em>Phantom Lake</em>, <em>Dancing Devil</em>, and <em>Purple Pirate</em>, and even had brief appearances in <em>Shrinking House</em>, <em>Shark Reef</em>, and <em>Smashing Glass</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>:<ul><li> Interviews reveal that Robert Arthur saw much of himself in Bob Andrews and often wrote his traits into the character.

On the other hand, it's hard to believe someone who once took in a wandering horse as a pet would be as distrustful and wary around Queenie in <em>Singing Serpent</em> as he was (though that could have been his feelings for Allie bleeding over); his feelings about caged birds (or birds at all) were nowhere in evidence with Blackbeard and the other parrots in <em>Stuttering Parrot</em> (though he could have developed these views thanks to those experiences&mdash;it's also odd, considering the number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> he did, that Brandel didn't mention Blackbeard here); and there was never any evidence of Pete and his family keeping pets (though admittedly he's the boy about whose family life the least is known).

Black-clad El Diablo of <em>Moaning Cave</em> is a zigzagged example, since depending on POV he was either a good guy (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero">Folk Hero</a> to the Mexican people) or a villain (the American authorities, who were the ones to give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron">his nickname</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">"The Devil"</a>), but the one encountered in-story is of course a costume worn by the villain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommissionerGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommissionerGordon">The Commissioner Gordon</a>: Chief Reynolds, from <em>Green Ghost</em> onwards.

This does not tell them why the smasher is skipping blocks (until they learn those blocks were where there were police stakeouts) or how he knows to skip them (he's being warned by listening to the police band with his radio and headphones), nor does it tell them why he's doing the smashing, but it does at least give them an M.O. and proves the crimes are neither random nor juvenile vandalism.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail">Conservation of Detail</a>: Just about everything in the books is relevant or becomes a clue.

A small <em>glass statue</em>, which they are hired to find.

Justified in-story, however, by the fact that in order to create the proper ambiance, the villains used curtains that were both very thick and billowy and which extended farther than usual onto the floor (to keep any light from getting in)&mdash;and so there was no way for Jupiter's shoes or body to give him away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">Cut Lex Luthor a Check</a>: Inverted in <em>Wandering Cave Man</em>&mdash;the whole reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Hoffer</span> becomes a villain is because he's afraid the Spicer Foundation <em>won't</em> pay him their million dollar grant, instead giving it to one of his colleagues.

Carey in particular included things such as bloody revolutions, dictators, and villains determined to gain power in either the present or in backstory in both <em>Flaming Footprints</em> and <em>Haunted Mirror</em> (and this is taken far more seriously and grimly than Duke Stefan's conspiracy in <em>Silver Spider</em>); there's even a case of terrorist gunrunning in <em>Scar-Faced Beggar</em> which is put to an end via a fiery boat explosion. There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion">Scam Religion</a> cult in <em>Singing Serpent</em> and how it affects Aunt Pat; the slew of crimes in <em>Invisible Dog</em> including extortion, stock speculation, poisoning, bombing, and a fire; the serious results of finding a dead body in <em>Death Trap Mine</em>; and the boys being caught inside a burning building in <em>Magic Circle</em>. Nick West also has the example of the boys almost getting killed by a panther in <em>Nervous Lion</em>, resulting in it being shot in front of them. One of the strongest examples of the trope is <em>Deadly Double</em> however, where international politics, kidnapping and blackmail all come into play, Uncle Titus and Aunt Mathilda are put through a very real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>, the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">shows his work</a> in how the local, county, state, and federal authorities work together in a kidnapping case, and having the freedom of another country and its indigenous people at stake; Arden does not shy away one bit from revealing the racism and extremism of the villains, or making clear what will happen in Nanda if they succeed, and right up to the last moment it appears they're going to get away across the Mexican border.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>:<ul><li> <em>Monster Mountain</em> is this for Hans and Konrad, since the story is all about going to the Sierra Nevada town where their cousin Anna runs an inn; because it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has been replaced by an impostor who is helping a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a> swindle Anna out of her money</span>, they are far more involved in the plot than usual, especially in the climax.</li><li> <em>Deadly Double</em> is this for Bob and Pete as well; since Jupiter gets kidnapped twice, a great deal of the plot involves the two of them (working with the police, of course) doing everything they can to track down the villains and rescue him. Pete figures out the kidnappers took Jupe over grassy ground where their tracks wouldn't show into the chaparral, while Bob finds the business card and question mark he leaves behind; Pete realizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miss Lessing</span> is lying to them by catching on to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">I Never Said It Was Poison</a> bit with needing to identify Ian, and realizes there's a hidden basement under the house, while Bob identifies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> as the helicopter pilot by the missing earring and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> rushed home because Jupiter was being held there. They also figure out the meaning of Ian's "Djanga's place" clue before Jupiter does. It's not surprising Hitchcock observed they did "more shrewd work than their leader" on this case (although Jupiter did contribute greatly to the plot, particularly Ian's rescue at the end). This is a great example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> too, since in early books Jupiter insisted they hone their deductive reasoning skills (and often used pranks and object lessons to teach them); apparently by the later books, these lessons have paid off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: At various times all the boys get in on this, but Bob especially seems prone to it in the M.V. Carey books, often of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> nature. (And one time where he actually seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">Genre Blind</a>, it's Jupiter who calls him out on it.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>:<ul><li> The earliest books by the series creator Robert J. Arthur made a strong attempt to differentiate the boys' personalities, as well as showing their different interests and intellect levels, so that depending on the case Bob or Pete might have the clue to crack the case rather than Jupe, and their temperaments and personalities determined what roles they played in the investigation or finding the solution. Later books in the series, however, tended to lose some of this characterization so that, as one fansite put it, it almost didn't matter whether Bob or Pete were in the scene or said a certain line because they had become interchangeable. Who made the most jokes or was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> also varied from author to author (and book to book).</li><li> Jupe's being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">Former Child Star</a> factored into a great many of the early cases (unsurprisingly, as they were written by the author who invented that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>), and the subsequent authors tried to include it in their early books too&#133; but eventually this element faded from the series, save for one late attempt by Marc Brandel and another in the Crimebusters series to bring it back.</li><li> Jupe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> status also fluctuated, even within the Robert Arthur books, where things one would think he'd have discovered and read about turn out to be something he's never heard of &#151; his error in not recognizing Octavian to be Caesar Augustus is particularly egregious &#151; and things he learned in one case don't carry over to another &#151; discovering that uncut diamonds look just like regular rocks when they come out of the earth in <em>Moaning Cave</em> somehow escapes his memory when the coded cable message in <em>Nervous Lion</em> refers to "rocks".</li><li> And Pete, who somehow has knowledge on how to work with trained animals in <em>Crooked Cat</em> courtesy of his father (how would a movie producer come by such knowledge?), shows no such skill in <em>Nervous Lion</em> when confronted by George; this is particularly noteworthy since he otherwise does show knowledge he learned from his father when talking about Jay Eastland and watching the filming.</li><li> What is Jupe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTic">Character Tic</a> for when he's in deep thought? In Arthur's books, it's pinching his lip. In other writers' books, it's chewing his lip.</li><li> Early books hid the nature of the boys' doing from the adults in their lives for the most part&mdash;they knew they were detectives, but not their methods or what all they did. But by <em>Dead Man's Riddle</em> Pete is able to tell his father about the Ghost-to-Ghost Hookup without even blinking (and the dialogue implies he had even told him before this). This could also be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>, however, since eventually with the sheer number of cases they undertook, the boys couldn't hide it all forever&mdash;and in the specific case of the Hookup, they'd do better to tell the adults about it and explain how it worked than leave them in the dark; Jupiter at least would likely have figured out the chances of them interfering by that point were greater if they didn't know than if they did.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescriptionCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescriptionCut">Description Cut</a>: After being captured by Rawley and the gnomes in <em>Vanishing Treasure</em>, Jupe and Pete are certain Miss Agawam will call the police once she finds them missing, and they'll be saved. Immediately the next chapter cuts to her finding their empty bedroom, deciding they were scared by the gnomes and fled, and calling her nephew in fear to come pick her up, doing nothing to effect a rescue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectiveDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectiveDrama">Detective Drama</a>: Of the 'closed mystery' sort.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">Direct Line to the Author</a>: The very first book has Jupiter claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">all successful, well-known detectives had someone who wrote their cases for them</a>, thus making them known to a larger audience and lending their notoriety to the marketing process.

Since this scene is from the POV of the butler however, who is predisposed to view Anubis as evil and frightening, this may just be an in-story invocation of the trope. And considering the thief in question had been told to dress up that way by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">someone knowledgeable about ancient Egypt</span>, it's extremely likely the villain would be aware of the maligning and misunderstanding of a death-related deity and thus was exploiting the trope as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuspect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuspect">Everyone Is a Suspect</a>: In <em>Cranky Collector</em>, due to everyone at the wedding party for the eponymous collector's daughter having a good reason to hate the victim or want him ruined/mistreated/brought to harm in some fashion, if not physically.

It gets to the point that finding out Pilcher's personal secretary is secretly the son of a man he drove out of business actually makes him sympathetic to the boys (and the reader), and no one can blame him when, after assisting in the old man's rescue from his kidnapper and being snapped at and disparaged by Pilcher, the fellow lashes back and refuses to help him any further.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Countess and Marechal from <em>Shrinking House</em>, Professor Shay from <em>Phantom Lake</em>, "Thurgood" from <em>Death Trap Mine</em>, Doc Dawson from <em>Nervous Lion</em>, Professor Walsh from <em>Moaning Cave</em>, Sarah Temple from <em>Smashing Glass</em>, Luther Lomax from <em>Rogues' Reunion</em>...</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit">Evil Aussie</a>: The villain of <em>Laughing Shadow</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilNephew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilNephew">Evil Nephew</a>: At least half of the nephews and nieces who appear in the books are scheming figures (although rarely the main villain of the book, and often getting some level of redemption at the end).

The main difference of, course, is there being only this small cast instead of a constantly changing roster as actors grew up; the actors are also all still alive, but as the story takes place when they are young adults, there thankfully isn't an opportunity yet for any kind of "death curse" to occur.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">Faking the Dead</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stephen Terrill.

If he hadn't done this (and if he hadn't been so nasty and trouble-making to begin with so as to earn Mr. Peck's enmity), they likely never would have suspected him of anything, and his scheme certainly wouldn't have unraveled&mdash;since it's because of Peck assaulting him for supposedly following and spying on him that the camera and its incriminating film gets mistakenly switched with Bob's.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">It Only Works Once</a>: Variation&mdash;in <em>Shrinking House</em> the boys are told that people unfamiliar to the area where the case takes place only fall in the barranca on the property once (thus learning it's there and avoiding it in future).

Amusingly, this is subverted once in <em>Wreckers' Rock</em> when the adult in question is their school principal, who knows their history teacher has not in fact assigned any special reports&mdash;but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">who also</a> still takes them seriously because he knows of their status as real detectives who have helped Chief Reynolds and whose talents he has need of.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsQuietTooQuiet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsQuietTooQuiet">It's Quiet&#133; Too Quiet</a>: Done extremely effectively and unnervingly in <em>Monster Mountain</em> when Bob is searching in the woods and about to come upon the local Bigfoot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWontTurnOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWontTurnOff">It Won't Turn Off</a>: In <em>Terror Castle</em>, the boys are told about the cursed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousPipeOrgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousPipeOrgan">Ominous Pipe Organ</a> that played both when nobody was near it, and when it was unplugged.

At least twice though, a villain did actually escape despite the very real crimes they committed&mdash;Jensen, Mr. Won's minion in <em>Green Ghost</em>, gets away (as does, for that matter, Mr. Won), while Rawley and his gang escape in <em>Vanishing Treasure</em>. This last is notable not only because of the determined attempt by the boys that the "gnomes" of that case did <em>not</em> get to be this trope, but because of what Rawley did: he was an exceedingly clever criminal who almost got away with his loot, he coldly threatened Jupe and Pete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CementShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CementShoes">being dumped off a ship with bags of silver coins tied to them</a>, and while he, like so many kids in the neighborhood growing up, had been one of Miss Agawam's gnomes and came to visit her frequently, he repays her as an adult by using the "gnomes" to frighten her into moving so she wouldn't discover the tunnel being dug under her house.

He appoints himself First Investigator and makes no effort to hide why he considered this the right choice, demonstrating time and again what skills place him in the position. At the same time, despite his pomposity, he always gives Bob and Pete credit where it is due, working to include their thoughts and reasoning in cases, never belittling them or their skills (at worst getting annoyed when they don't see an "obvious" clue that he does, or gently mocking Pete for his cowardly ways). He makes an effort on several occasions to point out to clients how all three of them are essential and have important roles, times when only they can do what needs to be done, and he also encourages them to be more proactive in pursuing clues and thinking deductively even as he remains in charge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">Lemony Narrator</a>: In <em>Whispering Mummy</em>, after Hamid is horrified at Americans eating dogs: "But there was no time now to explain about the mysteries of the American hot dog."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinkedListClueMethodology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinkedListClueMethodology">Linked List Clue Methodology</a>: Twice.

The end result is the person breaking in (a nosy landlady, it turns out, who secretly had a key made) ends up with "the guilty stains" on their fingers&mdash;i.e., she's caught red (or black) handed&mdash;and because it won't wash off by normal means she's even seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutDamnedSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutDamnedSpot">constantly rubbing and wiping her hands</a> when they confront her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Literal-Minded</a>: During the Crimebusters series, Pete once gave Jupiter a hard time because during one chance he had with a girl, he ended up blowing it by boring her with a detailed explanation of the structure of the atom because "she wanted to get to the basics."

On the other hand, however the relationship started, it seems clear there was genuine love involved&mdash;Mr. Won, when speaking of the matter, observed that Green had "stolen" a bride but also that "women follow their hearts", and the way Green made a memorial coffin for her in a secret room suggests great devotion. And while he took to wearing Mandarin robes in his mansion, something that could suggest a fetishizing of the exotic Eastern Other, it's just as likely (when combined with them having only Chinese servants) that he was doing it to make her feel at home or because he had even come to genuinely enjoy the culture himself. So if this was how the two became involved, it at least seems to have been a bit more complicated and realistic than the stereotype.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot">Minor Crime Reveals Major Plot</a>: Classic example in <em>Missing Mermaid</em>, where the disappearance of Todd Stratten ends up uncovering not only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark Burton</span>'s secret other life as a fence and thief but also his involvement with Mooch Henderson's roommate and the slave market (which in turn inadvertently reveals Mooch's racket with stealing dogs and then 'returning' them for rewards).

In their over 30 years long history in Germany the boys have aged only about five to six years. This is in part due to the fact that the <em>Crimebusters</em> spinoff was regarded as a straight continuation of the original series and partly because the popularity of the Audio Adaptations' voice actors didn't allow for them to be switched out without losing the majority of their audience.

Justified by Stephen Terrill having been an actor who not only liked to play his films for guests but came from the silent era when pipe organs were actually used in theaters to provide incidental music. It also contains pipes which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">play notes so low as to be subsonic and affect the human nervous system</a>, thus instilling instinctive terror.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a>: The boys will show their business card, with the slogan "We Investigate Anything", to someone, usually a prospective client.

Also once an episode, there would be an introduction from Alfred Hitchcock (actually written by the author, and later replaced by Hector Sebastian) with a few teaser details about the case at hand and the rest being a nearly identical explanation of their background and how they got together.

Also, the villains of both <em>Coughing Dragon</em> and <em>Scar-Faced Beggar</em> share the name Shelby (albeit as a last name and first name, respectively) although they could not be more different since one is a repentant and mostly harmless trickster while the other is an arrogant, entitled thief, rebel, and traitor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianRetcon">Orwellian Retcon</a>: After 1980, the conceit of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> introduce (through ghost writers) the books and interact with the boys was <span style="display:none">invoked</span><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">no longer feasible</a>.

Sebastian is quite right to reprimand them with the warning they might become "the Two Investigators" if they weren't careful.</li><li> In order to lure out the villain in <em>Smashing Glass</em>, the boys decide they need bait. Jupiter wants to use the Rolls Royce. Despite showing trepidation, uncertainty, and wincing greatly at the possibility, Worthington allows it as a necessary duty undertaken in order to solve a case. While it's true that Worthington's protectiveness of the car could have eased over time, especially after having become an unofficial "fourth investigator", it still seems incredibly unlike the man who once refused to abandon the vehicle until he absolutely had to (to save Jupe and Pete inside Terror Castle) to allow something like this&mdash;and even if he himself had become more sanguine to the possibility, surely he would get in great trouble with the rental agency if he allowed damage to happen to the Rolls while it was under his care. To be fair to Arden, however, he rarely used Worthington much in his entries in the series, so it may be he had forgotten the character's foibles when the time came to write this scene. (On the other hand, plot-wise the situation could have been handled just as easily with Hans or Konrad using one of the salvage yard trucks as bait.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>:<ul><li> An almost literal example at the end of the second book when Huganay, before fleeing the country, calls the boys and tells them where he left the parrots at so they won't starve.</li><li> The villain of <em>Nervous Lion</em> saves the boys' lives once (from a panther that got loose from its cage).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">Photographic Memory</a>: Jupiter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Politically Incorrect Villain</a>:<ul><li> Skinny Norris, in <em>Headless Horse.</em> While prior to this his arrogance, nastiness, and superiority would make such an attitude unsurprising (especially for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> like him, and <em>especially</em> in California where matters of immigration and ethnic foreigners have always been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">rather contentious</a>), his attitude toward Diego and Pico and his use of an outdated slur <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22n7u');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22n7u" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22n7u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">wetback</span> directed at them does come a little out-of-nowhere, and the fact this appears in the book where he commits his worst villainy and is subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for the rest of the series is probably not an accident.

While it is true most of the places the boys had to go in the narrative to find out about Laura's surprise were ones that would have existed apart from Rocky Beach (Powder Gulch, Cabrillo Island, Santa Barbara), and it's entirely possible Gunn built his lodge out in what was then virgin countryside, the Ortega stoneyard seems like the sort of place which would require a town of some sort, at least for their main office. There is, however, a possible reconciliation for this discrepancy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2w3b6');"><sup>Explanation&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2w3b6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2w3b6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Green Ghost</em> didn't say Rocky Beach didn't exist <em>at all</em> before 60-70 years ago, just that it wasn't a town and didn't have a library. It could very well have been as small as Powder Gulch, and thus not been officially incorporated, but still had a place like the Ortega stoneyard (a business which a new and growing town would certainly need). It would also still have had a sheriff (to hunt down and kill the Captain and his men, and to investigate Gunn's journal). Also the publication dates of the books shed a little more light&mdash;<em>Green Ghost</em> came out in 1965 (thus putting 60 or 70 years ago to right around the turn of the century, an appropriate time for Green to have fled China after running his merchant trade there) while <em>Phantom Lake</em> came out in 1973. If it is assumed the stories take place in the years they were published (ignoring the fact the boys never age), that's an eight-year difference, meaning there's only a gap of about twenty-eight years between Gunn's time and Green's. In that time it's possible Rocky Beach still hadn't grown enough to become a town or have a library, so that Green's mansion could still be isolated out in the wilderness the way it was described in the backstory.</span></li><li> While Pete's film knowledge waxes and wanes throughout the books, it seems to be something Brandel missed entirely in his research for the series, since in <em>Rogues' Reunion</em> Pete not only expresses eagerness to "see what goes on behind the scenes at a movie studio" (even if he's never visited one personally, his father has to have told him a great deal about it already and he reveals plenty of behind-the-scenes knowledge in <em>Nervous Lion</em>&mdash;anyway, nothing in the text suggests he already knows anything), but he later asks Jupe why it's called a "sound stage", something he <em>absolutely</em> should know since his father is a sound man as well as a special effects designer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness</a>: Jupiter sometimes falls into this habit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianSmith">Sesquipedalian Smith</a>: Jupiter Jones</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>:<ul><li> After a story revolving around two men going to a great deal of trouble (kidnapping and ransom on one side, leaving a mysterious secret message for his daughter on the other) to either gain access to a lost emerald mine or retain possession of it, it turns out in <em>Cranky Collector</em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">the mine in question had been found long ago by the authorities</a> and was being worked by a regular mining corporation.

Said plot is indeed from an Alfred Hitchcock book, specifically his "Solve-Them-Yourself Mysteries"&mdash;and it was written by Robert Arthur.</li><li> <em>Silver Spider</em> also contains a religious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: in the backstory of Varania's Prince Paul, it's revealed that the reason he made the spider a protected creature (and his personal symbol) was because while fleeing from revolutionaries, he went to hide in an attic, and a spider there formed a web over the door so that when the revolutionaries searched the house, they assumed no one had been in the attic in a long time since they&#146;d have to have torn through the cobweb to get in, and so his life was spared.

(Also note the case involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperstitionEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperstitionEpisode">looking for a stuffed cat which, though striped, is mostly black</a>.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality">This Is Reality</a>: Crops up every once in a while, such as in <em>Fiery Eye</em> when Jupiter is tied up by the villains and thinks, "In stories, when someone was tied up there was always a convenient way to get loose....But he had nothing."

Other than when the case name is mentioned by or to Hitchcock during the ending summation, and when the title refers to a place, it is otherwise never mentioned directly in the books. However there is usually at least one scene where the item or thing in question is referenced or described, with the unique trait or appended adjective mentioned (the parrot that stutters, the mummy that whispers, the clock that screams, the laughing shadow, the lion that's nervous, the headless horse, a scarecrow that's sinister, and so on).

However even in this case all the mysteries end up intertwining or being relevant in some way, even the haunting (which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark Burton</span> is using to keep people from investigating the inn and finding his secret room, though it's otherwise a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>). Another example would be <em>Scar-Faced Beggar</em> which, aside from the beggar, involves a bank robbery, Hector Sebastian as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> suspect, a boat-rental business, a rally for patriotic rebels of a South American country being held at a condemned hotel, a makeup artist, a woman with psychic dreams, and terrorist gunrunners; again, it all ends up being relevant (except for Hector Sebastian, which is just a set-up for him to become the boys' new mentor).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncattyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncattyResemblance">Uncatty Resemblance</a>: In <em>Sinister Scarecrow</em>, Jupiter think the entomologist Dr. Woolley looks rather like an ant himself with his bald head and large bugging eyes; he even starts staring at his forehead, thinking antennae will grow, making Dr. Woolley ask him if he had something on his forehead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadAuthor">Undead Author</a>: Touched on briefly in <em>Moaning Cave</em> when the boys learn of the legend of the Old One&mdash;supposedly no one has ever survived encountering it (and it's invisible, too), yet somehow the legends are still able to say it is black and shiny. When Pete asks about this, Mrs. Dalton laughs and agrees, but also suggests perhaps someone once saw it, told everyone else, and that's how its appearance could be known even if no one later saw it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularSabotage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularSabotage">Vehicular Sabotage</a>: Happens three times where the boys use it to stop a villain's pursuit or escape&mdash;in <em>Shrinking House</em> Bob removes the ignition wires from DeGroot's car, in <em>Dead Man's Riddle</em> Billy takes the distributor cap off of Turk and Savo's car, and in <em>Magic Circle</em> Pete removes the ignition wires from every one of the villains' cars after they arrive at Madeline Bainbridge's estate. He doesn't count on one of them fleeing in Beefy's car however (which still had the key in the ignition). An unusual variation also occurs in <em>Trail of Terror</em>, in which the boys sabotage a motorcycle belonging to a biker gang harassing them...so that when the gang goes to pursue them, its front wheel falls off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTakesAnInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTakesAnInterest">Villain Takes an Interest</a>: In <em>Vanishing Treasure</em>, thanks to admiring Jupiter's intelligence, Rawley keeps offering to take him on as a criminal apprentice.

Another version resulting from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">Blackmail</a> is in <em>Wreckers' Rock</em>, in which Sam Ragnarson joins up with the Gruber brothers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and William Manning</span> to aid in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsuranceFraud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsuranceFraud">Insurance Fraud</a> scam, since he concludes this is a better source of money than digging for lost gold.

William Margon of <em>Smashing Glass</em> claims to be this (his actions being done "just to make you proud") but his father calls him on it, saying he instead wanted to impress him, make money, and be important.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> After the events of <em>Stuttering Parrot</em>, an afterword by Alfred Hitchcock stated that the young Mexican boy Carlos was taken under Worthington's wing, gotten a job washing and cleaning the cars at the Rent 'n' Ride Auto Rental Agency, and allowed to live with the Joneses, earning room and board by helping at the salvage yard. But the reader never sees or hears from him again in any of the later books. Additionally, the mynah bird Blackbeard is adopted by the boys as a sort of mascot for the Three Investigators, but after a few brief appearances he too vanished from the series&mdash;even from the books written by Arthur.<ul><li> At least in the case of "Blacky" the German version subverts this, with the bird being a staple of both the book series and its audio adaptation, where its iconic screech can be heard in almost every episode. He even gets his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">day in the limelight</a> when he is abducted.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Fiery Eye</em>, Bob meets a girl named Liz Logan whose mother has the bust of Octavian they believe holds the jewel. In the process of helping him get it back, she speaks eagerly of wanting to be an investigator too and offers Bob her help if they ever need a girl to assist them in ways a boy couldn't. Bob promises to let her know if such an event ever happens, but despite him seeming genuinely interested in her offer (and not just brushing it and her off as annoying, as Jupe or Pete might), this is never brought up to the others and she never appears in the series again&mdash;though she may have planted the seed for Allie in <em>Singing Serpent</em>. In interviews it was stated that Liz was based on Arthur's own daughter Elizabeth, and that the reason she never appeared in the series again was because Elizabeth decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">"the best way to become a girl operative was to grow up to write stories herself."</a> (And she did.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsASecretFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsASecretFour">What's a Secret Four?</a>: The boys' junkyard-based hideout has a large number of code-named entrances (Green Gate One, Red Gate Rover, etc.). Every mentioned path or doorway was used in at least one of the stories, except for "Secret Four". Although Arthur did mention very early on that there were supposed to be four entrances through the salvage yard fence, but the only ones we ever see are Green Gate One and Red Gate Rover; no later author followed up on this, and in fact in <em>Singing Serpent</em> when Allie has figured out the location of Red Gate Rover and uses it to blackmail the boys into letting her hire them, they speak of building other entrances to replace it. So apparently these others have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> out of existence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell is Rocky Beach?</a>: Unlike most examples of this trope, the location of the fictional Rocky Beach is actually fairly easily guessed due to the specific details of landmarks and distance to other California cities. One fansite has pinpointed it to either Topanga Beach or Ocean Park, California, both within the right distance range of Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Los Angeles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent">Wig, Dress, Accent</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a> worn by the gang working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnownOnlyByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnownOnlyByTheirNickname">Three-Dots</a> in <em>Fiery Eye</em> consists of...fake mustaches and horn-rimmed glasses.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Java Jim of <em>Phantom Lake</em> turns out to be this crossed with either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">Latex Perfection</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveMask">Expressive Mask</a>.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase">Working the Same Case</a>: Two examples, both early in the series&mdash;in <em>Whispering Mummy</em> Pete, fed up with the seemingly supernatural case, decides to go off on his own to investigate a missing cat, only to find out it connects to the mummy. Then in <em>Vanishing Treasure</em> the bank robbery being performed by the "gnomes" they investigate turns out to be perpetrated by the same thieves who stole the Emperor's belt from the museum which had forbidden them from getting involved (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKiddo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKiddo">because they were "just kids"</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessCurrency">Worthless Currency</a>: One book of has two men feuding over a lost safe belonging to a mutual ancestor who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheBlockade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheBlockade">blockade-runner</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> when the money in the safe turns out to be Confederate paper money and is therefore worthless.

In <em>Sinister Scarecrow</em> when Jupiter finds a newspaper and scratch pad near the kitchen phone after the museum robbery, it looks like he's going to use this method to find out what was written there...except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">the thieves didn't bother to throw out the newspaper or the pages in the scratch pad</a>, so the phone number of a shipping company, the name of the ship they were going to escape on, and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the word Vermeer, referencing the painting Mrs. Chumley always wanted</span> were right there to be found.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> of <em>Headless Horse</em>, as referenced by both Hitchcock and Jupiter. The three soldiers who, in their greed, decided to steal the Cortes Sword from Don Sebastian Alvaro made up a fake weapons-smuggling, fake breakout, and fake death for their prisoner, then deserted to pursue him; their report on this is what entered the history books and, without any other documentation or information to contradict, it was believed to be the truth not only by the Army but by Don Sebastian's son Jose. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Helped by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">both</a> Alvaro and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">the deserters</a> died, so that no one remained who could tell what really happened.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Yellow Peril</a>: Mr. Won of <em>Green Ghost</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">You Meddling Kids</a>: The villain of <em>Crooked Cat</em> comes <em>this</em> close to saying the trope name when caught!

One particularly memorable example is in <em>Stuttering Parrot</em> when, after following every clue to the Merita Valley graveyard, they discover the long flat box which had once held the painting holding only a note saying, essentially, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">You didn't read the clues well enough, better luck next time!</a>" The last parrot clue, "I never give a sucker an even break, and that's a lead pipe cinch!" even lampshades this...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">until it turns out</a> it was actually a stealth clue telling them the lead pipe found in the graveyard is the real hiding place for the painting</span>. Another example in <em>Fiery Eye</em>, almost a comedy of errors, not only involves them looking in the wrong bust for the jewel, but finding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakinMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakinMacGuffin">Fakin' MacGuffin</a> version of it, followed by looking in the right bust after <em>it</em> got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StolenMacguffinReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StolenMacguffinReveal">mistakenly switched</a> with one that the villains stole but only finding another note telling them to "delve deeper". Still another example occurs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Dingo Towne</a> and the fake stash of gems in <em>Dead Man's Riddle</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters</a>: Forms the backstory and motivation of the villains in <em>Scar-Faced Beggar</em>.</li></ul></div><hr>
